31571650|t|Therapeutic potential of natural compounds from Chinese medicine in acute and subacute phases of ischemic stroke.
31571650|a|Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in adults worldwide, resulting in huge social and financial burdens. Extracts from herbs, especially those used in Chinese medicine, have emerged as new pharmaceuticals for stroke treatment. Here we review the evidence from preclinical studies investigating neuroprotective properties of Chinese medicinal compounds through their application in acute and subacute phases of ischemic stroke, and highlight potential mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects. It is noteworthy that many herbal compounds have been shown to target multiple mechanisms and in combinations may exert synergistic effects on signaling pathways, thereby attenuating multiple aspects of ischemic pathology. We conclude the paper with a general discussion of the prospects for novel natural compound-based regimens against stroke.

31401319|t|Botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of Ilex pubescens Hook et Arn.
31401319|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ilex pubescens (I. pubescens), which is well known in Chinese as Mao-Dong-Qing, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. This plant is distributed in the wild in southern China, and the roots and stems are used for clearing heat, detoxifying, activating blood circulation and dispelling stasis. Moreover, it is used for treating wind-heat cold, lung-heat asthma, swelling and pain of pharynxes and gingivae, thoracic obstruction and cardiodynia with pungent, stroke, hemiplegia, thromboangiitis obliterans, burn, scald and central retinitis. AIMS OF THE REVIEW: This paper aims to provide a critical summary of the current studies on I. pubescens. The progress in research on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of the plant is discussed. We mainly focus on the phytochemical and pharmacological investigations of I. pubescens. Furthermore, perspectives for possible future studies on I. pubescens are also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted on the studies of I. pubescens performed during the past 40 years with resources including the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and literature databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Wiley, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), SciFinder, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Baidu Scholar. RESULTS: To date, more than 200 compounds have been isolated and identified from the plant, a substantial proportion of which were reported to be triterpenes. Biological effects such as protective effects against cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, anti-thrombosis, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour activities were also investigated in in vitro and in vivo research. Therapeutic effects are attributed to the bioactivities of the naturally occurring compounds in this herb. Furthermore, toxicological studies on I. pubescens are relatively scarce, and it is worthy of further research. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes the results from current studies of I. pubescens, which is one of the valuable medicinal sources from traditional herbs. Some conventional uses have been evaluated by pharmacological investigation. In addition, unresolved issues include molecular mechanisms underlying bioactivities, pharmacokinetics, toxicology and efficacy, which are still being studied and explored before achieving integration into clinical medicines.

31885791|t|Weisheng-Tang Ameliorates Acute Ischemic Brain Damage in Mice by Maintaining Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity.
31885791|a|Stroke is one of the major causes of death and long-term disability worldwide; the associated breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) aggravates ischemic brain damage. Accordingly, many medicinal herbs and formulas have been used to treat stroke-related symptoms. In this study, we selected two Korean herbal medicine formulas, Weisheng-tang and Tongxuewan, through Dongeuibogam text-mining analysis, and evaluated their protective effect on BBB disruption and brain damage in stroke. Ischemic brain damage was induced in mice by photothrombotic cortical ischemia. The infarct volume, brain edema, neurological deficits, and motor function 24 h after ischemic injury were analyzed. We investigated BBB breakdown by measuring Evans blue extravasation in addition to endothelial cells, tight junction proteins, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) using immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. Pretreatment with Weisheng-tang significantly reduced infarct volume and edema and improved neurological and motor functions; however, Tongxuewan did not. In addition, Weisheng-tang decreased brain infarction and edema and recovered neurological and motor deficit in a dose-dependent manner (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg). Weisheng-tang pretreatment resulted in significantly less BBB damage and higher brain microvasculature after focal cerebral ischemia. Tight junction proteins, such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5, were preserved in Weisheng-tang-pretreated mice. Moreover, the ischemic brain in these mice showed suppressed PAR-1 and MMP-9 expression. In conclusion, our findings show that Weisheng-tang, which was selected through literature analysis but has not previously been used as a stroke remedy, exerts protective effects against ischemic brain damage and suggest its possible application for potential stroke patients, especially in the elderly.

31601868|t|Efficacy and safety of Sihogayonggolmoryeo-tang (Saikokaryukotsuboreito, Chai-Hu-Jia-Long-Gu-Mu-Li-Tang) for post-stroke depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
31601868|a|This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to analyze the efficacy and safety of Sihogayonggolmoryeo-tang (SGYMT), a classical herbal medicine consisting of 11 herbs, for treatment of post-stroke depression (PSD). Thirteen databases were comprehensively searched from their inception dates until July 2019. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using SGYMT as a monotherapy or adjunctive therapy for PSD patients were included. Where appropriate data were available, meta-analysis was performed and presented as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Jadad scale. The quality of evidence for each main outcome was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Twenty-one RCTs with 1,644 participants were included. In the comparison between the SGYMT and antidepressants groups, the SGYMT group scored significantly lower on both the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) (8 studies; MD -2.08, 95% CI -2.62 to -1.53, I2 = 34%) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (2 studies; MD -0.84, 95% CI -1.40 to -0.29, I2 = 19%), and significantly higher on the Barthel index (3 studies; MD 4.30, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.57, I2 = 66%). Moreover, the SGYMT group was associated with significantly fewer adverse events (6 studies; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.37, I2 = 0%) than the antidepressants group. In the subgroup analysis, SGYMT treatment consistently reduced HAMD scores within the first 8 weeks of treatment, but thereafter this difference between groups disappeared. Comparisons between SGYMT combined with antidepressants, and antidepressants alone, showed significantly lower scores in the combination group for both HAMD (7 studies; MD = -6.72, 95% CI = -11.42 to -2.01, I2 = 98%) and NIHSS scores (4 studies; MD -3.03, 95% CI -3.60 to -2.45, I2 = 87%). In the subgroup analysis, the reductions of HAMD scores in the SGYMT combined with antidepressants group were consistent within 4 weeks of treatment, but disappeared thereafter. The quality of RCTs was generally low and the quality of evidence evaluated by the GRADE approach was rated mostly "Very low" to "Moderate." The main causes of low quality ratings were the high risk of bias and imprecision of results. Current evidence suggests that SGYMT, used either as a monotherapy or an adjuvant therapy to antidepressants, might have potential benefits for the treatment of PSD, including short-term reduction of depressive symptoms, improvement of neurological symptoms, and few adverse events. However, since the methodological quality of the included studies was generally low and there were no large placebo trials to ensure reliability, it remains difficult to draw definitive conclusions on this topic. Further well-designed RCTs addressing these shortcomings are needed to confirm our results.

31255722|t|Network pharmacology study of traditional Chinese medicines for stroke treatment and effective constituents screening.
31255722|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Stroke is one of the most frequent causes of death and disability. So far there are no effective preventives or treatments. The therapeutic system of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) has been in use for several thousand years and still affords a valuable resource for today's clinicians in preserving health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We had collected the Chinese medicinal formulae and then commonly used single herbs or drug combinations were analyzed through data mining. The ingredients from the top 30 frequently used herbs which have good druggability and blood-brain barrier permeability were collected as a natural product library. Targets of the related ingredients were predicted using various databases and analyzed by GO and KEGG pathway mapping. The potential stroke targets were validated in the market or from clinical trials, and used to establish molecular docking, HipHop and SBP models to screen new compounds for multi-target activity. Lastly, in vitro experiments with models for oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGDR) were conducted to test the activities of compounds identified by screening. RESULTS: A total of 1679 Chinese medicinal formulas were selected and their prescription rules were analyzed. 4277 compounds were from the top 30 herbs and 3560 molecules were filtered to build the natural product library. The ingredient-target network, target-disease network and target-target interaction network were established to explain the characteristics and mechanisms of the TCMs. Thirty-one molecules were selected to have multi-target activity on targets of stroke via virtual screening. Five of these had already been reported to have therapeutic effects on stroke. Three of the eight compounds which have been examined showed protective effects on OGDR model. CONCLUSIONS: This paper details a novel strategy for exploring the characteristics and mechanisms of herbal medicines from a systematic standpoint in an attempt to identify those affecting specific target pathways related to stroke. Using this methodology on our natural products library, we found a number of lead candidates with multi-target activity.

31471773|t|Interactions between clopidogrel and traditional Chinese medicine.
31471773|a|The use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has obtained more and more acceptance all over the world due to its multi-target and multi-level function characteristics. Clopidogrel is a major therapeutic option to reduce atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, recent myocardial infarction, recent stroke or established peripheral arterial disease. These patients probably take TCM. Are there any interactions between clopidogrel and TCM? Whether TCM will affect the efficacy of clopidogrel or increase the adverse reactions of bleeding? Clarifying this information will help physicians make better use of TCM. A literature search was carried out using Web of Science, PubMed and the Cochrane Library to analyze the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions of clopidogrel and TCM. Some herbs can increase the AUC or Cmax of clopidogrel, such as Scutellarin, Danggui, Gegen, Sauchinone and Dengzhan Shengmai capsules. Whereas others can decrease clopidogrel, for example, Ginkgo and Danshen. Furthermore, some herbs can increase the AUC or Cmax of clopidogrel active metabolite, including Ginkgo and Xuesaitong tablet. And others can decrease the clopidogrel active metabolite, such as Scutellarin, Danshen, Fufang Danshen Dripping Pill and Dengzhan Shengmai capsules. Additionally, Schisandra chinensis, Danggui, Gegen and Fufang Danshen Dripping Pill can decrease the AUC or Cmax of the clopidogrel inactive metabolite, while Curcumin on the contrary. The pharmacodynamics of Panax notoginseng, Notoginsenoside Ft1, Hypericum perforatum, Shexiang baoxin pills, Naoxintong capsule increased the antiplatelet activity compared with clopidogrel alone, while Danshen decreased the platelet inhibition. In adverse reactions, Danggui can enhance the adverse effects of clopidogrel on the bleeding time. With more awareness and understanding on potential drug-herb interactions of clopidogrel and TCM, it may be possible to combine clopidogrel with TCM herbs to yield a better therapeutic outcome.

31771734|t|[Autophagy mechanism of cerebral ischemia injury and intervention of traditional Chinese medicine].
31771734|a|OBJECTIVE: Autophagy is a process of degrading the damaged organelles and macromolecules by lysosomes in cells, which belongs to the programmed cell death. Cerebral ischemia is one of the important reasons for activation of autophagy. Studies have showed that autophagy plays a protective role in neuronal death induced by ischemia. However, it has also been found that excessive activation of autophagy could aggravate cerebral ischemia injury. In recent years, more and more Chinese medicine has been proved to regulate the autophagy level of brain neurons and reduce cerebral ischemia injury. In this paper, the main molecular mechanism of autophagy in the process of cerebral ischemic injury and the intervention effects of Chinese herbs on autophagy arereviewed in order to explore the basic principle of regulating autophagy by Chinese herbs and to play a better role in the clinical treatment of cerebral ischemic diseases.

31514387|t|Changing Sodium Knowledge, Attitudes and Intended Behaviours Using Web-Based Dietary Assessment Tools: A Proof-Of-Concept Study.
31514387|a|Despite public health efforts to reduce dietary sodium, sodium intakes in most countries remains high. The purpose of this study was to determine if using novel web-based tools that provide tailored feedback, the Sodium Calculator and Sodium Calculator Plus, improves users' sodium-related knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviours (KAB). In this single arm pre- and post-test study, 199 healthy adults aged 18-34 years completed a validated questionnaire to assess changes to sodium-related KAB before and after using the calculators. After using the calculators, the proportion of participants who accurately identified the sodium adequate intake and chronic disease risk reduction level increased (19% to 74% and 23% to 74%, respectively, both p = 0.021). The proportion accurately self-assessing their sodium intake as 'high' also increased (41% to 66%, p = 0.021). Several intended behavioural changes were reported, i.e., buying foods with sodium-reduced labels, using the Nutrition Facts table, using spices and herbs instead of salt, and limiting eating out. Evidence-based eHealth tools that assess and provide personalized feedback on sodium intake have the potential to aid in facilitating sodium reduction in individuals. This study is an important first step in evaluating and optimizing the implementation of eHealth tools to help reduce Canadians' sodium intakes.

31807255|t|Protective effects of Vitex agnus-castus in ovariectomy mice following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion.
31807255|a|Objectives: Previous studies have indicated that phytoestrogens induce estrogenic as well as anti-inflammatory effects, and they are found in high abundance in the extracts of some herbs such as Vitex Agnus Castus (VAC). Therefore, we investigated the effect of VAC extract on ovariectomized mice after the induction of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAO) model. Materials and Methods: In this study, 50 mice ranging from 25 to 35 g were divided into five experimental groups as follows: Control, VAC, Estrogen, Tamoxifen, and Tamoxifen-VAC. Animals were ovariectomized, and after 30 days of treatment, they were given PMCAO induction. Behavioral assessment (adhesive removal and wire hanging tests) was evaluated 24 hr, 48 hr, and one week after induction of stroke. The infarct volume, as well as serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were measured one week after stroke. Results: One week after stroke, in both VAC and estrogen groups, the infarct size reduced in comparison with the control group. Estrogen and VAC extract improved adhesive removal and wire hanging test, increased the level of IL-10, and decreased the level of MMP-9 compared with the control group. In addition, co-administration of tamoxifen and VCA extract had no significant effect on measured indices compared with control and tamoxifen groups. Conclusion: Based on our findings, VAC extract has neuroprotective properties and can reduce stroke injuries in PMCAO-induced ovariectomized mice via anti-inflammatory and estrogenic properties.

31348992|t|Computational systems pharmacology reveals an antiplatelet and neuroprotective mechanism of Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection in the treatment of ischemic stroke.
31348992|a|Herbs are typically prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat complex diseases. The multicomponent nature of herbal drug ingredients makes it difficult to readily understand their mode of action. To decipher their molecular mechanisms, here we proposed a novel computational systems pharmacology based approach, which consisted of transcriptome profiling, data collection, statistical analysis, network algorithm, bioinformatics analysis and pharmacological validation. The network algorithm called signed random walk with restart (SRWR) was used to simulate the propagation of drugs' effects on networks. This algorithm could identify proteins either positively or negatively regulated (activated or inhibited) by drugs on human signaling networks. To establish proof of principle, the herbal product Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection (DZXXI), which exhibits pharmacological effects in ischemic stroke but its mechanism was unclear, was analyzed. Eighty-three targets were predicted with high confidence for DZXXI's active compounds in plasma, and 87 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in MCF7 cells treated with DZXXI. These target genes were further found to be associated with pathways involved in neuronal apoptosis in ischemic stroke, such as NF-κB signaling, TNF signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling. Intersection analysis between DZXXI's putative targets with ischemic stroke-associated genes identified two important targets (PTGS1, PTGS2) corresponding to four DZXXI compounds, which were further validated using in silico and in vitro/vivo models. The most inhibited genes identified by the SRWR algorithm were significantly enriched with ischemic stroke-associated disease genes, antiplatelet associated pathways, and their encoded proteins were enriched in brain, vascular endothelium and platelets. The CMAP analysis based on DEGs suggested that DZXXI could function as both an anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet agent. Taken together, the computational analysis suggested that DZXXI exhibited anti-platelet and neuroprotective effects in the treatment of ischemic stroke. These deductions were preliminarily confirmed by subsequent in vitro/vivo studies. This approach provides a systems perspective to study the relevance between herbal drugs and disease processes, and can reveal possible pharmacological effects of multiple ingredients within herbal product.

30411995|t|Metabolomics Study on the Effects of Salvianolic Acid B and Borneol for Treating Cerebral Ischemia in Rats by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry.
30411995|a|Salviae miltiorrliza-borneol Jun-Shi coupled-herbs have been widely used for treatment of ischemia stroke. Salvianolic acid B was the most abundant and bioactive compound of Salviae miltiorrliza and used for prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. However, the scientific intension and compatible mechanism of Salvianolic acid B - borneol combination were still unknown. A metabolomics study approach based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) combined with a pathological study has been applied to study the metabolic disturbances of cerebral ischemia and evaluate the efficacies of Sal B and Sal B/borneol against cerebral ischemia in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. The neuroprotection of Sal B and Sal B/borneol was reversed through the evaluation of neurological deficits, infarct volume, and neuronal apoptosis in MCAO model. The metabonomic analysis revealed that the MCAO-induced cerebral ischemia could be ameliorated by Sal B through improving the energy metabolism, lipids metabolism, inflammatory responses, and oxidant stress. Borneol could enhance the neuroprotective effects, was associated with the increased concentration of Sal B, and attenuate the function of sphingolipid metabolism pathway in cerebral ischemia rats. These findings perhaps clarify the mechanism of neuroprotective effects of treating ischemia stroke by Sal B or Sal B/borneol preliminarily through metabolomics and push the quality promotion and the composition of borneol/Sal B in secondary development of prescription.

31075951|t|American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolium L.) as a Source of Bioactive Phytochemicals with Pro-Health Properties.
31075951|a|Panax quinquefolium L. (American Ginseng, AG) is an herb characteristic for regions of North America and Asia. Due to its beneficial properties it has been extensively investigated for decades. Nowadays, it is one of the most commonly applied medical herbs worldwide. Active compounds of AG are ginsenosides, saponins of the glycosides group that are abundant in roots, leaves, stem, and fruits of the plant. Ginsenosides are suggested to be primarily responsible for health-beneficial effects of AG. AG acts on the nervous system; it was reported to improve the cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, display anxiolytic activity, and neuroprotective effects against neuronal damage resulting from ischemic stroke in animals, demonstrate anxiolytic activity, and induce neuroprotective effects against neuronal damage in ischemic stroke in animals. Administration of AG leads to inhibition of hypertrophy in heart failure by regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mice as well as depletion of cardiac contractile function in rats. It also has an anti-diabetic and anti-obesity potential as it increases insulin sensitivity and inhibits formation of adipose tissue. AG displays anti-cancer effect by induction of apoptosis of cancer cells and reducing local inflammation. It exerts antimicrobial effects against several pathogenic strains of bacteria. Therefore, AG presents a high potential to induce beneficial health effects in humans and should be further explored to formulate precise nutritional recommendations, as well as to assess its value in prevention and therapy of some disorders, including cancer.

31102958|t|Flavonoids in hypertension: a brief review of the underlying mechanisms.
31102958|a|Flavonoids are a diverse group of bioactive polyphenolic compounds abundant in dietary plants and herbs. Regular consumption of flavonoids exerts cardio-vasculoprotective effects and may reduce the onset or progression of many cardiovascular diseases, particularly hypertension. Observational studies suggest inverse associations among either of these three combinations: a) anthocyanin intake and risk of myocardial infarction (MI), b) flavanone intake and risk of ischemic stroke and c) flavonol intake and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that catechins and quercetin impart significant blood pressure lowering effects. Mechanistically, flavonoids mediate their antihypertensive effects through increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, reducing endothelial cell oxidative stress or modulating vascular ion channel activity. In this review, we focus on the six main subgroups of flavonoids, namely flavones, flavonols, flavanols, flavanones, anthocyanins, and isoflavones. We further discuss their antihypertensive effects, and their possible mechanisms of regulating blood pressure. We conclude by addressing the safety of these compounds as well as their potential use in hypertension management and treatment.

30496589|t|Effects of red yeast rice prescription (LipoCol Forte) on adverse outcomes of surgery.
30496589|a|BACKGROUND: The influence of red yeast rice (RYR) on perioperative outcome remains unknown. AIM: We aimed to compare the complications and mortality after surgery between patients treated with and without RYR prescription. DESIGN: In this surgical cohort study of 3.6 million surgical patients who underwent major inpatient surgeries, 2581 patients who used RYR prescription pre-operatively were compared with 25 810 non-RYR patients selected by matching for age and sex. METHODS: Patients' demographics and medical conditions were collected from the claims data of the National Health Insurance in Taiwan. Complications and mortality after major surgeries in association with RYR prescription were investigated by calculating adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Compared with patients without RYR prescription, patients prescribed RYR had lower risks of post-operative bleeding (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.89), pneumonia (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.83), stroke (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.92) and 30-day in-hospital mortality (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15-0.92). Decreased risk of intensive care (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.77), shorter length of hospital stay (P < 0.001) and lower medical expenditures (P = 0.0008) during the index surgical admission were also noted for patients with RYR prescription compared to those for patients without RYR prescription. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a potentially positive effect of RYR on outcomes after major surgeries. However, patient non-compliance for taking medication should be noted. Our findings require future prospective studies to validate RYR prescription for improving perioperative outcomes.

30930774|t|Anti-inflammatory Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicines on Preclinical in vivo Models of Brain Ischemia-Reperfusion-Injury: Prospects for Neuroprotective Drug Discovery and Therapy.
30930774|a|Acquired brain ischemia-and reperfusion-injury (IRI), including both Ischemic stroke (IS) and Traumatic Brain injury (TBI), is one of the most common causes of disability and death in adults and represents a major burden in both western and developing countries worldwide. China's clinical neurological therapeutic experience in the use of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), including TCM-derived active compounds, Chinese herbs, TCM formulations and decoction, in brain IRI diseases indicated a trend of significant improvement in patients' neurological deficits, calling for blind, placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trials with careful meta-analysis evaluation. There are many TCMs in use for brain IRI therapy in China with significant therapeutic effects in preclinical studies using different brain IRI-animal. The basic hypothesis in this field claims that in order to avoid the toxicity and side effects of the complex TCM formulas, individual isolated and identified compounds that exhibited neuroprotective properties could be used as lead compounds for the development of novel drugs. China's efforts in promoting TCMs have contributed to an explosive growth of the preclinical research dedicated to the isolation and identification of TCM-derived neuroprotective lead compounds. Tanshinone, is a typical example of TCM-derived lead compounds conferring neuroprotection toward IRI in animals with brain middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or TBI models. Recent reports show the significance of the inflammatory response accompanying brain IRI. This response appears to contribute to both primary and secondary ischemic pathology, and therefore anti-inflammatory strategies have become popular by targeting pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, other inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and several transcriptional factors. Here, we review recent selected studies and discuss further considerations for critical reevaluation of the neuroprotection hypothesis of TCMs in IRI therapy. Moreover, we will emphasize several TCM's mechanisms of action and attempt to address the most promising compounds and the obstacles to be overcome before they will enter the clinic for IRI therapy. We hope that this review will further help in investigations of neuroprotective effects of novel molecular entities isolated from Chinese herbal medicines and will stimulate performance of clinical trials of Chinese herbal medicine-derived drugs in IRI patients.

30687085|t|Antiplatelet and Antithrombotic Activity of a Traditional Medicine, Hwangryunhaedok-Tang.
30687085|a|Platelet activation and accumulation at the site of vascular injury are central to thrombus formation resulted in thrombotic disorders. Medicinal herbs could be one of the most important pharmaceutical agents that ameliorate thrombotic disorders, such as unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular diseases. Hwangryunhaedok-tang (HRT) is a traditional herbal medicine that displays multiple biological properties including anti-inflammatory abilities. However, its role in platelet activation has not been fully studied. Hence, we examined whether HRT has a potent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. We demonstrated that HRT (30, 50, and 100 μg/ml) significantly impaired thrombin- and collagen-related peptide-induced platelet aggregation, granule secretion, thromboxane B2 generation, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Biochemical studies revealed that HRT is involved in inhibiting the phosphorylation of phospholipase C and protein kinase B. The oral administration of HRT (30, 50, and 100 mg/kg once daily for 1 and/or 7 days) efficiently ameliorates ferric chloride induced arterial thrombus formation in vivo. Tail bleeding time was not significantly increased. The qualitative phytochemical constituents of the HRT extract were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography. Our results demonstrated that HRT shows potential antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects without affecting hemostasis. Hence, HRT could be an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of thrombotic diseases.

30719065|t|A Review of Antiplatelet Activity of Traditional Medicinal Herbs on Integrative Medicine Studies.
30719065|a|Thrombotic events mainly occurred by platelet activation and aggregation. The vascular occlusion causes serious disease states such as unstable angina, ischemic stroke, and heart attack. Due to the pervading of thrombotic diseases, new antiplatelet drugs are necessary for preventing and treating arterial thrombosis without adverse side effects. Traditional medicinal herbs have been used for the treatment of human ailments for a long time. The clinically useful and safe products from traditional medicinal herbs were identified and developed in numerous pharmacological approaches. A complementary system of traditional medicinal herbs is a good candidate for pharmacotherapy. However, it still has a limitation in its function and efficacy. Thus, it is necessary to study the mode of action of traditional medicinal herbs as alternative therapeutic agents. In this review, we focused on our current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of traditional medicinal herbs in antiplatelet activity and antithrombotic effect of traditional medicinal herbs on platelet function.

31777018|t|Preventive and Therapeutic Effect of Ganoderma (Lingzhi) on Brain Injury.
31777018|a|Neurological dysfunction and death are common events leading to acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease account for a significant and increasing proportion of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum, Lingzhi), one of highly nutritious and significantly effective medicinal herbs, has been used for clinical applications for thousands of years. Several researches have shown that it has a wide range of brain damage protection, such as amelioration of Alzheimer's disease, therapeutic effect on epilepsy, and the protective effect on neural cells in stroke injury. This chapter reviews the neuroprotective effects of G. lucidum and its extracts on brain injury diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, and other neurodegenerative diseases, and the potential clinical applications.

31264546|t|Natural Products from Mediterranean Diet: From Anti-hyperlipidemic Agents to Dietary Epigenetic Modulators.
31264546|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are, currently, the major contributor to global mortality and will continue to dominate mortality rates in the future. Hyperlipidemia refers to the elevated levels of lipids and cholesterol in the blood, and is also identified as dyslipidemia, manifesting in the form of different disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. These abnormalities may lead to the development of atherosclerosis, which can lead to coronary artery disease and stroke. In recent years, there is a growing interest in the quest for alternative therapeutic treatments based on natural products, offering better recovery and the avoidance of side effects. Recent technological advances have further improved our understanding of the role of epigenetic mechanisms in hyperlipidemic disorders and dietary prevention strategies. OBJECTIVE: This is a comprehensive overview of the anti-hyperlipidemic effects of plant extracts, vegetables, fruits and isolated compounds thereof, with a focus on natural products from the Mediterranean region as well as the possible epigenetic changes in gene expression or cardiometabolic signaling pathways. METHODS: For the purpose of this study, we searched the PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases for eligible articles and publications over the last five years. The keywords included: "hyperlipidemia", "plant extract", "herbs", "natural products", "vegetables", "cholesterol" and others. We initially included all relevant articles referring to in vitro studies, animal studies, Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and previous reviews. CONCLUSION: Many natural products found in the Mediterranean diet have been studied for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The antihyperlipidemic effect seems to be dose and/or consumption frequency related, which highlights the fact that a healthy diet can only be effective in reversing disease markers if it is consistent and within the framework of a healthy lifestyle. Finally, epigenetic biomarkers are increasingly recognized as new lifestyle management tools to monitor a healthy dietary lifestyle for the prevention of hyperlipidaemic disorders and comorbidities to promote a healthy life.

30573993|t|The effects of Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang on post-stroke epilepsy: a nationwide matched study.
30573993|a|Objective: To compare the long-term risk of epilepsy in stroke patients who use Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang (BYHWT) and those who do not. Methods: In the Taiwanese national insurance claims data, we identified newly diagnosed stroke patients receiving inpatient care in the years 2000-2004. Using propensity score-matched pairs to balance the baseline characteristics, we selected eligible stroke patients who did (n=8,971) and did not (n=8,971) receive BYHWT. These two groups were followed up until the end of 2009 to track the occurrence of epilepsy. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate the adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for post-stroke epilepsy during the follow-up period according to BYHWT use. Results: Compared with the control group, stroke patients with BYHWT had a reduced risk of epilepsy during the 5-9 years of the follow-up period (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.61-0.77). The association between BYHWT and reduced post-stroke epilepsy was significant in various subgroups of stroke patients. There was a dose-dependent decrease in the frequency of epilepsy with increasing quantities of BYHWT use from 1 package (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.90) to ≥6 packages (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.42-0.65). Conclusion: Stroke patients who received BYHWT therapy had a reduced long-term risk of epilepsy, and the beneficial effect could be observed in various subgroups. However, future clinical trials will be necessary to corroborate the present findings and identify the biochemical mechanism involved.

29782526|t|Decreased risk of pneumonia in stroke patients receiving acupuncture: A nationwide matched-pair retrospective cohort study.
29782526|a|BACKGROUND: Acupuncture treatment is common among stroke patients, but there is limited information available on whether acupuncture effectively prevents post-stroke pneumonia. The aim of this study was to analyze the differential risk of pneumonia after stroke between patients who did and did not receive acupuncture after discharge. METHODS: We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a retrospective cohort study using propensity score matched-pairs of new stroke patients in 2000-2004 who did and did not receive acupuncture post-stroke. Both cohorts were followed up until the end of 2009 for new-onset pneumonia. After correcting for immortal time bias, the incidence and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of pneumonia associated with acupuncture use were calculated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Overall, 12557 stroke patients with 12557 paired controls were included in the analysis; pneumonia was diagnosed in 6796 (27.1%). Stroke patients receiving acupuncture had a lower incidence of pneumonia than those without acupuncture (53.4 vs. 58.9 per 1000 person-years), with an adjusted HR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.90). The association between pneumonia risk and acupuncture use was significant in men (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.98) and women (HR 0.79, 95% 0.70-0.82) and was also observed in every age group from 20-79 years. CONCLUSION: Stroke patients receiving acupuncture had a lower risk of pneumonia than those who did not. Further randomized control studies are needed to validate the protective effect of acupuncture on the risk of pneumonia among stroke patients.

29933662|t|[Study progress on chemical compounds, pharmacological action and clinical application of Naoxintong capsule].
29933662|a|Naoxintong capsule (NXTC) is an oral Chinese preparation produced by modern technology, derived from the classic preparation of Buyang Huanwu decoction which was recorded by WANG Qing-ren (Qing dynasty) in Yilingaicuo Juanxia Tanweilun. NXTC is composed of 16 herbs including insect herbs and some blood circulation herbs, with the effects of supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation, dispersing blood stasis and dredging collaterals. In clinical application, it is mainly used for stroke, cerebral infarction, vascular dementia, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, transient ischemic attack, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, chronic complications of diabetes, essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia and other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and has achieved good therapeutic effect on above diseases or their concurrent diseases. Its clinical efficacy is mainly achieved through the improvement in related links of brain protection, neuroprotection, cardioprotection, hemorheology, et al. Nearly 200 chemical constituents identified in NXTC are important pharmacological basis for its functions. At present, however, most of its pharmacological basic researches are focused on plant herbs, and the three kinds of insect herbs remain to be further studied. The researches on clinical effectiveness are more comprehensive; the safety study of long-term application in real world is ongoing by our team, and its results are yet to be published after finishing the study. Through the systematic and comprehensive combing and elaboration of the research progresses on the chemical compositions, pharmacological action and clinical application of NXTC, it can provide a reference for the in-depth study of this preparation, with a great significance for the quality control, secondary development and internationalization promotion of NXTC.

29615027|t|Comparative efficacy of Chinese herbal injections for treating acute cerebral infarction: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
29615027|a|BACKGROUND: Chinese herbal injections (CHIs) are prepared by extracting and purifying effective substances from herbs (or decoction pieces) using modern scientific techniques and methods. CHIs combined with aspirin + anticoagulants + dehydrant + neuroprotectant (AADN) are believed to be effective for the treatment of acute cerebral infarction (ACI). However, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been performed to directly compare the efficacies of different regimens of CHIs. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the efficacies of different regimens of CHIs for ACI. METHODS: We conducted an overall and systematic retrieval from literature databases of RCTs focused on the use of CHIs to treat ACI up to June 2016. We used the Cochrane Handbook version 5.1.0 and CONSORT statement to assess the risk of bias. The data were analyzed using STATA 13.0 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 software. RESULTS: Overall, 64 studies with 6225 participants involving 15 CHIs were included in the NMA. In terms of the markedly effective rate, Danhong (DH) + AADN had the highest likelihood of being the best treatment. In terms of the improvement of neurological impairment, Shuxuening (SXN) + AADN had the highest likelihood of being the best treatment. Considering two outcomes, injections of SXN, Yinxingdamo (YXDM), DH, Shuxuetong (SXT), HongHuaHuangSeSu (HHHSS), DengZhanXiXin (DZXX) and Shenxiong glucose (SX) plus AADN were the optimum treatment regimens for ACI, especially SXN + AADN and YXDM + AADN. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the NMA, SXN, YXDM, DH, SXT, HHHSS, DZXX and SX plus AADN showed the highest probability of being the best treatment regimens. Due to the limitations of the present study, our findings should be verified by well-designed RCTs.

29696521|t|Herbal Medicine in Ischemic Stroke: Challenges and Prospective.
29696521|a|Herbal medicines, mainly of plant source, are invaluable source for the discovery of new therapeutic agents for all sorts of human ailments. The complex pathogenesis of stroke and multifactorial effect of herbal medicine and their active constituents may suggest the promising future of natural medicine for stroke treatment. Anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, neuroprotective and vascular protective effect of herbal medicines are believed to be efficacious in stroke treatment. Herbs typically have fewer reported side effects than allopathic medicine, and may be safer to use over longer period of time. Herbal medicines are believed to be more effective for the longstanding health complaints, such as stroke. Several medicinal plants and their active constituents show the promising results in laboratory research. However failure in transformation of laboratory animal research to the clinical trials has created huge challenge for the use of herbal medicine in stroke. Until and unless scientifically comprehensive evidence of the efficacy and safety of herbal medicine in ischemic stroke patients is available, efforts should be made to continue implementing treatment strategies of proven effectiveness. More consideration should be paid to natural compounds that can have extensive therapeutic time windows, perfect pharmacological targets with few side effects. Herbal medicine has excellent prospective for the treatment of ischemic stroke, but a lot of effort should be invested to transform the success of animal research to human use.

29728025|t|[Explore compatibility mechanism of Xingnaojing injection in treating cerebral infarction based on network pharmacology].
29728025|a|This paper aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of Xingnaojing injection and its scientific connotation of compatibility mechanism from a new perspective on bioinformatics and network biology. Based on the analysis function of intergrative pharmacology platform V1.0, the compatibility mechanism of this prescription was investigated by constructing the herbs-compounds-targets network. Seven hundreds and ninety-five targets from the prescription were screened out, then 302 hub nodes were included in drug targets-disease targets network. Enrichment analysis showed that it was related to MAPK cascade, negative/positive regulation of apoptotic process and other biological functions as well as PI3K/AKT, neurotrophin and other signal pathways. The target functions of different drugs were similar, complementing each other, and belonging to the common signaling pathway with asynergistic effect. Based on analysis of core components-key targets-main pathway network, among totally 25 core components and 29 key targets, musk had 15 and 25 respectively.SLC1A2, AR, PGR, CAT, NMDA receptors and other targets were associated with cerebral infarction. Musk, gardenia and borneol compatibility can play a bidirectional regulation of apoptosis; musk and gardenia showed synergistic effect on Ras signaling pathway, indicating that musk was the main ingredient of the injection and the other three drugs played the role of assistance. This study could not only provide the bioinformatics support in compatibility mechanism of Xingnaojing injection, but also provide theoretical support for its formula rationality.

29498696|t|Synergistic Effects of Salvianolic Acid B and Puerarin on Cerebral Ischemia Reperfusion Injury.
29498696|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) is characterized by the sudden loss of blood circulation to an area of the brain, resulting in a corresponding loss of neurologic function. It has been a worldwide critical disease threatening to the health and life of human beings. Despite significant progresses achieved, effective treatment still remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the disease. Salvianolic acid B (Sal-B) and Puerarin (Pue) are two active neuroprotectants isolated from traditional Chinese herbs, Salvia miltiorrhiza and Kudzu root respectively, which have been used for the prevention and treatment of IS for thousands of years in China. The activities of two compounds against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury have been confirmed via various pathways. However, the therapeutic efficacy of any of the two components is still unsatisfied. In the present study, the effect of the combination of Sal-B and Pue on IS was evaluated and validated in vitro and in vivo. The ratio of two compounds was firstly optimized based on the results of CoCl₂ damaged PC12 cells model. The co-administration exhibited significantly protective effect in CoCl₂ induced PC12 cells injury model by reducing ROS, inhibiting apoptosis and improving mitochondrial membrane potential in vitro. Moreover, Sal-B + Pue significantly relieved neurological deficit scores and infarct area than Sal-B or Pue alone in vivo. The results indicated that neuroprotection mechanism of Sal-B + Pue was related to TLR4/MyD88 and SIRT1 activation signaling pathway to achieve synergistic effect, due to the inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6). In conclusion, the combination of Sal-B and Pue exerted much stronger neuroprotective effect than Sal-B or Pue alone, which provides a potential new drug and has great significance for the treatment of IS.

29480368|t|The Global Epidemic of the Metabolic Syndrome.
29480368|a|Metabolic syndrome, variously known also as syndrome X, insulin resistance, etc., is defined by WHO as a pathologic condition characterized by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Though there is some variation in the definition by other health care organization, the differences are minor. With the successful conquest of communicable infectious diseases in most of the world, this new non-communicable disease (NCD) has become the major health hazard of modern world. Though it started in the Western world, with the spread of the Western lifestyle across the globe, it has become now a truly global problem. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries than in its Western counterparts. The two basic forces spreading this malady are the increase in consumption of high calorie-low fiber fast food and the decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities. The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities. The total cost of the malady including the cost of health care and loss of potential economic activity is in trillions. The present trend is not sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal efforts are made to change the lifestyle that is promoting it. There are certainly some elements in the causation of the metabolic syndrome that cannot be changed but many are amenable for corrections and curtailments. For example, better urban planning to encourage active lifestyle, subsidizing consumption of whole grains and possible taxing high calorie snacks, restricting media advertisement of unhealthy food, etc. Revitalizing old fashion healthier lifestyle, promoting old-fashioned foods using healthy herbs rather than oil and sugar, and educating people about choosing healthy/wholesome food over junks are among the steps that can be considered.

29599893|t|Pretreatment with Shuanghe-Tang Extract Attenuates Postischemic Brain Injury and Edema in a Mouse Model of Stroke: An Analysis of Medicinal Herbs Listed in Dongui Bogam.
29599893|a|Aim: Although stroke is among the leading causes of death and long-term disability, there are few effective treatments for limiting the severity of neurological sequelae. We evaluated the effects of 29 medicinal herbs listed in the Pung chapter of the 17th century Korean medical text Dongui Bogam on stroke symptoms in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia. Methods: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced via photothrombosis. Infarct volume, brain edema, and neurological deficits were evaluated. Immunofluorescence staining for tight junction proteins and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) was performed following ischemic injury. Results: Based on our initial findings, we examined the effects of two prescriptions in which the candidate herbs comprised more than 60% of the total formula: Shuanghe-tang and Zengsunsiwu-tang. Pretreatment with Shuanghe-tang significantly reduced infarct volume, decreased blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, attenuated edema, and improved neurological and motor functions in a dose-dependent manner (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg), while no such effects were observed in mice pretreated with Zengsunsiwu-tang. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant increases in ipsilateral occludin and zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) expression in Shuanghe-tang-pretreated mice, as well as increased AQP4 immunofluorescence. Conclusions: These results indicate that Shuanghe-tang may protect against brain injury and promote recovery of neurological function following ischemia.

29599812|t|Study of Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Bojungikki-Tang with Aspirin in Healthy Subjects and Ischemic Stroke Patients.
29599812|a|Background: Bojungikki-tang (BJIKT) is a widely used traditional herbal formula in China, Japan, and Korea. There have been reports that several herbs among BJIKT have interactions with antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin. This study aimed to assess whether BJIKT interacts with aspirin in terms of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients. Methods: The phase I interaction trial was a randomized, open-label, crossover study of 10 healthy male subjects, and the phase III interaction trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study of 43 ischemic stroke patients. Each participant randomly received aspirin + BJIKT or aspirin + placebo. For PK analysis, plasma acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) and salicylic acid (SA) were evaluated, and, for PD analysis, platelet aggregation and plasma thromboxane B2 (TxB2) were measured. Results: In the PK parameters, mean area under curve, maximum concertation, and peak concentration time of ASA and SA were not different between two groups in healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients. In the PD profiles, TxB2 concentrations and platelet aggregation were not affected by coadministration of BJIKT in healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients. Conclusions: These results suggest that coadministration of BJIKT with aspirin may not result in herb-drug interaction.

29329323|t|Stroke risk and outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease: Two nationwide studies.
29329323|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Because the risk and outcomes of stroke in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were unclear, we evaluated these risks using a retrospective cohort study and a nested cohort study. METHODS: We used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 1378 patients aged ≥20 years who had ESRD in 2000-2004. An age- and sex-matched CKD cohort (n = 5512) and a control cohort (n = 11,024) were selected for comparison. Events of incident stroke were considered as outcome during the follow-up period in 2000-2013, and we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs of stroke associated with CKD or ESRD. We further used matching procedure with propensity score to estimate the risk of stroke for control group, CKD patients, and EDRD patients. A nested cohort study of 318,638 hospitalized stroke patients between 2000 and 2010 also was conducted to analyze the impact of CKD and ESRD on post-stroke mortality. RESULTS: Before propensity-score matching, the incidences of stroke for controls, CKD patients and ESRD patients were 6.57, 13.3, and 21.7 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Compared with control group, the adjusted HRs of stroke were 1.49 (95% CI, 1.32-1.68) and 2.39 (95% CI, 1.39-2.87) for people with CKD or ESRD respectively, and were significantly higher in both sexes and every age group. After propensity-score matching, the HRs of stroke for patients with CKD and ESRD were 1.51 (95% CI 1.24-1.85) and 2.08 (95% CI 1.32-3.26), respectively, during the follow-up period. Among hospitalized stroke patients, adjusted rate ratio (RR) of post-stroke mortality in CKD and ESRD cohorts were 1.44 (95% CI, 1.33-1.56) and 2.62 (95% CI, 2.43-2.82) respectively compared with control. CONCLUSIONS: CKD and ESRD patient groups thus faced significantly higher risk of stroke and post-stroke mortality. Risk factor identification and preventive strategies are needed to minimize stroke risk and post-stroke mortality in these vulnerable patient groups.

In this context, naturally occurring plants and herbs with medicinal functionalities have gained special place than ever before in the current medicinal world. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to extend the current knowledge in the clinical field related to the diabetic complications. A special focus has also been given to the anti-diabetic potentialities of ethnomedicinal plants. METHOD: Herein, we reviewed and compiled salient information from the authentic bibliographic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier, Springer, Bentham Science and other scientific databases. The patents were searched and reviewed from http://www.freepatentsonline.com. RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders associated with the endocrine system that resulted in hyperglycemic conditions. Metabolic disorders can cause many complications such as neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and microangiopathy. Traditional botanical therapies have been used around the world to treat diabetes. Among several medications and different medicines, various herbs are known to cure and control diabetes; also have no side effects. History has shown that medicinal plants have long been used for traditional healing around the world to treat diabetes. More than 800 plants around the world are shown by ethnobotanical information as traditional remedies for the treatment of diabetes. Several parts of these plants have been evaluated and appreciated for hypoglycemic activity. Medicinal plants have been found to be more effective than conventional drug compounds with no/fewer side effects and relatively inexpensive. In this review paper, we have reviewed plants with anti-diabetic and related beneficial medicinal effects. CONCLUSION: This review may be helpful for researchers, diabetic patient and decision makers in the field of ethnobotanical sciences. These efforts may also provide treatment to everyone and focus on the role of traditional novel medicine plants that have anti-diabetic abilities.

28983597|t|Mediating macrophage immunity with wogonin in mice with vascular inflammation.
28983597|a|Vascular inflammation may induce a number of diseases, including organ damage or failure, heart attack and stroke. The present study aimed to investigate the use of wogonin, a compound extracted from herbs, to mediate inflammatory reactions in vascular inflammation. Wogonin was loaded in a well‑characterized polymeric biomaterial carrier. In mice with streptozotocin‑induced vascular inflammation, wogonin treatment regulated the production of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin‑6, tumor necrosis factor‑α and granulocyte macrophage colony‑stimulating factor. To understand the impact of wogonin on major immune cells, macrophages were treated with wogonin in vitro. It was determined that wogonin did not affect macrophage viability, and that wogonin regulated the relative ratio of M1 versus M2 macrophages. In addition, in co‑culture, wogonin decreased inflammatory cytokine production and regulated the activation of macrophage surface markers including CD80, CD86 and CD40. Results from the present study may aid in our understanding of the effects of wogonin in regulating inflammation, especially its effects on macrophages.

28663053|t|Protective effect of electroacupuncture on neurons autophagy in perfusion period of cerebral ischemia.
28663053|a|Electroacupuncture (EA) is an important treatment method in Chinese traditional medicine. The main purpose of the investigation was to explore whether EA could improve cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) via neurons' autophagy. 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) was applied to establish cerebral ischemia model and reperfusion 12h, 24h and 48h respectively were conduct 3h later. TTC staining was applied to assess cerebral infarction area and the concentrations of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, SOD and MDA were detected by commercial kits. The expressions of autophagy-related protein LC3, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Beclin1 were measured by Western blot. EA treatment was given at "BaiHui", "MingMen" and "ZuSanLiXue". The obtained results from TTC showed that the severity of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion was improved with EA treatment. Oxidative and inflammatory damages were also alleviated with EA intervention. Meanwhile, western blot analysis revealed the decreased levels of LC3 and Beclin1 in EA rats, as well as the elevated level of mTOR. Besides, our previous study found that EA can enhance mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity, reduce mitochondrial damage and inhibit neuronal apoptosis further. Thus, it is assumed that 4-VO-induced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion might be alleviated by EA through inhibiting neurons' excessive autophagy in reperfusion period.

28864784|t|SH003 reverses drug resistance by blocking signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in breast cancer cells.
28864784|a|Overcoming drug resistance is an important task for investigators and clinician to achieve successful chemotherapy in cancer patients. Drug resistance is caused by various factors, including the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1). The development of new, useful compounds that overcome drug resistance is urgent. SH003 is extracted from the mixture of three different herbs, and its anticancer effect has been revealed in different cancer cell types. In the present study, we investigated whether SH003 is able to reverse drug resistance using paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/PAC). In our experiments, SH003 significantly decreased cell growth and colony formation in MCF-7/PAC cells and parental MCF-7 cells. This growth inhibition was related to the accumulation of cells in the sub-G0/G1 apoptotic population and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells. SH003 reduced the mRNA expression of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) in MCF-7/PAC cells. SH003 also down-regulated the expression of P-gp. SH003 reversed drug efflux from MCF-7/PAC cells, resulting in rhodamine123 (Rho123) accumulation. Inhibition of drug resistance by SH003 is related to the suppression of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. SH003 decreased STAT3 activation (p-STAT3) and its nuclear translocation and inhibited the secretion of VEGF and MMP-2, which are STAT3 target genes. An STAT3 inhibitor, JAK inhibitor I and an HIF-1α inhibitor decreased cell growth in MCF-7 and MCF-7/PAC cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SH003 can overcome drug resistance, and SH003 might be helpful for chemotherapy in cancer patients.

28551771|t|Synergistic effects of Chuanxiong-Chishao herb-pair on promoting angiogenesis at network pharmacological and pharmacodynamic levels.
28551771|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the synergistic effects of Chuanxiong-Chishao herb-pair (CCHP) on promoting angiogenesis in silico and in vivo. METHODS: The mechanisms of action of an herb-pair, Chuanxiong-Chishao, were investigated using the network pharmacological and pharmacodynamic strategies involving computational drug target prediction and network analysis, and experimental validation. A set of network pharmacology methods were created to study the herbs in the context of targets and diseases networks, including prediction of target profiles and pharmacological actions of main active compounds in Chuanxiong and Chishao. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects and putative molecular mechanisms of Chuanxiong-Chishao actions were experimentally validated in a chemical-induced vascular insuffificiency model of transgenic zebrafifish in vivo. The mRNA expression of the predicted targets were further analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The computational prediction results found that the compounds in Chuanxiong have antithrombotic, antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic, and antiatherosclerotic activities, which were closely related to protecting against hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure. In addition, compounds in Chishao were found to participate in anti-inflflammatory effect and analgesics. Particularly, estrogen receptor α (ESRα) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α) were the most important potential protein targets in the predicted results. In vivo experimental validation showed that post-treatment of tetramethylpyrazine hydrochloride (TMP•HCl) and paeoniflorin (PF) promoted the regeneration of new blood vessels in zebrafifish involving up-regulating ESRα mRNA expression. Co-treatment of TMP•HCl and PF could enhance the vessel sprouting in chemical-induced vascular insuffificiency zebrafifish at the optimal compatibility proportion of PF 10 μmol/L with TMP•HCl 1 μmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: The network pharmacological strategies combining drug target prediction and network analysis identified some putative targets of CCHP. Moreover, the transgenic zebrafifish experiments demonstrated that the Chuanxiong-Chishao combination synergistically promoted angiogenic activity, probably involving ESRα signaling pathway.

28679673|t|Risk of dementia in patients with non-haemorrhagic stroke receiving acupuncture treatment: a nationwide matched cohort study from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.
28679673|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of dementia in patients with stroke who did and did not receive acupuncture treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: This study was based on Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database that included patients with stroke hospitalised between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2004. PARTICIPANTS: We identified 11 220 patients aged 50 years and older with newly diagnosed stroke hospitalisation. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared the incident dementia during the follow-up period until the end of 2009 in patients with stroke who did and did not receive acupuncture. The adjusted HRs and 95% CIs of dementia associated with acupuncture were calculated in multivariate Cox proportional hazard regressions. RESULTS: Acupuncture treatment was associated with a decreased risk of dementia with multivariate adjustment (HR, 0.73; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.80), and the association was significant in both sexes and every age group, as well as in groups with ischaemic stroke, with fewer medical conditions and those hospitalised after stroke. Patients with stroke received acupuncture treatment, and conventional rehabilitation was associated with a significantly reduced risk of poststroke dementia (HR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: This study raises the possibility that patients with non-haemorrhagic stroke who received acupuncture had a reduced risk of dementia. The results suggest the need for prospective sham-controlled and randomised trials to establish the efficacy of acupuncture in preventing dementia.

28509626|t|Custom-compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: why so popular despite potential harm? The case against routine use.
28509626|a|Wide rejection of conventional hormone therapy (HT) after the initial publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) led to unjustified use of custom-compounded bioidentical hormones. In the USA, it became an unregulated drug manufacturer industry in disguise, without proper control and making false claims and misleading advertisements. Manufacturing quality is not ensured. Unspecific harm from compounding has occurred on a large scale, such as deaths from infected products and end-stage renal failure plus carcinoma due to confusion between different Chinese herbs. Oral estrogens increase venous thromboembolic and ischemic stroke events, even more when overdosed; these excess risks can be avoided by non-oral administration, readily accessible in custom-compounded HT by administering estradiol through diverse routes (of which transdermal is the best documented). Another risk specific to custom-compounded HT, resulting from estrogen/progestogen imbalance, might be excess endometrial carcinomas. HT can be optimized by continuously combining transdermal estradiol with progesterone (when required). Registered preparations do exist for such a more physiological treatment and therefore must be preferred. Custom compounding is only seldom legitimate, for example in case of allergy (such as to peanut oil) or to prescribe different combinations, doses or components (e.g. estriol, dehydroepiandrosterone or testosterone), even when not approved by local regulatory authorities despite being scientifically acceptable.

28656094|t|Berberine protects against glutamate-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 and N2a cells.
28656094|a|OBJECTIVES: Neurodegenerative diseases have been associated with glutamatergic dysfunction. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid broadly present in different medicinal herbs, has been reported to have neuroprotective effect. In the present study, the effects of berberine against glutamate-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cultured PC12 and N2a cells were pretreated (2 hr) with varying concentrations of berberine (50-1000 µM), followed by exposure to glutamate (10 mM) for 24 hr. The cells viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, DNA fragmentation and the expressions of pro-apoptotic (cleaved caspase-3 and bax) and anti-apoptotic (bcl-2) proteins were then measured. RESULTS: In both cell lines, pretreatment with berberine (especially at low concentrations) significantly decreased ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation, while improving glutathione content and SOD activity in glutamate-injured cells. Moreover, berberine showed anti-apoptotic effects by reducing the glutamate-evoked caspase-3 and bax/bcl-2 overexpression. CONCLUSION: The results of present study suggest that berberine protects against glutamate-induced PC12 and N2a cells injury by decreasing oxidative stress and subsequently inhibiting apoptosis. This is relevant to berberine treatment in neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia (Alzheimer's disease), seizures, and stroke.

28217983|t|Extraction and separation of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors from Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf based on a hyphenated technique and in vitro methods.
28217983|a|Stroke is one of the most common diseases worldwide. Lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of ischemic stroke, with natural products considered a promising source of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors. In this study, ultrafiltration liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used for the screening and identification of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors from Poria cocos. Five lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors were selected: dehydropachymic acid, pachymic acid, dehydrotrametenolic acid, trametenolic acid, and eburicoic acid. The inhibitors were extracted and isolated with purities of 96.75, 98.15, 97.25, 95.46, and 94.88%, respectively, by using a new "hyphenated" strategy of microwave-assisted extraction coupled with counter-current chromatography and centrifugal partition chromatography by a two-phase solvent system of n-hexane/ethyl acetate/ethanol/water at the volume ratio 0.965:1.000:0.936:0.826 v/v/v/v. The bioactivity of the isolated compounds was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay in PC12 cells. The results also showed that the hyphenated technique of microwave-assisted extraction coupled with counter-current chromatography and centrifugal partition chromatography was an efficient method for the continuous extraction and online isolation of chemical constituents from medicinal herbs. Furthermore, the research route based on the activity screening, extraction, separation, and activity verification of the compounds offered advantages of efficiency, orientation, and objectivity.

28030360|t|Effect of natural products on diabetes associated neurological disorders.
28030360|a|Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder, is associated with neurological complications such as depression, anxiety, hypolocomotion, cognitive dysfunction, phobias, anorexia, stroke, pain, etc. Traditional system of medicine is long known for its efficient management of diabetes. The current review discusses the scope of some common medicinal herbs as well as secondary metabolites with a special focus on diabetes-mediated central nervous system complications. Literatures suggest that natural products reduce diabetes-mediated neurological complications partly by reducing oxidative stress and/or inflammation or apoptosis in certain brain regions. Natural products are known to modulate diabetes-mediated alterations in the level of acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase, monoamine oxidase, serotonin receptors, muscarinic receptors, insulin receptor, nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neuropeptide in brain. Further, there are several natural products reported to manage diabetic complications with unknown mechanism. In conclusion, medicinal plants or their secondary metabolites have a wide scope and possess therapeutic potential to effectively manage neurological complications associated with chronic diabetes.

28400733|t|Optimization of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction for Ischemic Stroke Treatment and Mechanistic Study by Metabolomic Profiling and Network Analysis.
28400733|a|Optimal drug proportions and mechanism deciphering of multicomponent drugs are critical for developing novel therapies to cope with complex diseases, such as stroke. In the present study, orthogonal experimental design was applied to explore the optimal proportion of the four component herbs in Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) on the treatment of ischemic stroke. The treatment efficacies and mechanisms were assessed using global and amino acids (AAs) targeted metabolomics, as well as correlation network analysis. The global NMR metabolomics results revealed that AAs metabolism was significantly perturbed in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats. The levels of 23 endogenous AAs were then subjected to HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis. These results complemented with neurobehavioral evaluations, cerebral infarct assessments, biochemical evaluations, histological inspections and immunohistochemistry observations strongly demonstrated that HLJDD with optimal proportion of 6 (Rhizoma coptidis): 4 (Radix scutellariae): 1 (Cortex phellodendr): 3 (Fructus Gardeniae) had the best efficacy on ischemic stroke, which could be ascribed to its modulation on AA metabolism. This integrated metabolomics approach showed the potential and applicable in deciphering the complex mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine formulae on the treatment of complicated diseases, which provided new means to assess the treatment effects of herb combinations and to further development of drugs or therapies based on these formulae.

28213110|t|Effect of Chinese herbal medicine on stroke patients with type 2 diabetes.
28213110|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Complications of type 2 diabetes (T2D) include stroke, which is a cerebrovascular disturbance characterized by reduced blood flow in the brain, leading to death or physical disability. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been widely used in ancient China for the treatment of diabetes and stroke by supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the frequencies and patterns of CHM treatment for stroke patients with T2D and the outcomes of long-term use in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 3079 stroke patients (ICD-9-CM: 430-438) with T2D. We allocated 618 stroke patients, matched for age, gender, and T2D-to-stroke duration, to both CHM and non-CHM groups. Chi-square test, conditional multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test were used in this study. RESULTS: The CHM group was characterized by more cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ulcer disease, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and higher income. The cumulative survival probability was higher in the CHM group (P<0.001, log rank test); after adjusting for comorbidities, income, and urbanization level, this group also exhibited a lower mortality hazard ratio (0.37, 95% confidence interval [0.25-0.55]). Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang, Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang, and Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng-Tang; and Dan-Shen, Niu-Xi, and Yan-Hu-Suo represented the top three formulas and herbs, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of CHM as adjunctive therapy may improve the overall survival (OS) of stroke patients with T2D. The list of the comprehensive herbal medicines that they used might be useful in future large-scale, randomized clinical investigations of agent effectiveness, safety, and potential interactions with conventional treatments in stroke patients with T2D.

28134488|t|Bioactivity screening, extraction, and separation of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors from Polygala tenuifolia Willd. based on a hyphenated strategy.
28134488|a|Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors are currently widely used in the treatment of ischemic stroke, and natural products are considered promising sources of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors. In this study, ultrafiltration liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used for the screening and identification of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors from Polygala tenuifolia. Furthermore, five lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, sibiricose A5, 3,6'-di-O-sinapoyl-sucrose, glomeratose A, tenuifoliside B, and tenuifoliside C, were selected as target lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors. In addition, the five target compounds with purities of 96.45, 97.65, 96.38, 94.34, and 93.29% were extracted and isolated using a new hyphenated strategy of microwave-assisted extraction coupled with countercurrent chromatography with a two-phase solvent system of n-hexane/n-butanol/ethanol/water (5.321:1.00:1.664:6.647). The bioactivities of the isolated compounds were analyzed using PC12 cells and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The results also demonstrated that microwave-assisted extraction coupled with countercurrent chromatography is an efficient method of isolating chemical constituents from medicinal herbs. Moreover, the research route consisting of activity screening, extraction, separation, and activity verification of the compounds has the advantages of being efficient, orientated, and objective.

28367097|t|Lyophilized Powder of Catalpol and Puerarin Protected Cerebral Vessels from Ischemia by Its Anti-apoptosis on Endothelial Cells.
28367097|a|Catalpol and puerarin are two monomers of Rehmannia glutinosa and Lobed Kudzuvine Root, which are two herbs commonly used together in ancient prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine for cerebral ischemia. Our previous study shows that the lyophilized powder of the two monomers improved the outcome of cerebral ischemia excellently in rodents. However, if it protects vessels from ischemia is unknown. The present research studied the protection of lyophilized powder of catalpol and puerarin (CP) on endothelial cells and the relative mechanism in vivo and in vitro. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats were used to study the improvement of CP on neurological deficiency, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and infarct volume. The morphology of vessels and the apoptosis of brain vascular endothelial cells (BVECs) were observed and detected by immunohistochemistry approaches. To study how CP protected primary BVECs (pBVECs) from ischemic penumbra, oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-damaged pBVECs were cultured in the condition of insufficient nutrition and low oxygen which recapitulate the low perfusion of ischemic penumbra. Using the cell model, the mechanism by which CP protected pBVECs was studied by shRNA and pathway inhibitors. CP at the dose of 65.4 mg/kg increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), reduced infarct volume, protected vessel integrity and inhibited endothelial cell apoptosis in vivo. But it only improved rCBF, vessel integrity and BVECs apoptosis at the dose of 32.7 mg/kg. In vitro, the protection of CP on pBVECs was proved to be ERK/HIF-1a- and PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1a-dependent. This study indicates a possibility of CP being a new drug for cerebral ischemia. Besides, this research provides an alternative cell model for penumbra ECs study.

28168001|t|The neuroprotective effects of Tao-Ren-Cheng-Qi Tang against embolic stroke in rats.
28168001|a|BACKGROUND: Combinations of the traditional Chinese and Western medicines have been used to treat numerous diseases throughout the world, and there is a growing body of evidence showing that some of the herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine elicit significant pharmacological effects. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of Tao-Ren-Cheng-Qi Tang (TRCQT) in combination with aspirin following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced embolic stroke in rats. METHODS: A blood clot was embolized into the middle cerebral artery of rats to induce focal ischemic brain injury. After 24 h of MCAO occlusion, the rats were arbitrarily separated into five groups and subjected to different oral treatment processes with TRCQT and aspirin for 30 days before being evaluated in terms of their neurological behavior using a four-point system. The rats were sacrificed at 30 days after drug treatment and the infarct volumes were measured using a 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining method. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), activated caspase-3 and Bax were detected by western blot analysis. The apoptotic cells were identified by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. ROS generation was also measured by electron spin resonance spectrometry. RESULTS: Rats treated with TRCQT alone or in combination with aspirin showed a significantly reduced infarct volume (P < 0.001) and improved neurological outcome compared with those treated with distilled water. Rats treated with TRCQT alone (P = 0.021) or in combination with aspirin (P = 0.02) also showed significantly reduced MCAO-induced expression levels of TNF-α and pJNK (P < 0.001) in their ischemic regions. Rats treated with TRCQT alone or in combination with aspirin showed decreased apoptosis by a reduction in the number of TUNEL positive cells, which inhibited the expression of activated caspase-3 (P = 0.038) and Bax (P = 0.004; P = 0.003). TRCQT also led to a significant concentration-dependent reduction in the formation of hydroxyl radicals (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TRCQT reduced brain infarct volume and improved neurological outcomes by reducing apoptosis, attenuating the expression of TNF-α and p-JNK, and reducing the formation of hydroxyl radicals in MCAO-induced embolic stroke of rats.

27956075|t|Natural product HTP screening for attenuation of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemo attractants (CINCs) and NO2- in LPS/IFNγ activated glioma cells.
27956075|a|Chronic and acute central nervous system (CNS) inflammation are contributors toward neurological injury associated with head trauma, stroke, infection, Parkinsons or Alzheimers disease. CNS inflammatory illnesses can also contribute toward risk of developing glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). With growing public interest in complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs), we conduct a high throughput (HTP) screening of >1400 natural herbs, plants and over the counter (OTC) products for anti-inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon gamma (IFNγ) activated C6 glioma cells. Validation studies were performed showing a pro-inflammatory profile of [LPS 3 µg/ml/ IFNγ 3 ng/ml] consistent with greater release [>8.5 fold] of MCP-1, NO2-, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemo-attractants (CINC) 1, CINC 2a and CINC3. The data show no changes to the following, IL-13, TNF-a, fracktaline, leptin, LIX, GM-CSF, ICAM1, L-Selectin, activin A, agrin, IL-1α, MIP-3a, B72/CD86, NGF, IL-1b, MMP-8, IL-1 R6, PDGF-AA, IL-2, IL-4, prolactin R, RAGE, IL-6, Thymus Chemokine-1, CNTF,IL-10 or TIMP-1. A HTP screening was conducted, where we employ an in vitro efficacy index (iEI) defined as the ratio of toxicity (LC50)/anti-inflammatory potency (IC50). The iEI was precautionary to ensure biological effects were occurring in fully viable cells (ratio > 3.8) independent of toxicity. Using NO2- as a guideline molecule, the data show that 1.77% (25 of 1410 tested) had anti-inflammatory effects with iEI ratios >3.8 and IC50s <250µg/ml. These include reference drugs (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone N6-(1-iminoethyl)-l-lysine and NSAIDS: diclofenac, tolfenamic acid), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (apicidin) and the following natural products; Ashwaganda (Withania somnifera), Elecampagne Root (Inula helenium), Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), Turmeric Root (Curcuma longa) Ganthoda (Valeriana wallichii), Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), Maddar Root (Rubia tinctoria), Red Sandle wood (Pterocarpus santalinus), Bay Leaf (Laurus nobilis, Lauraceae), quercetin, cardamonin, fisetin, EGCG, biochanin A, galangin, apigenin and curcumin. The herb with the largest iEI was Ashwaganda where the IC50/LC50 was 11.1/>1750.0μg/ml, and the compound with the greatest iEI was quercetin where the IC50/LC50 was 10.0/>363.6μg/ml. These substances also downregulate the production of iNOS expression and attenuate CINC-3 release. In summary, this HTP screening provides guideline information about the efficacy of natural products that could prevent inflammatory processes associated with neurodegenerative disease and aggressive glioma tumor growth.

29234386|t|Neuroprotective Effect of Modified Xijiao Dihuang Decoction against Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation and Reoxygenation-Induced Injury in PC12 Cells: Involvement of TLR4-MyD88/NF-κB Signaling Pathway.
29234386|a|Modified Xijiao Dihuang (XJDH) decoction has been shown to exert powerful neuroprotective properties in clinical ischemic stroke treatment. It consists of 4 Chinese herbs: Buffalo Horn, Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews, Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn.) DC, and Paeonia lactiflora Pall. In the present study, the neuroprotective effect and specific mechanisms of XJDH in protecting PC12 cells from oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced injury were investigated. It was found that OGD/R significantly decreased the cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and increased the release of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in PC12 cells, and these effects were suppressed by XJDH and one of its major active constituents, paeoniflorin. Additionally, XJDH inhibited caspase-3 activity and reduced cleaved caspase-3 level. Mechanistic studies showed that the expressions of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, and NF-κB p65 and phosphorylation of IκBα and p65 were significantly lower in the XJDH-treated group than in the OGD/R control group. Additionally, XJDH reversed the OGD/R-induced increases in p-JNK and p-ERK1/2 expression. These results suggest that XJDH protects PC12 cells from oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced injury, which may be associated with the inhibition of the TLR4-MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. As an anti-inflammation factor, XJDH might be used as a neuronal protection strategy for the ischemia injury and related diseases.

29317985|t|Polyphenols and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerosis-Related Ischemic Heart Disease and Stroke.
29317985|a|Good nutrition could maintain health and life. Polyphenols are common nutrient mainly derived from fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, cocoa, mushrooms, beverages, and traditional medicinal herbs. They are potential substances against oxidative-related diseases, for example, cardiovascular disease, specifically, atherosclerosis-related ischemic heart disease and stroke, which are health and economic problems recognized worldwide. In this study, we reviewed the risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and cigarette smoking as well as the antioxidative activity of polyphenols, which could prevent the pathology of atherosclerosis, including endothelial dysfunction, low-density lipoprotein oxidation, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, inflammatory process by monocytes, macrophages or T lymphocytes, and platelet aggregation. The strong radical-scavenging properties of polyphenols would exhibit antioxidative and anti-inflammation effects. Polyphenols reduce ROS production by inhibiting oxidases, reducing the production of superoxide, inhibiting OxLDL formation, suppressing VSMC proliferation and migration, reducing platelet aggregation, and improving mitochondrial oxidative stress. Polyphenol consumption also inhibits the development of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Despite the numerous in vivo and in vitro studies, more advanced clinical trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy of polyphenols in the treatment of atherosclerosis-related vascular diseases.

27762458|t|Role of Medicinal Plants for Liver-Qi Regulation Adjuvant Therapy in Post-stroke Depression: A Systematic Review of Literature.
27762458|a|Current evidence demonstrated certain beneficial effects of medicinal herbs as an adjuvant therapy for post-stroke depression (PSD) in China; Chai-hu (Chinese Thorowax Root, Radix Bupleuri) is an example of a medicinal plant for Liver-Qi regulation (MPLR) in the treatment of PSD. Despite several narrative reports on the antidepressant properties of MPLR, it appears that there are no systematic reviews to summarize its outcome effects. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of MPLR adjuvant therapy in patients with PSD. Seven databases were extensively searched from January 2000 until July 2016. Randomized control trials (RCTs) involving patients with PSD that compared treatment with and without MPLR were taken into account. The pooled effect estimates were calculated based on Cochrane Collaboration's software RevMan 5.3. Finally, 42 eligible studies with 3612 participants were included. Overall, MPLR adjuvant therapy showed a significantly higher effective rate (RR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.19, 1.27; p < 0.00001) compared to those without. Moreover, the administration of MPLR was superior to abstainers regarding Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score changes after 3 weeks (WMD = -4.83; 95% CI = -6.82, -2.83; p < 0.00001), 4 weeks (WMD = -3.25; 95% CI = -4.10, -2.40; p < 0.00001), 6 weeks (WMD = -4.04; 95% CI = -5.24, -2.84; p < 0.00001), 8 weeks (WMD = -4.72; 95% CI = -5.57, -3.87; p < 0.00001), and 12 weeks (WMD = -3.07; 95% CI = -4.05, -2.09; p < 0.00001). In addition, there were additive benefits in terms of response changes for the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and other self-rating scores. No frequently occurring or serious adverse events were reported. We concluded that there is supporting evidence that adjuvant therapy with MPLR is effective in reducing the depressive symptoms and enhancing quality of life for patients with PSD. More well-designed RCTs are necessary to explore the role of MPLR in the treatment of PSD. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

27779107|t|The components of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction act synergistically to exert protective effects in a rat ischemic stroke model.
27779107|a|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD, Oren-gedoku-to in Japanese) is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat ischemic stroke. This study investigated the efficacy of various combinations of the major components of HLJDD, berberine (A), baicalin (B), and jasminoidin (C), on the treatment of ischemic stroke modeled by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. The effects of A, B and C individually and their combinations were investigated using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)-based metabolomics complemented with neurologic deficit scoring, infarct volume measurement, biochemistry, histopathology and immunohistochemistry, as well as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Ischemic stroke produces severe oxidative stress, which induces further damage. Our results show that the ABC combination treatment increased levels of cellular antioxidants that scavenged reactive oxygen species during ischemia-reperfusion via the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling cascade. These protective effects were not observed with the other treatments. These results suggest that a combination of component herbs in HLJDD exhibit stronger effects than the individual herbs alone. Our integrated metabolomics approach also provides a tractable, powerful tool for understanding the science behind TCM formulations.

27814708|t|Neuroprotective effect of a novel Chinese herbal decoction on cultured neurons and cerebral ischemic rats.
27814708|a|BACKGROUND: Historically, traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used to treat stroke. Based on the theory of Chinese medicine and the modern pharmacological knowledge of herbal medicines, we have designed a neuroprotective formula called Post-Stroke Rehabilitation (PSR), comprising seven herbs - Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Cassia obtusifolia L., Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort., Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. We aim to examine the neuroprotective activity of PSR in vitro and in vivo, and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, to better understand its therapeutic effect and to further optimize its efficacy. METHODS: PSR extract or vehicle was applied to primary rat neurons to examine their survival effects against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-elicited excitotoxicity. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was conducted to examine the NMDA-induced current in the presence of PSR. ERK- and CREB-activation were revealed by western blot analysis. Furthermore, PSR was tested for CRE promoter activation in neurons transfected with a luciferase reporter. The protective effect of PSR was then studied in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. MCAO rats were either treated with PSR extract or vehicle, and their neurobehavioral deficit and cerebral infarct were evaluated. Statistical differences were analyzed by ANOVA or t-test. RESULTS: PSR prominently reduced the death of cultured neurons caused by NMDA excitotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating its neuroprotective property. Furthermore, PSR significantly reduced NMDA-evoked current reversibly and activated phosphorylation of ERK and CREB with distinct time courses, with the latter's kinetics slower. PSR also triggered CRE-promoter activity as revealed by the increased expression of luciferase reporter in transfected neurons. PSR effectively reduced cerebral infarct and deficit in neurological behavior in MCAO rats when PSR decoction was administered starting either 6 days before or 6 h after onset of ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: PSR is neuroprotective both in vitro and in vivo - it protects cultured neurons against NMDA excitotoxicity, and effectively reduces ischemic injury and neurobehavioral deficit in MCAO rats in both the pre- and post-treatment regimens. The underlying neuroprotective mechanisms may involve inhibition of NMDA receptor current and activation of ERK and CREB. This study provides important preclinical data necessary for the further development of PSR for stroke treatment.

26526842|t|Evaluation of Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Helminthostachys zeylanica Extracts via Inhibiting Bradykinin-Induced MMP-9 Expression in Brain Astrocytes.
26526842|a|Phytochemicals present in vegetables, fruits, and herbs are believed to reduce the risk of several major diseases including cardiovascular or neurodegenerative disorders. The roots of the fern Helminthostachys zeylanica (L.) Hook. (Ophioglossaceae) have been used for centuries in the treatment of inflammation and as a folk medicine in several countries. The plant has been shown to possess an array of medicinal properties, including antioxidants and anti-inflammatory activities. Moreover, a rising level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has been found in blood fluid of these patients suffering from brain inflammatory diseases, which may be considered an inflammatory biomarker in several inflammatory diseases including the central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Previously, we have demonstrated the signaling mechanisms of bradykinin (BK)-induced MMP-9 expression in brain astrocytes. Herein, we evaluate the effects of H. zeylanica extracts on BK-induced MMP-9 expression in brain astrocytes and its influencing mechanism. The results showed that H. zeylanica extracts, including E0, E1, and E2 significantly reduce MMP-9 induced by BK in brain astrocytes (RBA-1 cells). These H. zeylanica extracts can inhibit BK-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Src, Pyk2, and PKC(α/δ). Moreover, BK-stimulated NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation has also been attenuated by pretreatment with these extracts, suggesting that the H. zeylanica extracts have an antioxidative activity. We further demonstrated that the H. zeylanica extracts blocked activation of MAPKs (e.g., ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK) by BK. These data indicated that the H. zeylanica extracts may be has anti-inflammatory activity by reducing BK-induced ROS-dependent MMP-9 expression via these related pathways in brain astrocytes.

27733030|t|Herbs and Rehabilitation after Stroke Study: A Multi-center, Double-blinded, Randomized Trial in Hong Kong.
27566677|t|An investigation of the use of acupuncture in stroke patients in Taiwan: a national cohort study.
27566677|a|BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is considered a complementary and alternative medicine in many countries. The purpose of this study was to report the pattern of acupuncture use and associated factors in patients with stroke. METHODS: We used claims data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and identified 285001 new-onset stroke patients in 2000-2008 from 23 million people allover Taiwan. The use of acupuncture treatment after stroke within one year was identified. We compared sociodemographics, coexisting medical conditions, and stroke characteristics between stroke patients who did and did not receive acupuncture treatment. RESULTS: The use of acupuncture in stroke patients increased from 2000 to 2008. Female gender, younger age, white-collar employee status, higher income, and residence in areas with more traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physicians were factors associated with acupuncture use in stroke patients. Ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.21, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.15-1.28), having no renal dialysis (OR 2.76, 95 % CI 2.45-3.13), receiving rehabilitation (OR 3.20, 95 % CI 3.13-3.27) and longer hospitalization (OR 1.23, 95 % CI 1.19-1.27) were also associated with acupuncture use. Stroke patients using rehabilitation services were more likely to have more acupuncture visits and a higher expenditure on acupuncture compared with stroke patients who did not receive rehabilitation services. CONCLUSIONS: The application of acupuncture in stroke patients is well accepted and increasing in Taiwan. The use of acupuncture in stroke patients is associated with sociodemographic factors and clinical characteristics.

27431009|t|Systematic investigation of transcription factors critical in the protection against cerebral ischemia by Danhong injection.
27431009|a|Systematic investigations of complex pathological cascades during ischemic brain injury help to elucidate novel therapeutic targets against cerebral ischemia. Although some transcription factors (TFs) involved in cerebral ischemia, systematic surveys of their changes during ischemic brain injury have not been reported. Moreover, some multi-target agents effectively protected against ischemic stroke, but their mechanisms, especially the targets of TFs, are still unclear. Therefore, a comprehensive approach by integrating network pharmacology strategy and a new concatenated tandem array of consensus transcription factor response elements method to systematically investigate the target TFs critical in the protection against cerebral ischemia by a medication was first reported, and then applied to a multi-target drug, Danhong injection (DHI). High-throughput nature and depth of coverage, as well as high quantitative accuracy of the developed approach, make it more suitable for analyzing such multi-target agents. Results indicated that pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 and cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor 1, along with six other TFs, are putative target TFs for DHI-mediated protection against cerebral ischemia. This study provides, for the first time, a systematic investigation of the target TFs critical to DHI-mediated protection against cerebral ischemia, as well as reveals more potential therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke.

27412100|t|Risk of epilepsy in stroke patients receiving acupuncture treatment: a nationwide retrospective matched-cohort study.
27412100|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of epilepsy in stroke patients receiving and not receiving acupuncture treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: This study was based on Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database that included information on stroke patients hospitalised between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2004. PARTICIPANTS: We identified 42 040 patients hospitalised with newly diagnosed stroke who were aged 20 years and above. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared incident epilepsy during the follow-up period until the end of 2009 in stroke patients who were and were not receiving acupuncture. The adjusted HRs and 95% CIs of epilepsy associated with acupuncture were calculated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Stroke patients who received acupuncture treatment (9.8 per 1000 person-years) experienced a reduced incidence of epilepsy compared to those who did not receive acupuncture treatment (11.5 per 1000 person-years), with an HR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.80) after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and coexisting medical conditions. Acupuncture treatment was associated with a decreased risk of epilepsy, particularly among stroke patients aged 20-69 years. The log-rank test probability curve indicated that stroke patients receiving acupuncture treatment had a reduced probability of epilepsy compared with individuals who did not receive acupuncture treatment during the follow-up period (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Stroke patients who received acupuncture treatment had a reduced risk of epilepsy compared with those not receiving acupuncture treatment. However, the protective effects associated with acupuncture treatment require further validation in prospective cohort studies.

27108052|t|Combination of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Radix Paeoniae ameliorate focal cerebral ischemic in MCAO rats via endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent apoptotic signaling pathway.
27108052|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Combination of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Radix Paeoniae (XS) is highly effective in the treatment for focal cerebral ischemic, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. This study was conducted to evaluate the combinative effects of XS on MCAO rats and explore the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCAO rats were used to evaluate the protective effect of Ligusticum chuanxiong (CX), Radix Paeoniae Rubra (CS) and their combination (XS) on ameliorating focal cerebral ischemic. Cerebral ischemia deficits and infarct size were performed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining. Activities of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px, as well as levels of LPO and MDA were detected by commercial kits while ELISA kits for the content of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and plasminogen activator (PA). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analysis (WB) were carried out to examine the protein expressions including PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), cytoplasmic of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), X box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), and porcineB-cellleukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in brain tissues. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) were applied to examine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR1) mRNA levels. RESULTS: CX, CS and their combination (XS) could reduce cerebral ischemia deficits and infarct size of MCAO rats. They increased SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities, and reduced MDA and LPO levels in serum, markedly. A significant decrease of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related factors PERK, XBP-1, ATF-6 and CHOP protein expression levels while an increase of GRP78 and MVD expression by the treatment of CX, CS and XS. It could also be observed that their treatment could reduce apoptotic damage of brain tissues by up-regulating Bax level and down-regulating Bcl-2 level. Furthermore, the levels of MMP-9 and PAI-1 in serum and tissues of rats were down-regulated remarkably while TIMP-1 and PA levels were up-regulated. VEGF mRNA level was up-regulated dramatically whereas NMDAR1 was reduced. Importantly, the combination of CX and CS, namely XS, has a more meaningful improvement on focal cerebral ischemic than CX or CS alone. CONCLUSION: All these revealed that the combined XS exerted more remarkable protective effects than alone. XS could inhibit neuronal apoptosis by attenuating ER-stress-dependent apoptotic signaling and protected the blood-brain barrier. These findings might supply beneficial hints for the synergy of CX and CS, and provide the basis for rationality of XS preparation and deserve further clinical investigations.

27275837|t|Angiogenesis in Ischemic Stroke and Angiogenic Effects of Chinese Herbal Medicine.
27275837|a|Stroke is one of the major causes of death and adult disability worldwide. The underlying pathophysiology of stroke is highly complicated, consisting of impairments of multiple signalling pathways, and numerous pathological processes such as acidosis, glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium overload, cerebral inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The current treatment for ischemic stroke is limited to thromolytics such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). tPA has a very narrow therapeutic window, making it suitable to only a minority of stroke patients. Hence, there is great urgency to develop new therapies that can protect brain tissue from ischemic damage. Recent studies have shown that new vessel formation after stroke not only replenishes blood flow to the ischemic area of the brain, but also promotes neurogenesis and improves neurological functions in both animal models and patients. Therefore, drugs that can promote angiogenesis after ischemic stroke can provide therapeutic benefits in stroke management. In this regard, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has a long history in treating stroke and the associated diseases. A number of studies have demonstrated the pro-angiogenic effects of various Chinese herbs and herbal formulations in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the current knowledge on angiogenesis in the context of ischemic stroke and discuss the potential use of CHM in stroke management through modulation of angiogenesis.

27059876|t|Screening and isolation of potential lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors from five Chinese medicinal herbs: Soybean, Radix pueraria, Flos pueraria, Rhizoma belamcandae, and Radix astragali.
27059876|a|Stroke is among the leading causes of death and severe disability worldwide. Flavonoids have been extensively used in the treatment of ischemic stroke by reducing lactate dehydrogenase levels and thereby enhancing blood perfusion to the ischemic region. Here, we used ultrafiltration high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and mass spectrometry for the rapid screening and identification of flavonoids from five Chinese medicinal herbs: soybean, Radix pueraria, Flos pueraria, Rhizoma belamcandae, and Radix astragali. Using PC12 cells as a suitable in vitro model of toxicity, cell viability was quantitated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The results showed that the extracts of soybean and the six major components, namely, acetyldaidzin, malonylgenistin, daidiain, glycitin, genistin, and acetylcitin; the extract of R. pueraria and its main component daidzein; the extract of F. pueraria and its three major components, tectorigenin, tectoridin, and tectorigenin-7-O-xylosylglucosid; and the extract of R. belamcandae and its main component, tectoridin, were strong lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors. Also, the components of R. astragali showed no bioactivity. These findings indicate that the ultrafltration high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and mass spectrometry method could be utilized in rapid screening and separation of bioactive compounds from a complex matrix.

27338955|t|Activating blood circulation to remove stasis treatment of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage: A multi-center prospective randomized open-label blinded-endpoint trial.
27338955|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of the Chinese herbal therapeutic regimen of activating blood circulation (TRABC) in treatment of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH). METHODS: This was a multi-center prospective randomized open-label blinded-endpoint (PROBE) trial with HICH admitted to 12 hospitals. Totally 240 participants were randomized to the treatment group treated with TRABC in addition to conventional Western treatment or the control group with conventional Western treatment equally for 3 months. Primary outcome was degree of disability as measured by modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary outcomes were the absorption of hematoma and edema, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and patient-reported outcome measures for stroke and Barthel activities of daily living index. Adverse events and mortality were also recorded. RESULTS: After 3 months of treatment, the rate of mRS 0-1 and mRS 0-2 in the treatment group was 72.5% and 80.4%, respectively, and in the control group 48.1% and 63.9%, respectively, with a significant difference between groups (P<0.01). Hematoma volume decreased significantly at day 7 of treatment in the treatment group than the control group (P=0.038). Average Barthel scores in the treatment group after treatment was 89.11±19.93, and in the control group 82.18±24.02 (P=0.003). NIHSS scores of the two groups after treatment decreased significantly compared with before treatment (P=0.001). Patient-reported outcomes in the treatment group were lower than the control group at day 21 and 3 months of treatment (P<0.05). There were 4 deaths, 2 in each group, and 11 adverse events, 6 in the treatment group and 5 in the control group. CONCLUSION: The integrative therapy combined TRABC with conventional Western treatment for HICH could promote hematoma absorption thus minimize neurologic impairment, without increasing intracerebral hematoma expansion and re-bleeding.

26081140|t|Ginsenoside Rd Is Efficacious Against Acute Ischemic Stroke by Suppressing Microglial Proteasome-Mediated Inflammation.
26081140|a|A great deal of attention has been paid to neuroprotective therapies for cerebral ischemic stroke. Our two recent clinical trials showed that ginsenoside Rd (Rd), a kind of monomeric compound extracted from Chinese herbs, Panax ginseng and Panax notoginseng, was safe and efficacious for the treatment of ischemic stroke. In this study, we conducted a pooled analysis of the data from 199 patients with acute ischemic stroke in the first trial and 390 in the second to reanalyze the efficacy and safety of Rd. Moreover, animal stroke models were carried out to explore the possible molecular mechanisms underlying Rd neuroprotection. The pooled analysis showed that compared with placebo group, Rd could improve patients' disability as assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score on day 90 post-stroke and reduce neurologic deficits on day 15 or day 90 post-stroke as assessed by NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Barthel Index (BI) scores. For neuroprotective mechanisms, administration of Rd 4 h after stroke could inhibit ischemia-induced microglial activation, decrease the expression levels of various proinflammatory cytokines, and suppress nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells inhibitor, alpha (IκBα) phosphorylation and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) nuclear translocation. An in vitro proteasome activity assay revealed a significant inhibitory effect of Rd on proteasome activity in microglia. Interestingly, Rd was showed to have less side effects than glucocorticoid. Therefore, our study demonstrated that Rd could safely improve the outcome of patients with ischemic stroke, and this therapeutic effect may result from its capability of suppressing microglial proteasome activity and sequential inflammation.

27062945|t|Reduced risk of stroke in patients with cardiac arrhythmia receiving traditional Chinese medicine: A nationwide matched retrospective cohort study.
27062945|a|OBJECTIVE: Patients with cardiac arrhythmia were more likely to develop stroke than general population. The therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on the risk of stroke in patients with cardiac arrhythmia was unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk of stroke in patients with cardiac arrhythmia receiving TCM. METHODS: From the one million cohort of the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified cohort of cardiac arrhythmia included 2029 patients who received TCM treatment in 2000-2004. The matching methods with propensity score was used to select 2029 appropriate control cohort for comparison. Incident events of stroke were identified during the follow-up period at the end of 2010. Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of stroke associated with TCM treatment. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, patients with cardiac arrhythmia who underwent TCM treatment (11.4 per 1000 person-years) had a lower incidence of new-onset stroke than those without TCM treatment (17.7 per 1000 person-years), with an HR of 0.62 (95% CI=0.50-0.78). The association between TCM treatment and decreased new-onset stroke was both significant in women and men. The young patients aged 45-54 years who received TCM had the lowest risk of stroke (HR=0.48, 95% CI=0.27-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Receiving TCM treatment was associated with a lower risk of stroke in patients with cardiac arrhythmia. However, this study was limited by lack of information regarding lifestyles, biochemical profiles, the dose of herbal medicine, and acupuncture points used in treatments.

26696600|t|Cloning, prokaryotic expression and functional analysis of squalene synthase (SQS) in Magnolia officinalis.
26696600|a|Magnolia officinalis Rehder et Wilson is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that is used to treat various diseases such as neurosis, anxiety, and stroke. The main secondary metabolites in magnolia bark are phenolic compounds and terpenoids. Squalene synthase plays a significant role in catalyzing two farnesyl diphosphate molecules to form squalene, the first precursor of triterpenoid, phytosterol, and cholesterol biosynthesis. In this study, a full-length cDNA of squalene synthase was cloned from M. officinalis and designated MoSQS (GenBank accession no. KT223496). The gene contains a 1240-bp open reading frame and it encodes a protein with 409 amino acids. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis clearly suggested that MoSQS shared high similarity with squalene synthases among other plants. Prokaryotic expression showed that a transmembrane domain-deleted (385-409 aa) MoSQS mutant (MoSQSΔTM) could be expressed in its soluble form in Escherichia coli Transetta (DE3). GC-MS analysis showed that squalene was detected in an in vitro reaction mixture. These results indicated that MoSQSΔTM was functional, thereby establishing an important foundation for the study of triterpenoid biosynthesis in M. officinalis.

27323607|t|[Effect of Comprehensive Protocol of Integrative Medicine on Motor Function, Activity of Daily Living and Quality of Life in Hemiplegia Patients after Stroke].
27323607|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of integrative medicine (IM) rehabilitation protocolon motor function, activity of daily living, and quality of life (QOL) in hemiplegia patients after stroke. METHODS: Totally 120 patients with post-stroke hemiplegia were allocated to four groups using sealed envalope drawing, i.e., the rehabilitation group, the Chinese medical treatment group, the acupuncture group, and the comprehensive rehabilitation group, 30 cases in each group. Based on routine rehabilitative training, patients in the Chinese medical treatment group, the acupuncture group, and the compre-hensive rehabilitation group received standardized treatment based on syndrome typing, Shi's Consciousness-Restoring Resuscitation acupuncture, Chinese herbs + acupuncture comprehensive rehabilitatino protocol, respectively. The treatmet cycle consisted of 4 weeks with 24-week follow-ups. Fugl-Meyer motor assessment (FMA), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale(SS-QQL), and safety assessment were taken as main effect indices before treatment, at week 4 of treatment, at week 12 and 24 of follow-ups, respectively. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in FMA score, MBI score, SS-QOL score among the four groups before treatment (P > 0.05). These scores were significantly improved in the four groups at week 4 of treatment, week 12 and 24 of follow-ups, respectively (P < 0.05). Besides, FMA score and SS-QOL score were significantly improved in the comprehensive rehabilitation group at each corresponding time point, as compared with other treatment groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive protocol could significantly improve motor function, activity of daily living in hemiplegia patients after stroke, and further improve their QOL. Its effect was better than other single treatment.

26593214|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was high in stroke patients but limited information was available on whether TCM is effective on post-stroke outcomes. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of stroke patients with and without receiving adjuvant TCM therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we conducted a nationwide cohort study and selected hospitalized stroke patients receiving routine care with (n=1734) and without (n=1734) in-hospital adjuvant TCM therapy by propensity score matching procedures. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of poststroke complications and mortality associated with in-hospital adjuvant TCM therapy were calculated. The use of medical resource was also compared between stroke patients with and without adjuvant TCM therapy. RESULTS: Compared with hospitalized stroke patients receiving routine care alone, hospitalized stroke patients receiving routine care and adjuvant TCM therapy exhibited decreased risks of urinary tract infection (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68-1.00), pneumonia (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47-0.76), epilepsy (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.96), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-0.98), and mortality (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.70) within 3 months after stroke admission. The corresponding 6-month HRs for urinary tract infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and mortality were 0.83, 0.63, 0.64, and 0.40, respectively. Less use and expenditure of hospitalization were found in those received adjuvant TCM therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized stroke patients who received routine care and adjuvant TCM therapy exhibited reduced adverse outcomes after admission within a 6-month follow-up period.

27671812|t|Emodin and Its Role in Chronic Diseases.
27671812|a|Diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes, are by far the leading cause of mortality in the world, representing 60 % of all deaths. Although substantial medical advances have been made and many therapeutic approaches proposed yet traditional medicine and medicinal plants find an important place in therapy. They have been providing invaluable solutions to the various health problems. Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is a natural anthraquinone derivative found in various Chinese medicinal herbs. Traditionally, it has been used as an active constituent of many herbal laxatives. However, in the last few years, significant progress has been made in studying the biological effects of emodin at cellular and molecular levels and it is emerging as an important therapeutic agent. This review provides an overview of the modulatory effects of emodin in various diseases and cell signaling pathways, which may have important implications in its future clinical use.

27703487|t|Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicines against Ischemic Injury in In Vivo Models of Cerebral Ischemia.
27703487|a|Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke. In the ischemic cascade, resident microglia are rapidly activated in the brain parenchyma and subsequently trigger inflammatory mediator release, which facilitates leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in inflammation. Activated leukocytes invade the endothelial cell junctions and destroy the blood-brain barrier integrity, leading to brain edema. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) stimulation in microglia/macrophages through the activation of intercellular signaling pathways secretes various proinflammatory cytokines and enzymes and then aggravates cerebral ischemic injury. The secreted cytokines activate the proinflammatory transcription factors, which subsequently regulate cytokine expression, leading to the amplification of the inflammatory response and exacerbation of the secondary brain injury. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), including TCM-derived active compounds, Chinese herbs, and TCM formulations, exert neuroprotective effects against inflammatory responses by downregulating the following: ischemia-induced microglial activation, microglia/macrophage-mediated cytokine production, proinflammatory enzyme production, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, matrix metalloproteinases, TLR expression, and deleterious transcription factor activation. TCMs also aid in upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokine expression and neuroprotective transcription factor activation in the ischemic lesion in the inflammatory cascade during the acute phase of cerebral ischemia. Thus, TCMs exert potent anti-inflammatory properties in ischemic stroke and warrant further investigation.

27123036|t|Identification of "Multiple Components-Multiple Targets-Multiple Pathways" Associated with Naoxintong Capsule in the Treatment of Heart Diseases Using UPLC/Q-TOF-MS and Network Pharmacology.
27123036|a|Naoxintong capsule (NXT) is a commercial medicinal product approved by the China Food and Drug Administration which is used in the treatment of stroke and coronary heart disease. However, the research on the composition and mechanism of NXT is still lacking. Our research aimed to identify the absorbable components, potential targets, and associated pathways of NXT with network pharmacology method. We explored the chemical compositions of NXT based on UPLC/Q-TOF-MS. Then, we used the five principles of drug absorption to identify absorbable ingredients. The databases of PharmMapper, Universal Protein, and the Molecule Annotation System were used to predict the main targets and related pathways. By the five principles of drug absorption as a judgment rule, we identified 63 compositions that could be absorbed in the blood in all 81 chemical compositions. Based on the constructed networks by the significant regulated 123 targets and 77 pathways, the main components that mediated the efficacy of NXT were organic acids, saponins, and tanshinones. Radix Astragali was the critical herbal medicine in NXT, which contained more active components than other herbs and regulated more targets and pathways. Our results showed that NXT had a therapeutic effect on heart diseases through the pattern "multiple components-multiple targets-multiple pathways."

27087820|t|An Analysis of the Combination Frequencies of Constituent Medicinal Herbs in Prescriptions for the Treatment of Stroke in Korean Medicine: Determination of a Group of Candidate Prescriptions for Universal Use.
27087820|a|In contrast to Western medicine, which typically prescribes one medicine to treat a specific disease, traditional East Asian medicine uses any one of a large number of different prescriptions (mixtures of medicinal herbs), according to the patient's characteristics. Although this can be considered an advantage, the lack of a universal prescription for a specific disease is considered a drawback of traditional East Asian medicine. The establishment of universally applicable prescriptions for specific diseases is therefore required. As a basic first step in this process, this study aimed to select prescriptions used in the treatment of stroke and, through the analysis of medicinal herb combination frequencies, select a high-frequency medicinal herb combination group for further experimental and clinical research. As a result, we selected some candidates of a medicinal herb combination and 13 candidates of a medicinal herb for the treatment of stroke.

26500174|t|Outcomes after Stroke in Patients with Previous Pressure Ulcer: A Nationwide Matched Retrospective Cohort Study.
26500174|a|BACKGROUND: Factors associated with poststroke adverse events were not completely understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether stroke patients with previous pressure ulcers had more adverse events after stroke. METHODS: Using the claims data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we conducted a retrospective cohort study matched by propensity score. Three thousand two first-ever stroke patients with previous pressure ulcer and 3002 first-ever stroke patients without pressure ulcer were investigated between 2002 and 2009. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of complications and 30-day mortality after stroke associated with previous pressure ulcer were calculated in the multivariate logistic regressions. RESULTS: Patients with pressure ulcer had significantly higher risk than control for poststroke urinary tract infection (OR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38-1.78), pneumonia (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.16-1.58), gastrointestinal bleeding (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04-1.66), and epilepsy (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.83-1.85). Stroke patients with pressure ulcer had increased 30-day poststroke mortality (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.55-2.61), particularly in those treated with debridement (OR: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.85-4.44) or high quantity of antibiotics (OR: 4.01, 95% CI: 2.10-7.66). Pressure ulcer was associated with poststroke mortality in both genders and patients aged 60 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed increased poststroke complications and mortality in patients with previous pressure ulcer, which suggests the urgent need for monitoring stroke patients for pressure ulcer history.

26817897|t|Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine Therapy and the Risk of Vascular Complications in Patients With Type II Diabetes Mellitus: A Nationwide, Retrospective, Taiwanese-Registry, Cohort Study.
26817897|a|With an increasing use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), evidence of long-term benefit with adjunctive TCM treatment is limited. This study investigated whether the concurrent TCM treatment reduces the risk of vascular complications in T2DM patients by using a large population from National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).We identified 33,457 adult patients with newly diagnosed T2DM using anti-diabetic agents from a random sample of one million beneficiaries in the NHIRD between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2011. We recruited 1049 TCM users (received TCM over 30 days with a diagnosis of T2DM) and randomly selected 4092 controls as the non-TCM cohort at a ratio of 1:4 frequency-matched by age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and index year. We investigated the prescription pattern of TCM and conducted a Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke, chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and diabetic foot between the 2 cohorts.In the TCM cohort, the prescription pattern of TCM was different between insulin and noninsulin patients. The most common herbs were Dan-Shen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae) in noninsulin group and Da-Huang (Radix et Rhizoma Rhei) in insulin group. The most common formulae were Liu-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan in noninsulin group and Yu-Quan-Wan in insulin group. Although no significant reduction in the hazard ratio of CKD and diabetic foot, the incidence rate of stroke was 7.19 per 1000 person-years in the TCM cohort and 10.66 per 1000 person-years in the control cohort, respectively. After adjustment of age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and antidiabetes agent use (including sulfonylureas, α-glucosidase, metformin, meglitinide, thiazolidinediones, and insulin), TCM cohorts were found to have a 33% decreased risk of stroke (95% CI = 0.46-0.97; P < 0.05).This population-based retrospective study showed that the complementary TCM therapy might associate with the decreased risk of stroke in T2DM, suggesting TCM as an adjunctive therapy for T2DM to prevent subsequent stroke.

26549268|t|Prescription patterns of traditional Chinese medicine for peptic ulcer disease in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study.
26549268|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Peptic ulcer disease is a common digestive disease. There is a lack of large-scale survey on the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of TCM for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a random sample comprised of one million individuals with newly diagnosed peptic ulcer disease between 2001 and 2010 from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Demographic characteristics and TCM usage, including Chinese herbal formulas and the single herbs prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 96,624 newly diagnosed subjects with peptic ulcer disease were included. 14,983 (15.5%) patients were TCM users. People residing in highly urbanized areas, younger people and female (compared with male) were more likely to use TCM. With regard to the comorbidities, TCM users had a lower prevalence of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis and stroke. The average time between onset of peptic ulcer disease and the first visit to a TCM clinic was 4.7 months. Majority of the patients (n=14,449; 96.4%) received only Chinese herbal remedies. The most frequently prescribed Chinese herbal formula and single herb was Ban-Xia-Xie-Xin-Tang (Pinelliae Decoction to Drain the Epigastrium) and Hai-Piao-Xiao (Os Sepiae), respectively. The core pattern analysis showed that combination of Ban-Xia-Xie-Xin-Tang, Hai-Piao-Xiao (Os Sepiae), Yan-Hu-Suo (Rhizoma Corydalis), Bei-Mu (Bulbus Fritillariae Thunbergii) and Chuan-Lian-Zi (Fructus Toosendan) was most frequently used for peptic ulcer disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified the core prescription patterns of TCM for patients with peptic ulcer disease in Taiwan. Further basic and clinical studies are necessary to elucidate the efficacy and mechanisms.

26306935|t|Pharmacologic overview of Withania somnifera, the Indian Ginseng.
26306935|a|Withania somnifera, also called 'Indian ginseng', is an important medicinal plant of the Indian subcontinent. It is widely used, singly or in combination, with other herbs against many ailments in Indian Systems of Medicine since time immemorial. Withania somnifera contains a spectrum of diverse phytochemicals enabling it to have a broad range of biological implications. In preclinical studies, it has shown anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-stress, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-diabetic properties. Additionally, it has demonstrated the ability to reduce reactive oxygen species, modulate mitochondrial function, regulate apoptosis, and reduce inflammation and enhance endothelial function. In view of these pharmacologic properties, W. somnifera is a potential drug candidate to treat various clinical conditions, particularly related to the nervous system. In this review, we summarize the pharmacologic characteristics and discuss the mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic applications of the plant and its active constituents.

26426630|t|A Retrospective Cohort Study Comparing Stroke Recurrence Rate in Ischemic Stroke Patients With and Without Acupuncture Treatment.
26426630|a|Little was known about the effects of acupuncture on stroke recurrence. The aim of this study is to investigate whether ischemic stroke patients receiving acupuncture treatment have a decreased risk of stroke recurrence. A retrospective cohort study of 30,058 newly diagnosed cases of ischemic stroke in 2000 to 2004 was conducted based on the claims of Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The use of acupuncture treatment and stroke recurrence were identified during the follow-up period from 2000 to 2009. This study compared the risk of stroke recurrence between ischemic stroke cohorts with and without acupuncture treatment by calculating adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of acupuncture associated with stroke recurrence in the Cox proportional hazard model. The stroke recurrence rate per 1000 person-years decreased from 71.4 without to 69.9 with acupuncture treatment (P < 0.001). Acupuncture treatment was associated with reduced risk of stroke recurrence (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.84-0.91). The acupuncture effect was noted in patients with or without medical treatment for stroke prevention but its impact decreased with aging of stroke patients. Compared with stroke patients without acupuncture treatment and medication therapy, the hazard ratios of stroke recurrence for those had medication therapy only, acupuncture only, and both were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.46), 0.50 (95% CI 0.43-0.57), and 0.39 (95% CI 0.35-0.43), respectively. This study raises the possibility that acupuncture might be effective in lowering stroke recurrence rate even in those on medications for stroke prevention. Results suggest the need of prospective sham-controlled and randomized trials to establish the efficacy of acupuncture in preventing stroke.

25687091|t|A Systems Biology Perspective on the Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Therapeutic Effects of Buyang Huanwu Decoction on Ischemic Stroke.
25687091|a|Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide. The outcome is worse in older patients, especially in terms of disability. Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD), a famous traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been used extensively in the treatment of ischemic stroke for centuries. However, its pharmacological mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, 82 putative targets for 411 composite compounds contained in BHD were predicted on the basis of our previously developed target prediction system. On the basis of large-scale molecular docking, more than 80% compound-putative target pairs had medium to strong binding efficiency. The pharmacological networks of BHD were built according to relationships among herbs, putative targets, and known therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke, and 121 major nodes were identified by calculating three topological features-degree, node betweenness, and closeness. Importantly, the pathway enrichment analysis identified several signaling pathways involved with major putative targets of BHD, such as the calcium signaling pathway, vascular smooth muscle contraction, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway, which have not hitherto been reported. These data are expected to help find new therapeutic effects of BHD and optimize clinical use of this formula. Collectively, our study developed a comprehensive systems approach integrating drug target prediction and network and functional analyses to reveal the relationships of the herbs in BHD with their putative targets, and for the first time with ischemic stroke-related pathway systems. This is a pilot study based on bioinformatics analysis; thus, further experimental studies are required to validate our findings.

26133313|t|Interventions for post-stroke fatigue.
26133313|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a common and distressing problem after stroke. The best ways to prevent or treat PSF are uncertain. Several different interventions can be argued to have a rational basis. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether, among people with stroke, any intervention reduces the proportion of people with fatigue, fatigue severity, or both; and to determine the effect of intervention on health-related quality of life, disability, dependency and death, and whether such intervention is cost effective. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched May 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2014), EMBASE (1980 to May 2014), CINAHL (1982 to May 2014), AMED (1985 to May 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2014), Digital Dissertations (1861 to May 2014), British Nursing Index (1985 to May 2014), PEDro (searched May 2014) and PsycBITE (searched May 2014). We also searched four ongoing trials registries, scanned reference lists, performed citation tracking of included trials and contacted experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two review authors independently scrutinised all titles and abstracts and excluded obviously irrelevant studies. We obtained the full texts for potentially relevant studies and three review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an intervention with a control, or compared different interventions for PSF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each included trial. The primary outcomes were severity of fatigue, or proportion of people with fatigue after treatment. We performed separate analyses for trials investigating efficacy in treating PSF, trials investigating efficacy in preventing PSF and trials not primarily investigating efficacy in PSF but which reported fatigue as an outcome. We pooled results from trials that had a control arm. For trials that compared different potentially active interventions without a control arm, we performed analyses for individual trials without pooling.We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) as the effect size for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We pooled the results using a random-effects model and assessed heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. We performed separate subgroup analyses for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. We also performed sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS: We retrieved 12,490 citations, obtained full texts for 58 studies and included 12 trials (three from the 2008 search and nine from the 2014 search) with 703 participants. Eight trials primarily investigated the efficacy in treating PSF, of which six trials with seven comparisons provided data suitable for meta-analysis (five pharmacological interventions: fluoxetine, enerion, (-)-OSU6162, citicoline and a combination of Chinese herbs; and two non-pharmacological interventions: a fatigue education programme and a mindfulness-based stress reduction programme). The fatigue severity was lower in the intervention groups than in the control groups (244 participants, pooled SMD -1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.93 to -0.21), with significant heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 87%, degrees of freedom (df) = 6, P value < 0.00001). The beneficial effect was not seen in trials that had used adequate allocation concealment (two trials, 89 participants, SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.04) or trials that had used adequate blinding of outcome assessors (four trials, 198 participants, SMD -1.10, 95% CI -2.31 to 0.11).No trial primarily investigated the efficacy in preventing PSF.Four trials (248 participants) did not primarily investigate the efficacy on fatigue but other symptoms after stroke. None of these interventions showed any benefit on reducing PSF, which included tirilazad mesylate, continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnoea, antidepressants and a self management programme for recovery from chronic diseases. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was insufficient evidence on the efficacy of any intervention to treat or prevent fatigue after stroke. Trials to date have been small and heterogeneous, and some have had a high risk of bias. Some of the interventions described were feasible in people with stroke, but their efficacy should be investigated in RCTs with a more robust study design and adequate sample sizes.

25937634|t|Deciphering the pharmacological mechanism of the Chinese formula huanglian-jie-du decoction in the treatment of ischemic stroke using a systems biology-based strategy.
25937634|a|AIM: Huanglian-jie-du decoction (HLJDD) is an important multiherb remedy in TCM, which is recently demonstrated to be effective to treat ischemic stroke. Here, we aimed to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of HLJDD in the treatment of ischemic stroke using systems biology approaches. METHODS: Putative targets of HLJDD were predicted using MetaDrug. An interaction network of putative HLJDD targets and known therapeutic targets for the treatment of ischemic stroke was then constructed, and candidate HLJDD targets were identified by calculating topological features, including 'Degree', 'Node-betweenness', 'Closeness', and 'K-coreness'. The binding efficiencies of the candidate HLJDD targets with the corresponding compositive compounds were further validated by a molecular docking simulation. RESULTS: A total of 809 putative targets were obtained for 168 compositive compounds in HLJDD. Additionally, 39 putative targets were common to all four herbs of HLJDD. Next, 49 major nodes were identified as candidate HLJDD targets due to their network topological importance. The enrichment analysis based on the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation system and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway demonstrated that candidate HLJDD targets were more frequently involved in G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions and gap junctions, which all played important roles in the progression of ischemic stroke. Finally, the molecular docking simulation showed that 170 pairs of chemical components and candidate HLJDD targets had strong binding efficiencies. CONCLUSION: This study has developed for the first time a comprehensive systems approach integrating drug target prediction, network analysis and molecular docking simulation to reveal the relationships between the herbs contained in HLJDD and their putative targets and ischemic stroke-related pathways.

26591507|t|[Neuroprotection of herbs promoting EPO on cerebral ischemia].
26591507|a|Amounts of researches show that EPO is characterized with neurotrophic and neuroprotective manner, especially in brain stroke, which attracts a large numbers of researchers to study it. With the accumulating researches on its neuroprotection, many related mechanisms were revealed, such as antioxidant, anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory, which suggests a multiple targets role of EPO on brain stroke. However, because of the high risk of thromboembolism in clinical administration of rhEPO and its analogs, the herbs are potential to be a replacer for its less side effects. Many researchers suggested that a larger of herbs were founded having the action of increasing the endogenous EPO in the model of anemia and cerebral ischemia. At the same time, there herbs were also proved that they had the action of against cerebral ischemia while some without considering the role of EPO in the reports. Considering of the action of promoting EPO of these herbs and the neural protection of EPO, this essay mainly summarizes the studies of herbs promoting EPO in the cerebral ischemia and discusses the mechanism of regulating the EPO of these herbs, for the aim of finding the potential drugs against cerebral ischemia.

26159020|t|[Efficacy of Chinese Herbs for Supplementing Qi and Activating Blood Circulation on Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: a Clinical Observation].
26159020|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of Chinese herbs for supplementing qi and activating blood circulation (CHSQABC) on patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: In this ChiCTR-TRC-00000021, a total of 281 ACS patients complicated with type 2 DM after successful PCI were randomly assigned to the Western medicine treatment group (the control group, treated by routine Western medicine treatment) and the combined treatment group (the treatment group, treated by CHSQABC + routine Western medicine treatment). Patients in the combined treatment group took Xinyue Capsule (2 pills each time, 3 times per day) and Compound Chuanxiong Capsule (2 pills each time, 3 times per day for half a year and 1-year follow-ups). Primary endpoints covered incidence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia-driven revascularization, and secondary endpoints included stroke, heart failure, and rehospitalization for ACS. At the same time scores for blood stasis syndrome (BSS) and the incidence of angina pectoris were evaluated before treatment, at month 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after treatment. RESULTS: The incidence of ischemia-driven revascularization was obviously less in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.05). No patient had nonfatal MI in the treatment group, while 5 patients in the control group had it. The incidence of non-fatal MI showed an obvious lowering tendency in the treatment group, but with no statistical difference when compared with that in the control group (P > 0.05). Four patients readmitted to hospital in the treatment group, while 12 patients readmitted. There existed obvious tendency in the treatment group, but with no statistical difference when compared with that in the control group (P > 0.05). The incidence of angina was significantly lower in the treatment group at month 6, 9, and 12 than that at month 1 , but it was lower in the control group at 9 months (P < 0.05). The incidence of angina was 15. 4% in the treatment group, obviously lower than that in the control group (26.2%, P < 0.05). Compared with before treatment, scores for BSS were obviously lowered in the treatment group at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment and in the control group at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment (P < 0.05). It was obviously lower in the treatment group than in the control group at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Administration of CHSQABC combined routine Western medicine treatment could reduce the event of revascularization and post-PCI recurrent angina, and improve scores for BSS of ACS patients complicated with DM after PCI.

25521531|t|Treatment of chronic conditions with traditional Chinese medicine: findings from traditional Chinese medicine hospitals in Hubei, China.
25521531|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to document clinical use of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for chronic conditions in all TCM hospitals in a Chinese province and to recommend treatments most in need of evaluation for use in community health centers. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the summer of 2010. It included 119 of 132 TCM hospitals in Hubei Province, China. TCM physicians were asked to recommend specific TCM treatments for common chronic conditions. Nine types of chronic conditions recommended more than 3.7 times (mean of frequencies of chronic conditions) are included in this analysis. Frequency of each TCM treatment and the number of visits by type of chronic conditions were calculated. RESULTS: The total number of recommendations by TCM physicians was 411. For seven types of treatments, six were recommended for musculoskeletal pain, five for soft tissue injuries, four for visceral pain and fractures, three for stroke and asthma, two for hemorrhoids, and one for hypertension. The most frequently recommended treatments for specific conditions include orally ingested herbs for visceral pain (n=3), type 2 diabetes (n=5), and hypertension (n=7); herbs for external use for soft tissue injuries (n=10), asthma (n=6), and hemorrhoids (n=8); acupuncture for musculoskeletal pains (n=43) and for stroke (n=10); and Chinese external fixation for fractures (n=24). The number of visits for recommended treatments per year of was 671,759. The most frequently recommended treatments for specific chronic conditions have most visits, except for chronic conditions such as musculoskeletal pains, visceral pains, soft tissue injuries, and asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with musculoskeletal pain have more treatment options than other patients. Herbal medicine is the option most commonly used for chronic conditions. These treatments for these conditions should be targeted for further evaluation of effectiveness and, only if found effective, considered for use in primary care settings.

25475247|t|Integrative medicine for subacute stroke rehabilitation: a study protocol for a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial.
25475247|a|INTRODUCTION: Many patients with stroke receive integrative medicine in China, which includes the basic treatment of Western medicine and routine rehabilitation, in conjunction with acupuncture and Chinese medicine. The question of whether integrative medicine is efficacious for stroke rehabilitation is still controversial and very little research currently exists on the integrated approach for this condition. Consequently, we will conduct a multicentre, randomised, controlled, assessor-blinded clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of integrative medicine on stroke rehabilitation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 360 participants recruited from three large Chinese medical hospitals in Zhejiang Province will be randomly divided into the integrative medicine rehabilitation (IMR) group and the conventional rehabilitation (CR) group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the IMR group will receive acupuncture and Chinese herbs in addition to basic Western medicine and rehabilitation treatment. The CR group will not receive acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. The assessment data will be collected at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks postrandomisation, and then at 12 weeks' follow-up. The primary outcome is measured by the Modified Barthel Index. The secondary outcomes are the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the mini-mental state examination and Montreal Cognitive, Hamilton's Depression Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the incidence of adverse events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from ethics committees of three hospitals. The results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international congresses. The results will also be disseminated to patients by telephone, during follow-up calls inquiring on patient's post-study health status. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Chinese Clinical Trial Register: ChiCTR-TRC-12001972, http://www.chictr.org/en/proj/show.aspx?proj=2561.

25069568|t|Atherosclerosis and tumor suppressor molecules (review).
25069568|a|Atherosclerosis, the major cause of heart attack and stroke, is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein through increased oxidative stress has been identified as one of the primary factors responsible for atherogenesis. Cell proliferation and death are key processes in the progression of atherosclerosis. The oxidative environment in areas of lipid accumulation is mainly created by the production of reactive oxygen species, which are assumed to mediate vascular tissue injury. Oxidative DNA damage and levels of DNA repair are reduced during dietary lipid lowering. The tumor suppressor molecules play a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation, DNA repair and cell death, which are important processes in regulating the composition of atherosclerotic plaque. Accordingly, in this review, we discuss the fundamental role of tumor suppressor molecules in regulating atherogenesis. In particular, we discuss how tumor suppressor molecules are activated in the complex environment of atherosclerotic plaque, and regulate growth arrest, cell senescence and the apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells, which may protect against the progression of atherosclerosis. In addition, we discuss promising alternatives to the use of medications (such as statin) against atherosclerosis, namely diet, with the use of plant-derived supplements to modulate the expression and/or activity of tumor suppressor molecules. We also summarize the progress of research made on herbs with a focus on the modulatory roles of tumor suppressors, and on the molecular mechanisms underlying the prevention if atherosclerosis, supporting designs for further research in this field.

24919707|t|Review of plants and their constituents in the therapy of cerebral ischemia.
24919707|a|Cerebral ischemia is a condition in which there is insufficient blood flow to the brain to meet metabolic demand. This leads to cerebral hypoxia and thus to the death of neuronal cells or stroke. The limited number of medicines currently available for patients following ischemic stroke and insufficient data on efficiency of these chemicals in the treatment of stroke led us to the search for novel therapeutic approaches. Recent studies have focused on the possible capacity of natural compounds extracted from vegetables and fruits, to prevent human disabilities caused by cerebral ischemia. In this review, we will discuss some plants and their constituents that may protect brain ischemia or delay the neurological disorders following a stroke. We have reviewed different studies in scientific databases that investigate herbal compounds and their effects on cerebral ischemia.

25333051|t|Low awareness of stroke guidelines and preference for Chinese herbs in community physicians: a national survey in China.
25333051|a|BACKGROUND: Physicians' adherence to stroke guidelines is becoming a critical part of public stroke care system. The objective of this national survey was to examine Chinese physicians' awareness of the guidelines in secondary stroke prevention. METHODS: This is a non-commercial and no-incentive internet survey. Respondents were asked to perform a self-examination of 13 questions regarding their stroke practice. Their awareness of stroke guidelines, preference for Chinese traditional herbs (CTH), and patients' expense for stroke treatment were surveyed and compared between physicians from community and from tertiary hospitals using univariate analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 8,581 physicians (70.1% from community hospitals) responded to the survey. Only 32.1% physicians considered risk factors control necessary for stroke. For the treatments of symptomatic carotid stenosis, only 10.4% physicians selected carotid endarterectomy and anti-platelet plus controlling stroke risk factors. Only 21.45% physicians selected warfarin anticoagulation for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. In contrast, a high percentage (64.56%) of physicians had positive attitude towards CTH. Compared with those from tertiary hospitals, community physicians were more likely unaware of the guidelines and preferred CTH. Those who prescribed CTH reported more patients' cost (P<0.001, OR 1.78, 95% CI, 1.55-2.04) than who didn't. CONCLUSIONS: There is a very low awareness of stroke guidelines in Chinese community physicians. A well-organized continuing stroke-guidelines education should be an essential part of public stroke-care system in China. Also, more well-designed clinical trials are required to establish the safety and effectiveness of CTH.

25230523|t|Advances in herbal medicine for treatment of ischemic brain injury.
25230523|a|Ischemic brain injury is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and has attracted a lot of attention in the field of drug discovery. Cerebral ischemia is a complex pathological process involving a series of mechanisms, including generation of free radicals, oxidative stress, disruption of the membrane function, release of neurotransmitters and apoptosis. Thrombolytic therapy is the most effective therapeutic strategy, but the benefits are far from being absolute. Increased attention in the field of drug discovery has been focused on using natural compounds from traditional medicinal herbs for neuroprotection, which appears to be a promising therapeutic option for cerebral ischemia with minimal systemic adverse effects that could limit their long term use. The scenario calls for extensive investigations which can result in the development of lead molecules for neuroprotection in the future. In this context, the present review focuses on possible mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of herbal drugs in patients with cerebral ischemic injury. Natural compounds have been demonstrated to have neurofunctional regulatory actions with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, calcium antagonizing and anti-apoptotic activities. Among the several leads obtained from plant sources as potential neuroprotective agents, resveratrol, EGb761, curcumin and epigallocatechin-3-gallate have shown significant therapeutic benefits in cerebral ischemic conditions. However, ligustilide, tanshinone, scutellarin and shikonin are the few lead molecules which are under investigation for treatment of cerebral ischemia.

25371590|t|Dietary supplements in the management of hypertension and diabetes - a review.
25371590|a|BACKGROUND: The use of alternative therapies like herbs and dietary supplements is very common among hypertensive and diabetic patients all over the globe. Hypertension is a silent disease that causes increase in cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, renal morbidity and mortality whereas diabetic complications cause heart attack, stroke, blindness and kidney disease. These are serious and chronic metabolic disorders that have a significant impact on the health, quality of life, and life expectancy of patients, as well as on the health care systems. Orthodox drugs used for the treatment of hypertension and diabetes produce side effects such as headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, weakness, fatigue and erectile dysfunction. The need for considering alternate therapies in the form of dietary supplements known to promote good health, having little or no side effects therefore arises. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was carried out using comprehensive and systematic literature reports on the concurrent use of dietary supplements in the management of diabetes and hypertension. Empirical searches were conducted using Google scholar (http://scholar.google.com), and Science Direct (http://www.sciencedirect.com). In addition to these databases, the University database was also used. Searches were also undertaken using keyword combinations such as dietary supplements and the names of the diseases in question. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: This review chronicled the therapeutic values of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fruits, vegetables, herbs and other botanicals used as dietary supplements. Results show that these supplements provided better and safe substitutes to toxic and expensive conventional drugs. Generally dietary supplements are free from major side effects, readily available and affordable. It is envisaged that the use of dietary supplement will promote good health and improve the status of hypertensive and diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: Medical doctors are therefore encouraged to incorporate dietary supplements into the regimen employed for hypertension and diabetes management.

25039192|a|To investigate the role of volatile components in the compound and to find the substance foundation of Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) for curing extremities spasticity after stroke. The chemical compositions of essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation from Gualou Guizhi decoction and its major constituting herbs (Trichosanthis Radix, Paeoniae Alba Radix, Cinnamomi Ramulus, Zingiberis Recens Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix, Ziziphi Jujubae Fructus) were analyzed by GC-MS to evaluate the correlativity between volatile components of GLGZD and its major constituting herbs, and volatile components after oral administration of GLGZD in the rats' brain. Volatile components of GLGZD are mainly derived from Cinnamomi Ramulus, Zingiberis Recens Rhizoma, Ziziphi Jujubae Fructus, Trichosanthis Radix. The volatile components in the brain is mostly derived from radix trichosanthis. Compared with individual herbs of GLGZD, the dissolution of the components increase or new components appear after compatibility of six herbs. Adminstrated with GLGZD, the results point out that volatile components in the brain play a neuroprotective role through passing the brain.

24642112|t|Social representation and practices related to dementia in Hai District of Tanzania.
24642112|a|BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of people surviving into old age in Africa, dementia is becoming an important public health problem. Understanding the social dynamics of dementia in resource-poor settings is critical for developing effective interventions. We explored the socio-cultural beliefs surrounding dementia and the life experience of people with dementia (PWD) and their caregivers in the Hai District of Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. METHODS: Cross-sectional qualitative design. Forty one PWD were purposively sampled from the Hai District of Kilimanjaro. Twenty five paired interviews with PWD and with caregivers, and 16 with caregivers alone, were conducted. Interviews were tape recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis approach. RESULTS: Forty one PWD (26 females), aged 70 years and older, were recruited but due to speech difficulties only 25 participated in the interviews. Married were 13, widow in 22 and widower 6. The majority, 33/41 were illiterate. PWD and carers perceived memory problems as a normal part of ageing. Dementia was commonly referred as "ugonjwa wa uzeeni" (disease of old people) or memory loss disease. The majority of PWD 13/12 and carers 7/16 did not know what dementia is or what causes it. Dementia was felt to be associated with stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, old age, curse/witchcraft and life stress. Half of the participants had used modern care and alternative care such as herbs, prayers or traditional healers. Caregivers complained about the burden of caring for PWD and suggested that community organizations should be involved in addressing the problem. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about dementia is low and the symptoms are accepted as a problem of old age. PWD and carers demonstrate pluralistic behaviour in seeking help from modern care, prayers and traditional healers. The disease adds significant burden to family members. Family and caregivers need more education on early recognition of symptoms and cost effective management of dementia at family level. Faith-based organizations could play an important role in dementia interventions. At a national level effective policy and improvement of the health care system to address the needs of PWD and their families are imperative.

24192211|t|Cerebral vasodilator properties of Danshen and Gegen: a study of their combined efficacy and mechanisms of actions.
24192211|a|Danshen and Gegen are two commonly used Chinese herbal medicines for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the combination effects of these two herbs on cerebral vascular tone and their underlying mechanisms of actions. Basilar artery rings were obtained from rats and precontracted with U46619. Cumulative administrations of aqueous extracts of Danshen, Gegen, or the two herbs combined (DG; ratio 7:3) produced concentration-dependent relaxation of the artery rings. Statistical analysis on these findings produced a combination index (CI) of 1.041 at ED50, which indicates the two herbs produced additive vasodilator effects when used as a combined decoction. Removal of the endothelium had no effect on the vasodilator properties of Danshen, Gegen, and DG. However, their maximum effects (Imax) were significantly blunted by a KATP channel inhibitor glibenclamide, a non-selective K(+) channel inhibitor tetraethylammonium (TEA), and by a combination of K(+) channel inhibitors (glibenclamide+TEA+iberiotoxin+4-aminopyridine+barium chloride). In addition, Danshen, Gegen, and DG produced augmentation of KATP currents and inhibited Ca(2+) influx in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from rat basilar arteries. Furthermore, these agents inhibited CaCl2-induced contraction in the artery rings. In conclusion, the present study showed that Danshen and Gegen produced additive vasodilator effects on rat cerebral basilar arteries. These effects were independent of endothelium-derived relaxant factors (EDRF), but required the opening of KATP channels and inhibition of Ca(2+) influx in the vascular smooth muscle cells. It is suspected that the cerebral vasodilator effects of Danshen and Gegen produced either on their own or in combination, can help patients with obstructive cerebrovascular diseases.

24051274|t|Neuroprotective effects of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction on ischemic stroke rats revealed by (1)H NMR metabolomics approach.
24051274|a|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) is a representative antipyretic and detoxifying recipe in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). This formula and its component herbs like Radix Scutellariae, Fructus Gardeniae show a variety of neuroprotective activities and have been used for the treatment of nervous system diseases including stroke. To comprehensively and holistically assess its therapeutic effect on ischemic stroke, a novel integrative metabolomics approach was applied. A rat ischemic stroke model was established by introduction of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. The neurological deficit, cerebral infarct size and morphological abnormality were evaluated. An NMR technique combined with appropriate statistical analyses was then performed to explore the metabonomic profiles of serum and brain tissue extracts. Pattern analysis of the (1)H NMR data disclosed that HLJDD could relieve stroke rats suffering from the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by ameliorating the disturbance in energy metabolism, membrane and mitochondrial metabolism, neurotransmitter and amino acid metabolism, alleviating the oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the inflammatory damage, and recovering the destructed osmoregulation.

24004049|t|Protective effects of ginseng total saponins against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury in experimental obstructive jaundice rats.
24004049|a|CONTEXT: Ginseng, the root of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Araliaceae), is one of the most extensively used herbs for stroke and chronic debilitating conditions in East Asian countries. Ginsenosides (GS) are the main bioactive compounds for ginseng's efficacy, but the mechanisms have not been fully clarified. OBJECTIVE: To investigate hepatoprotective effects of GS against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury in the experimental obstructive jaundice rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GS was fed to cholestatic rats with IR injury daily for 6 d at a dose of 1.10 g/kg. Levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined by colorimetric method. Apoptosis was measured quantitatively by the terminal transferase UTP nick end-labeling method. Protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: After intervention of GS to cholestatic rats with IR injury, the levels of activating blood flow were significantly improved, and the levels of serum ALT were decreased 1.7-times, AST decreased 1.3-times, but SOD activities were increased 1.1-times compared with those of the model rats. It could also reverse histopathological changes and inhibit IR-induced apoptosis of hepatic tissues via decrease of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (from 2.87 ± 0.57 to 1.65 ± 0.29). Oral administration of GS in a dosage of 26.4 g/kg did not lead to toxic effects in rats. CONCLUSION: GS attenuated the IR injury in the presence of cholestasis and could be considered for the clinical treatment of cholestasis.

The first recorded observations were in 2455 BC and it has been studied intensely by ancient physicians throughout history. In the early medieval period, Ibn Sina (980-1025 AD) called stroke sekteh and described it extensively. Some of Ibn Sina's definitions and his etiology of stroke are based on humoral theories and cannot be compared with medical current concepts, but most of his descriptions concur with current definitions. This review examines the definition and etiology, clinical manifestations, prognosis, differential diagnosis, and interventions for stroke based on Ibn Sina's epic work, Canon of Medicine. The pharmacological effects of medicinal herbs suggested by Ibn Sina for stroke are examined in light of current knowledge.

24348193|t|Pharmacological effects of active compounds on neurodegenerative disease with gastrodia and uncaria decoction, a commonly used poststroke decoction.
24348193|a|Neurodegenerative diseases refer to the selective loss of neuronal systems in patients. The diseases cause high morbidity and mortality to approximately 22 million people worldwide and the number is expected to be tripled by 2050. Up to now, there is no effective prevention and treatment for the neurodegenerative diseases. Although some of the clinical therapies target at slowing down the progression of symptoms of the diseases, the general effectiveness of the drugs has been far from satisfactory. Traditional Chinese medicine becomes popular alternative remedies as it has been practiced clinically for more than thousands of years in China. As neurodegenerative diseases are mediated through different pathways, herbal decoction with multiple herbs is used as an effective therapeutic approach to work on multiple targets. Gastrodia and Uncaria Decoction, a popular TCM decoction, has been used to treat stroke in China. The decoction contains compounds including alkaloids, flavonoids, iridoids, carotenoids, and natural phenols, which have been found to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiapoptotic effects. In this review, we will summarize the recent publications of the pharmacological effects of these five groups of compounds. Understanding the mechanisms of action of these compounds may provide new treatment opportunities for the patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

24083830|t|A case report of adult lead toxicity following use of Ayurvedic herbal medication.
24083830|a|INTRODUCTION: Ayurvedic medications consist of herbs that may be intentionally combined with metals, such as lead, mercury, iron, and zinc. Ayurvedic practitioners and their patients believe that the toxic properties of the metals are reduced or eliminated during preparation and processing. CASE REPORT: A 69 year old Caucasian male retired professional with a prior history of stroke presented for evaluation of new onset depression, fatigue, generalized weakness, constipation, anorexia, and weight loss. History revealed that his symptoms were temporally related to initiation of an Ayurvedic herbal medication. The patient had been previously admitted to another hospital for these symptoms and was found to have a severe anemia for which no etiology was found. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated blood lead level and a diagnosis of symptomatic lead toxicity was made. The patient was treated with intramuscular, intravenous, and oral chelation therapy to promote lead excretion. Because of complaints of continued poor mental function, neuropsychological tests were administered before and after one of the chelation treatments and showed improvement in measures of attention and other cognitive domains. In addition, the patient was able to discontinue use of antidepressant medication after chelation. DISCUSSION: A high index of suspicion of metal toxicity is necessary among persons with characteristic symptoms and signs in the absence of occupational exposure. Despite limited evidence for chelation in adults and in those with modest blood lead levels, this patient appeared to benefit from repeated chelation therapy. Both allopathic and alternative medicine practitioners and public health specialists need to be aware of the potential for contamination of and side effects from alternative pharmacologic and herbal therapies.

23989686|t|Anti-inflammatory effects of total isoflavones from Pueraria lobata on cerebral ischemia in rats.
23989686|a|Puerariae radix, the dried root of Pueraria lobata Ohwi, is one of earliest and most important edible crude herbs used for various medical purposes in Oriental medicine. The aim of the present study was to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of Total Isoflavones from P. lobata (TIPL), which contains the unique isoflavone puerarin, in ischemia in vivo models. Oral administration of TIPL (100 mg/kg) reduced the brain infarct volume and attenuated ischemia-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) up-regulation at 2 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in rats. Moreover, TIPL reduced activation of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and CD11b antibody (OX-42) at 7 days after MCAo in hippocampal CA1 region. These results show that TIPL can protect the brain from ischemic damage after MCAo. Regarding the immunohistochemical study, the effects of TIPL may be attributable to its anti-inflammatory properties by the inhibition of COX-2 expression, astrocyte expression, and microglia.

23819225|t|[Observation on the clinical efficacy of shoulder pain in post-stroke shoulder-hand syndrome treated with floating acupuncture and rehabilitation training].
23819225|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy difference in the treatment of shoulder pain in post-stroke shoulder-hand syndrome among floating acupuncture, oral administration of western medicine and local fumigation of Chinese herbs. METHODS: Ninety cases of post-stroke shoulder-hand syndrome (stage I) were randomized into a floating acupuncture group, a western medicine group and a local Chinese herbs fumigation group, 30 cases in each one. In the floating acupuncture group, two obvious tender points were detected on the shoulder and the site 80-100 mm inferior to each tender point was taken as the inserting point and stimulated with floating needling technique. In the western medicine group, mobic 7.5 mg was prescribed for oral administration. In the local Chinese herbs fumigation group, the formula for activating blood circulation and relaxing tendon was used for local fumigation. All the patients in three groups received rehabilitation training. The floating acupuncture, oral administration of western medicine, local Chinese herbs fumigation and rehabilitation training were given once a day respectively in corresponding group and the cases were observed for 1 month. The visual analogue scale (VAS) and Takagishi shoulder joint function assessment were adopted to evaluate the dynamic change of the patients with shoulder pain before and after treatment in three groups. The modified Barthel index was used to evaluate the dynamic change of daily life activity of the patients in three groups. RESULTS: With floating acupuncture, shoulder pain was relieved and the daily life activity was improved in the patients with post-stroke shoulder-hand syndrome, which was superior to the oral administration of western medicine and local Chinese herbs fumigation (P < 0.01). With local Chinese herbs fumigation, the improvement of shoulder pain was superior to the oral administration of western medicine. The difference in the improvement of daily life activity was not significant statistically between the local Chinese herbs fumigation and oral administration of western medicine, the efficacy was similar between these two therapies (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The floating acupuncture relieves shoulder pain of the patients with post-stroke shoulder-hand syndrome promptly and effectively, and the effects on shoulder pain and the improvements of daily life activity are superior to that of the oral administration of western medicine and local Chinese herbs fumigation.

23092406|t|Beneficial effects of herbs, spices and medicinal plants on the metabolic syndrome, brain and cognitive function.
23092406|a|Herbs and spices have been used since ancient times to not only improve the flavor of edible food but also to prevent and treat chronic health maladies. While the scientific evidence for the use of such common herbs and medicinal plants then had been scarce or lacking, the beneficial effects observed from such use were generally encouraging. It is, therefore, not surprising that the tradition of using such herbs, perhaps even after the advent of modern medicine, has continued. More recently, due to an increased interest in understanding the nutritional effects of herbs/spices more comprehensively, several studies have examined the cellular and molecular modes of action of the active chemical components in herbs and their biological properties. Beneficial actions of herbs/spices include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, gluco-regulatory, and anti-thrombotic effects. One major component of herbs and spices is the polyphenols. Some of the aforementioned properties are attributed to the polyphenols and they are associated with attenuating the metabolic syndrome. Detrimental changes associated with the metabolic syndrome over time affect brain and cognitive function. Metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes are also risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and stroke. In addition, the neuroprotective effects of herbs and spices have been demonstrated and, whether directly or indirectly, such beneficial effects may also contribute to an improvement in cognitive function. This review evaluates the current evidence available for herbs/spices in potentially improving the metabolic syndrome, as well as their neuroprotective effects on the brain, and cognitive function in animal and human studies.

23001461|t|Inhibitory effects of Qushuanling Capsule () on thrombus formation and platelet aggregation in rats.
23001461|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Qushuanling Capsule ( QSLC) on thrombus formation and platelet aggregation in rats. METHODS: Arteriovenous bypass, venous thrombosis, and middle cerebral artery thrombosis models were used in rats to investigate the anti-thrombotic effects of QSLC, a compound of nine Chinese herbs. The platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin or arachidonic acid (AA), as well as the contents of thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α (6-keto-PGF1α) in rat plasma and aortic walls, were determined to investigate the possible mechanisms of the anti-thrombotic effects of QSLC. RESULTS: After oral administration with QSLC for 7 days, arteriovenous bypass thrombosis was obviously suppressed compared with the model group, venous thrombosis was also obviously suppressed, rat behaviors were obviously improved, and brain infarct size as well as water content were also reduced. The platelet aggregation induced by ADP or thrombin was inhibited by QSLC, but the drug had no effect on AA-induced platelet aggregation and content of TXB(2) and 6-keto-PGF1α in plasma and the aortic wall. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that QSLC can be used in the prevention and treatment of thrombotic diseases, and that its mechanism of action may be related to inhibition of platelet aggregation.

22568853|t|Burden of stroke in the Philippines.
22568853|a|Based on disability-adjusted life-years, stroke is the second leading cause of death and among the top five diseases with the greatest burden. Although two community-based studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence of stroke in the Philippines, the incidence has not been nationally recorded to date. The prevalence ranged from 1·9% to 6·59%, and 'Wiihabilitation', a rehabilitation stroke therapy, is widely practiced. A clinical trial for stroke rehabilitation using the Chinese Medicine NeuroAid®, which consists of several herbs, is ongoing in many hospitals across the Philippines. Due to their ready availability, phytomedicines are widely used, especially in the rural areas, for the treatment of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia, which are predisposing factors for stroke in the Philippines. Due to the increasing number of stroke cases annually, the government of the Philippines should emphasize primary and secondary prevention strategies.

23427407|t|Effect of tonifying liver and kidney-essence herbs on expression of Nogo-A and p75(NTR) in cerebral ischemic stroke rats model.
23427407|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of tonifying liver and kidney-essence herbs on expression of a nerve regeneration inhibitor, Nogo for neuron A (Nogo-A), and its associated signaling molecule, low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75(NTR)), in rats with cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS), with the aim of exploring the possible mechanism of tonifying liver and kidney-essence herbs in recovery following injury to the central nervous system. METHODS: A cerebral ischemic stroke model in SD rats was established with the suture-occlusion method. Successful model rats were divided into placebo and herb groups at random; sham-operated and control groups were set up simultaneously. Each of these groups was divided into six subgroups at random. Expression of Nogo-A and p75(NTR) was evaluated with immunofluorescence microscopy at days 3, and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 after administration. RESULTS: Tonifying liver and kidney-essence herbs suppressed the expression of Nogo-A and p75(NTR) (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Suppressing the expression of Nogo-A and p75(NTR) is possibly one of the mechanisms underlying the ability of tonifying liver and kidney-essence herbs to promote recovery of the injured central nervous system.

23285944|a|Dengzhanxixin injection is extracted from herbs of Erigeron breviscapusis. Its function includes activate blood, dispel stasis, unblock the collaterals and relieve pain. In clinical, it is widely used for static blood obstruction, wind-stroke and hemiplegia, numbness of limbs, deviated eyes and mouth, dysphasia, chest impediment, heart pain, ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, and angina pectoris with the pattern mentioned above. In this paper, we planed to review the pharmacological and toxicological effects of Dengzhanxixin injection from relevant studies.

22562327|t|[Ginkgo biloba--effect, adverse events and drug interaction].
22562327|a|Ginkgo is probably one of the most widely used medicinal herbs in Europe. In Norway products of ginkgo leaf extract have been approved by the Norwegian Medicines Agency for the following indication: traditionally used to improve blood circulation, for example, cold hands and feet. Elsewhere, ginkgo is used for cognitive impairment and dementia, acute ischaemic stroke, intermittent claudication, tinnitus and age-related macular degeneration. Evidence of the efficacy of ginkgo for these indications has previously been studied by the Cochrane Collaboration. In this update we have repeated all the searches in Medline and EMBASE exactly as described in the five Cochrane Systematic Reviews (last search date: 16.02.2011). We identified two new randomised and placebo-controlled studies on cognitive impairment and dementia (3187 patients) and one study on acute ischaemic stroke (3069 patients). The results of these studies gave no reason to change the conclusions of earlier reviews by the Cochrane Collaboration. There is no convincing evidence that ginkgo is effective for cognitive impairment or dementia, acute ischaemic stroke, intermittent claudication or tinnitus. There is still a lack of conclusive evidence for the effect on age-related macular degeneration. Ginkgo leaf extract appears to be safe to use, with no excess side effects compared with placebo. It can cause some minor side effects such as stomach upset, headache, dizziness, constipation, forceful heartbeat, and allergic skin reactions. There is some concern that ginkgo leaf extract might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding, and interactions with anticoagulants/antiplatelet drugs cannot be ruled out. As a general precaution, it is recommended withdrawing ginkgo two weeks before elective surgery.

22100334|t|Experimental evidence of Ginkgo biloba extract EGB as a neuroprotective agent in ischemia stroke rats.
22100334|a|EGb761 is a standard extract of Ginkgo biloba, which is a kind of traditional Chinese herbs that has widely used in clinic treatment of stroke in China. However, its effects against ischemic stroke have not been evaluated comprehensively and its neuroprotective mechanism has not really been explored. In the present study, magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), neurological behavior and TTC staining were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of EGb761 in rat ischemic models. Additionally, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were performed to measure the phosphorylations of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and Akt as well as the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rat brains. The results showed that Ginkgo biloba extract injection significantly increased the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value and average diffusion coefficient (DCavg) value both in the peripheral zone and central zone, improved behavior scores, as well as enhanced the phosphorylations of AKT, CREB and the expression of BDNF in the brains. All these data demonstrate that EGb761 had significant therapeutic effects on ischemic stroke and it perhaps worked through activating the Akt-CREB-BDNF pathway.

23118787|t|Systems biology of meridians, acupoints, and chinese herbs in disease.
23118787|a|Meridians, acupoints, and Chinese herbs are important components of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). They have been used for disease treatment and prevention and as alternative and complementary therapies. Systems biology integrates omics data, such as transcriptional, proteomic, and metabolomics data, in order to obtain a more global and complete picture of biological activity. To further understand the existence and functions of the three components above, we reviewed relevant research in the systems biology literature and found many recent studies that indicate the value of acupuncture and Chinese herbs. Acupuncture is useful in pain moderation and relieves various symptoms arising from acute spinal cord injury and acute ischemic stroke. Moreover, Chinese herbal extracts have been linked to wound repair, the alleviation of postmenopausal osteoporosis severity, and anti-tumor effects, among others. Different acupoints, variations in treatment duration, and herbal extracts can be used to alleviate various symptoms and conditions and to regulate biological pathways by altering gene and protein expression. Our paper demonstrates how systems biology has helped to establish a platform for investigating the efficacy of TCM in treating different diseases and improving treatment strategies.

22545124|t|Direct stimulation of adult neural stem/progenitor cells in vitro and neurogenesis in vivo by salvianolic acid B.
22545124|a|BACKGROUND: Small molecules have been shown to modulate the neurogenesis processes. In search for new therapeutic drugs, the herbs used in traditional medicines for neurogenesis are promising candidates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We selected a total of 45 natural compounds from Traditional Chinese herbal medicines which are extensively used in China to treat stroke clinically, and tested their proliferation-inducing activities on neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). The screening results showed that salvianolic acid B (Sal B) displayed marked effects on the induction of proliferation of NSPCs. We further demonstrated that Sal B promoted NSPCs proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manners. To explore the molecular mechanism, PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK and Notch signaling pathways were investigated. Cell proliferation assay demonstrated that Ly294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor), but neither U0126 (ERK inhibitor) nor DAPT (Notch inhibitor) inhibited the Sal B-induced proliferation of cells. Western Blotting results showed that stimulation of NSPCs with Sal B enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt, and Ly294002 abolished this effect, confirming the role of Akt in Sal B mediated proliferation of NSPCs. Rats exposed to transient cerebral ischemia were treated for 4 weeks with Sal B from the 7th day after stroke. BrdU incorporation assay results showed that exposure Sal B could maintain the proliferation of NSPCs after cerebral ischemia. Morris water maze test showed that delayed post-ischemic treatment with Sal B improved cognitive impairment after stroke in rats. SIGNIFICANCE: Sal B could maintain the NSPCs self-renew and promote proliferation, which was mediated by PI3K/Akt signal pathway. And delayed post-ischemic treatment with Sal B improved cognitive impairment after stroke in rats. These findings suggested that Sal B may act as a potential drug in treatment of brain injury or neurodegenerative diseases.

21893393|t|Comparative pharmacokinetics of three marker compounds in mBHT and single-herb extract after oral administration to rats.
21893393|a|Modified Bo-Yang-Hwan-O-Tang (mBHT) is a decoction of 12 herbs traditionally used in the treatment of cerebral and cardiac stroke and vascular dementia. Paeoniflorin (PF), calycosin-7-O-β-D-glycoside (CY), and salvianolic acid B (SB) are marker compounds for extracts of the herbs Paeoniae Radix, Astragali Radix, and Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix, respectively, and are used to assess the quality of mBHT. This study examined the pharmacokinetics of these three marker compounds following oral administration of each herb extract alone and in combination as mBHT in rats. The concentrations of the three compounds in rat plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, using a C18 column (2.1×150 mm, 5 μm) and mobile phases of methanol-water-formic acid (10:90:0.05, v/v) and methanol-water (90:10, v/v). The results indicated that the pharmacokinetic parameters of Paeoniae Radix extract group and mBHT group were very similar, while those of Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix extract group and mBHT group were significantly different (P<0.05, t-test). The T(max), AUC and T(1/2) of SB for Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix extract group were 54.7 min, 598.7 μg min/ml and 37.4 min, respectively. However, these values increased to 77.6 min, 915.9 μg min/ml and 53.7 min for mBHT group, supposing that excretion of SB could be more retarded when administered in mBHT than in Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix extract.

21843615|t|Role of Ocimum basilicum L. in prevention of ischemia and reperfusion-induced cerebral damage, and motor dysfunctions in mice brain.
21843615|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The genus Ocimum (Lamiaceae) has a long history of use as culinary and medicinal herbs. Many species are used for their antioxidant and neuroprotective activity in various parts of the world. Ocimum basilicum Linn. has been used traditionally for the treatment of anxiety, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, headaches, nerve pain, as anticonvulsant and anti-inflammatory, and used in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study is designed to investigate the effect of ethyl acetate extract of Ocimum basilicum leaves on ischemia and reperfusion-induced cerebral damage, and motor dysfunctions in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Global cerebral ischemia was induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion for 15 min followed by reperfusion for 24h. Cerebral infarct size was measured using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) content was determined by colorimetric assay. Short-term memory was evaluated using elevated plus-maze. Inclined beam walking was employed to assess motor coordination. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by reperfusion produced significant increase in cerebral infarct size and lipid peroxidation (TBARS), and reduced GSH content, and impaired short-term memory and motor coordination. RESULTS: Pre-treatment with standardized ethyl acetate extract of Ocimum basilicum (100 and 200mg/kg, p.o.) markedly reduced cerebral infarct size and lipid peroxidation, restored GSH content, and attenuated impairment in short-term memory and motor coordination. CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest that Ocimum basilicum could be useful clinically in the prevention of stroke.

21762767|t|A modified formulation of Chinese traditional medicine improves memory impairment and reduces Aβ level in the Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
21762767|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: SuHeXiang Wan (SHXW), a Chinese traditional medicine has been used orally for the treatment of seizures, infantile convulsion, stroke and so forth. Previously, we reported the effects of modified SHXW essential oil mixture of the fragrance containing herbs on the sedative effect, anticonvulsant property and antioxidative activity after fragrance inhalation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was undertaken to evaluate beneficial effects of a modified recipe of SHXW (termed as KSOP1009) consisting of a ethanol extract of 8 herbs including resin of Liquidambar orientalis Miller, seed of Myristica fragrans Houtt., rhizome of Cnidium officinale Makino, lumber of Santalum album L., fructus of Piper longum L., flower buds of Eugenia caryophyllata Merrill et Perry, pollen of Typha orientalis Presl., and root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge in the neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The transgenic mice of AD, Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9, were fed KSOP1009 or as a positive control, donepezil for 3 months from 4.5 months of age. Behavioral, immunological and ELISA analyses were used to assess memory impairment, Aβ accumulation and plaque deposition in the brain. Other in vitro works were performed to examine whether KSOP1009 inhibits the Aβ(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y cells. RESULTS: Intake of KSOP1009 improved the Aβ-induced memory impairment and suppressed Aβ levels and plaque deposition in the brain of Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9 mice as much as that of donepezil treatment. KSOP1009 prevented the down-regulation of phospho-CREB and increased AKT phosphorylation in the AD-like brains. Moreover, KSOP1009 suppresses Aβ-induced apoptosis and ROS production in SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that KSOP1009 may develop as a therapeutic drug for treatment of AD patients.

22046815|t|[Interactions between oral anticoagulants and other medication in emergency department--a pharmacoepidemiologic approach].
22046815|a|Oral anticoagulants (OAC) are commonly used as a life-long therapy in the prevention of systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, prosthetic heart valves, and in the primary and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism, in patients with acute myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. Drugs, herbs, and multivitamin supplements can alter the absorption, pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of OAC.AIM: To investigate the possible interactions between oral anticoagulants and different drugs administered in patients in emergency department. METHODS: This 1-year exploratory investigation on 93 patients on OAC (aged 30 - 85 years), admitted at two emergency departments of the Iasi "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital and Piatra Neamţ Hospital, consisted in their medical records analysis: diagnosis, recommended treatement. Data were scored and statistically analyzed by t-test (Windows Excel). The experimental protocol was in agreement with the recommendations of the Gr.T. Popa University Committee for Research and Ethical Issues. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Analysis and statistical processing of data shows that during the study period 56 patients which received oral anticoagulant therapy associated with different other medication belonged to the 60 and 80 years age group. This finding suggests that the pathology is represented especially by atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction. The correlation between the therapy consisting in OAC and sartan or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and International Normalized Ratio (INR), revealed a high level of anticoagulation and an increase in hemorragic complications.

21492172|t|Amelioration of cerebral infarction and improvement of neurological deficit by a Korean herbal medicine, modified Bo-Yang-Hwan-O-Tang.
21492172|a|OBJECTIVES: Modified Bo-Yang-Hwan-O-Tang (mBHT) is an improved herbal formula of BHT, which has been widely used to treat ischaemic stroke in East Asia, by the addition of five herbs having anti-ischaemic properties. In this study, we investigated whether mBHT would reduce cerebral ischaemic injury in rats. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and subsequent 22-h reperfusion. mBHT was administered either intraperitoneally twice 15 min before and 15 min after, or orally once 30 min or 120 min after the onset of MCAO (50 or 200 mg/kg each). KEY FINDINGS: Intraperitoneal administration of mBHT markedly reduced the cerebral infarct size and neurological deficit caused by MCAO/reperfusion. mBHT treatment also significantly improved long-term survival rate after cerebral ischaemic injury. Oral administration of mBHT 30 min after ischaemia also markedly reduced the infarct size after cerebral ischaemia. The anti-ischaemic effect of mBHT was significantly, but not fully, reduced when mBHT-induced hypothermia was abolished. In cultured cortical neurons, we further found that mBHT decreased oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation-evoked neuronal injury by inhibiting production of reactive oxygen species, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and activation of caspase-3. However, mBHT did not inhibit N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that mBHT has multiple anti-ischaemic properties and would be a good therapeutic herbal prescription for the treatment of cerebral ischaemic stroke.

21146552|t|Isolation and identification of anti-inflammatory constituents from Ligusticum chuanxiong and their underlying mechanisms of action on microglia.
21146552|a|Stroke is the third most common cause of death worldwide. Recent findings showed that the severity of cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic stroke correlates with inflammation mediated responses in the neural cells. During ischemia, inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and nitric oxide are produced by microglia, which play a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Ligusticum chuanxiong (LCX) is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for empiric treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases for many centuries. By applying a bioactivity-guided fractionation scheme, two compounds with inhibition on neuroinflammation were isolated from LCX. Using chromatographic and spectrometric methods, they were identified to be senkyunolide A and Z-ligustilide. They could inhibit the production of proinflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine BV-2 microglial cells and human peripheral blood monocyte derived macrophages. In addition, both compounds protected Neuro-2a cells from neuroinflammatory toxicity induced by the conditioned culture media produced by LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. The underlying mechanisms of action of senkyunolide A were further delineated. Its inhibitory effects were shown to be independent of the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). However, senkyunolide A could increase the degradation of TNF-α mRNA and reduce its half life by 43%. In conclusion, bioactivity-guided fractionation is an effective way of isolating bioactive compounds from medicinal herbs. In addition, senkyunolide A and Z-ligustilide isolated from LCX may be considered as potential complementary drug candidates for treating inflammatory processes associated with cerebrovascular diseases.

21333721|t|Neuroprotective effect of SuHeXiang Wan in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease.
21333721|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: SuHeXiang Wan (SHXW) is a Chinese traditional medicinal prescription that consists of 15 crude herbs. SHXW has been used to treat central nervous depression, seizures, infantile convulsion and stroke, and its essential oil has been shown to have anticonvulsant and antioxidative activity. The goal of this study was to investigate the beneficial effects of SHXW on the neurological phenotypes of Drosophila AD models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the effects of a modified SHXW (called KSOP1009) intake on the AD-like phenotypes of Drosophila AD models, which express human Aβ42 in their developing eyes or neurons. RESULTS: When the flies were kept on the media containing 5 μg/ml of KSOP1009 extract, Aβ42-induced eye degeneration, apoptosis, and the locomotive dysfunctions were strongly suppressed. However, Aβ42 fibril deposits in the Aβ42 overexpressing model were not affected by treatment with KSOP1009 extract. Conversely, KSOP1009 extract intake significantly suppressed the constitutive active form of hemipterous, a JNK activator, while it induced eye degeneration and JNK activation, which has been recognized as an important mediator of Aβ42-associated neuro-cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that KSOP1009 confers a therapeutic potential to AD-like pathology of Aβ42 overexpressing Drosophila model via suppression of the hyperactivation of JNK activity and apoptosis.

21073942|t|Ginseng total saponins enhance neurogenesis after focal cerebral ischemia.
21073942|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ginseng, the root of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, is one of the most commonly used healing herbs for stroke and chronic debilitating conditions in China. Ginsenosides are the main active principles for ginseng's efficacy, but the mechanisms have not been fully clarified. AIM OF THE STUDY: To test the hypothesis whether or not the administration of Ginseng total saponins (GTS) can enhance neurogenesis after focal cerebral ischemia, and thereby improve neurological deficits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats received intraperitoneal injections of GTS dissolved at a dose of 25 mg kg(-1) d(-1) or normal saline (NS) of same volume 3 days before the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model establishment until the animals were killed at the time points of 1d, 3d, 7d and 14d. The neurological function was assessed blindly. BrdU immunostaining and double staining were performed by following the 3-steps method. RESULTS: (A) GTS-treated rats have better neurological scores compared with those in NS group at 14d time point (p<0.05); (B) the number of BrdU(+) cells and BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells in GTS group were significantly higher than those in NS group in the ipsilateral subventricular zone and in the ipsilateral infarct area after MCAO, respectively (p<0.05 or p<0.01); (C) the increase of the number of BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells highly correlated with the decrease of neurological scores. Coefficient correlation r=-0.828 (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: GTS can improve neurological deficits after focal cerebral ischemia by inducing endogenous neural stem cells activation and thereby enhance adult central nervous system regeneration.

21905282|t|SuHeXiang Wan essential oil alleviates amyloid beta induced memory impairment through inhibition of tau protein phosphorylation in mice.
21905282|a|SuHeXiang Wan (SHXW), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used orally for the treatment of seizures, infantile convulsions and stroke. Previously, we reported the effects of a modified SHXW essential oil in terms of sedative effect, anticonvulsant activity and antioxidative activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of SHXW essential oil in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). SHXW essential oil was extracted from nine herbs. The mouse AD model was induced by a single injection of amyloid β protein (Aβ(1-42)) into the hippocampus. The animals were divided into four groups, the negative control group injected with Aβ(42-1), the Aβ group injected with Aβ(1-42), the SHXW group inhaled SHXW essential oil and received Aβ(1-42) injection, and the positive control group administered with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 10 mg/kg) and with subsequent Aβ(1-42) injection. Mice were analyzed by behavioral tests and immunological examination in the hippocampus. An additional in vitro investigation was performed to examine whether SHXW essential oil inhibits Aβ(1-42) induced neurotoxicity in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y cells. Pre-inhalation of SHXW essential oil improved the Aβ(1-42) induced memory impairment and suppressed Aβ(1-42) induced JNK, p38 and Tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus. SHXW essential oil suppressed Aβ-induced apoptosis and ROS production via an up-regulation of HO-1 and Nrf2 expression in SH-SY5Y cells. The present study suggests that SHXW essential oil may have potential as a therapeutic inhalation drug for the prevention and treatment of AD.

22096316|t|Role of natural herbs in the treatment of hypertension.
22096316|a|Hypertension (HTN) is the medical term for high blood pressure. It is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard and contributes to atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries), besides increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. HTN can also lead to other conditions such as congestive heart failure, kidney disease, and blindness. Conventional antihypertensives are usually associated with many side effects. About 75 to 80% of the world population use herbal medicines, mainly in developing countries, for primary health care because of their better acceptability with human body and lesser side effects. In the last three decades, a lot of concerted efforts have been channeled into researching the local plants with hypotensive and antihypertensive therapeutic values. The hypotensive and antihypertensive effects of some of these medicinal plants have been validated and others disproved. However, ayurvedic knowledge needs to be coupled with modern medicine and more scientific research needs to be done to verify the effectiveness, and elucidate the safety profile of such herbal remedies for their antihypertensive potential.

21117445|t|Gaso-transmitter hydrogen sulphide: potential new target in pharmacotherapy.
21117445|a|Research in the last two decades has transformed the way hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is perceived from a noxious gas to a gaso-transmitter with a vast potential in pharmacotherapy. H2S is synthesized in various body-systems using the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase; either of these being the predominat enzyme in a particular system. H2S may be one of the physiological modulators of blood pressure in humans. The gas relaxes the vascular smooth muscle cells by opening up K(ATP) channels. Moreover, it suppresses the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. H2S may also be contributing in the protection afforded by ischaemia-preconditioning. Testosterone is thought to be responsible for the higher central nervous system level of H2S in males. In the central nervous system, H2S is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, stroke and Down's syndrome. Insulin secretion is associated with a decrease in the H2S levels. Raised H2S is detrimental in acute pancreatitis as well as in septic shock. Recently, H2S-releasing derivatives of certain drugs have shown promise in protection against gastric ulcer and in inflammatory bowel disease. The beneficial effects of certain sulphur containing herbs like ginseng and garlic may be mediated via H2S. In future, development of specific drugs modulating H2S levels may prove beneficial in varied disorders.

20947850|t|Leonurine protects middle cerebral artery occluded rats through antioxidant effect and regulation of mitochondrial function.
20947850|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oxidative stress is known to be involved in ischemic stroke. Intense interest is drawn to the therapeutic potential of Chinese herbs on ischemic stroke because many of them contain antioxidant properties. Leonurine, 1 of the active compounds from purified Herba Leonuri, was studied to evaluate its possible therapeutic effects on ischemic stroke. Method-Middle cerebral artery occlusion was selected as our model of study. The animals were pretreated with Leonurine orally for 7 days and the surgery was done. One day after surgery, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and neurological deficit score were carried out to evaluate the functional outcome of animals, whereas levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde were analyzed for oxidative stress analysis. For mitochondrial studies, 3 hours after surgery, mitochondria were isolated for analysis of reactive oxygen species production, adenosine triphosphate biosynthesis, oxygen consumption, and respiratory control ratio value. Result-In in vivo experiments, Leonurine pretreatment reduced infarct volume, improved neurological deficit in stroke groups, increased activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, and decreased levels from the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde. In terms of mitochondrial modulation, Leonurine inhibited mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and adenosine triphosphate biosynthesis. Animal studies also demonstrated that the mitochondrial function and redox state were restored by Leonurine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Leonurine has neuroprotective effects and carries a therapeutic potential of stroke prevention.

21056842|t|A pilot study in acute subarachnoid haemorrhagic patients after aneurysm clipping with complementary therapies of Chinese medicine.
21056842|a|OBJECTIVES: Acute subarachnoid haemorrhage still has high mortality and morbidity despite the use of modern standard treatment. In Taiwan, complementary therapies of Chinese medicine are usually used to treat stroke patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of complementary therapies of Chinese medicine on patients with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage after aneurysm clipping. DESIGN: This study was designed as a pilot study. A total of 32 patients with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage were randomly assigned to either a Chinese herbs extra group (CH) in which the patients were given complementary therapies of Chinese medicine and standard treatment, or a standard treatment only group (ST) in which patients were given standard treatment only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glasgow Outcome Scale scores, which were assessed by an evaluator who was blinded to the groups, 3 months after admission, and total admission days including intensive care unit stay days. RESULTS: The average Glasgow Outcome Scale score 3 months after admission was 3.7±1.4 in the CH was greater than 3.0±1.7 in the ST (p=0.041). Average total admission days were 53.9±28.6 (median 61) in the ST longer than 28.1±19.1 (median 20.5) in the CH (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage is of value because they can increase Glasgow Outcome Scale scores 3 months after admission and also because they can reduce total admission days.

20561929|t|The vasoprotective effect of JP05 through the activation of PI3K/Akt-dependent eNOS and MEK/ERK pathways in brain endothelial cells.
20561929|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: Endothelial dysfunction is involved in stroke. Recent therapeutic options for stroke have focused on the combination therapy with a polyherbal mixture. This study was designed to provide insight into the effects of JP05, a water extract of 12 herbs, on the levels of regulators in bEnd.3 mouse brain endothelial cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-mediated nitric oxide (NO), the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the phosphorylations of eNOS, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in JP05 were assayed in bEnd.3 cells, a mouse brain endothelial line. RESULTS: JP05 led to increase the levels of eNOS-mediated NO generation and VEGF expression in bEnd.3 cells. JP05 induced the phosphorylation of eNOS, Akt and ERK in bEnd.3 cells. As well, JP05 blocked the inhibition of PI3K/Akt and ERK activities by LY294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor) and PD98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor), respectively. JP05 also induced the phosphorylation of CREB, which plays an important role in endothelial cell function and blood vessel development. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results indicate that JP05 can upregulate eNOS-mediated NO generation and VEGF expression through the ERK and/or PI3K/Akt activation, an upstream event of angiogenesis. JP05 with vasoprotective properties has a potential therapy for human brain diseases including stroke.

20148407|t|Neuroprotective effect of HT008-1, a prescription of traditional Korean medicine, on transient focal cerebral ischemia model in rats.
20148407|a|HT008-1 is one of the prescriptions used in Traditional Korean Medicine for the treatment of mental and physical weakness. It is composed of Panax ginseng, Acanthopanax senticosus, Angelica sinensis and Scutellaria baicalensis, which have been reported to have various pharmacological effects on the central nervous system. The study investigated whether HT008-1 has neuroprotective effects in a focal cerebral ischemia rat model. Stroke was induced in rats by 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) followed by 22 h of reperfusion. HT008-1 (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg) and the component herbs (300 mg/kg) were administered orally twice at 0 and 2 h after ischemia. Oral administration of 300 mg/kg HT008-1 reduced brain infarction by 45.7%, prolonged the latency time by 24.8% in the rotarod test, and enhanced the score by 17.0% in the balance beam test. Only P. ginseng and S. baicalensis showed protective effects, and HT008-1 showed a greater effect than its component herbs. HT008-1 down-regulated the COX-2 and OX-42 expression in the penumbra region. In conclusion, the results show that HT008-1 may be effective in a rat stroke model by an antiinflammatory mechanism and may improve sensory-motor function by reducing damage in the cortex and caudoputamen.

20456840|t|Characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine syndromes in post-stroke depression.
20456840|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the main characteristics of syndromes in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in post-stroke depression (PSD) and to provide basis for treatments with TCM herbs. METHODS: According to diagnostic criteria of PSD, stroke patients and depression patients from Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital, Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were assigned into cerebral stroke group (150 cases), depression group (151 cases) and PSD group (123 cases). Neuropsychological assessments and imaging and biochemical analyses were conducted. TCM syndrome differentiation for these diseases was performed. We also determined the characteristics of TCM syndromes of PSD, relative risk of the syndromes and their correlations with ages as well. RESULTS: Scores of qi stagnation and blood stasis, liver qi depression, and transformation of fire due to qi stagnation in PSD group were significant higher than those in cerebral stroke group (P<0.05, P<0.01). In cerebral stroke group, majority of the patients displayed one syndrome, while in PSD and depression groups, the patients had three or more syndromes. Of these syndromes, the incidence rate of syndrome of liver qi depression complicated with transformation of fire due to qi stagnation or flaring of fire due to yin deficiency was high. The syndrome of liver qi depression occurred much more frequently in PSD group and depression group than in cerebral stroke group (P<0.05, P<0.01). The logistic regression analysis showed that the syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis had high relative risk to PSD. The syndrome of deficiency of heart and spleen was positively correlated with age in cerebral stroke group. CONCLUSION: The main TCM syndromes of PSD and depression are qi stagnation and blood stasis, liver qi depression, and transformation of fire due to qi stagnation. The syndrome of deficiency of heart and spleen is closely related to age among the stroke patients. The syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis serves as an independent risk factor for PSD. The more complicated the syndromes are, the more serious depression becomes.

20438664|t|Active compounds in Chinese herbs and medicinal animal products which promote blood circulation via inhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase.
20438664|a|The therapeutic effect of cardiac glycosides for congestive heart failure lies in their reversible inhibition on Na+, K+-ATPase located in human myocardium. Several steroid-like compounds containing a core structure similar to cardiac glycosides have been found in many Chinese herbs and medicinal animal products conventionally used to promote blood circulation. They are putatively responsible for the therapeutic effect of those medicinal products via the same mechanism of inhibiting Na+, K+-ATPase. Inhibitory potency on Na+, K+-ATPase by ginsenosides, one of the identified steroid-like compounds, is significantly affected by sugar attachment that might cause steric hindrance of their binding to Na+, K+-ATPase. Ginsenosides with sugar moieties attached only to the C-3 position of the steroid-like structure, equivalent to the sugar position in cardiac glycosides, substantially inhibit Na+, K+-ATPase. However, their inhibitory potency is abolished when sugar moieties are linked to the C-6 or C-20 position of the steroid-like structure. In contrast, no appreciable contents of steroid-like compounds are found in danshen, a well-known Chinese herb traditionally regarded as an effective medicine promoting blood circulation. Instead, magnesium lithospermate B (MLB), the major soluble ingredient in danshen, is assumed to be responsible for the therapeutic effect by inhibiting Na+, K+-ATPase in a manner comparable to cardiac glycosides. Neuroprotective effects of cardiac glycosides, ginsenosides and MLB against ischemic stroke were accordingly observed in a cortical brain slice-based assay model. Whether the neuroprotection is also triggered by inhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase remains to be investigated. Molecular modeling suggests that cardiac glycosides, ginsenosides and MLB presumably bind to the same extracellular pocket of the Na+, K+-ATPase alpha subunit.

20353105|t|[Comprehensive therapeutic protocol of electroacupuncture combined with Chinese herbs and rehabilitation training for treatment of cerebral infarction: a multi-center randomized controlled trial].
20353105|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic effect of comprehensive therapeutic protocol of electroacupuncture combined with active-blood-and-dissolve-stasis herbs and rehabilitation training for cerebral infarction. METHODS: A multi-center randomized controlled trial was done, three hundred and twenty cases were divided into four groups: electroacupuncture combined with active-blood and dissolve-stasis herbs and rehabilitation training group (group A), electroacupuncture combined with rehabilitation training group (group B), herbs combined with rehabilitation training group (group C) and rehabilitation training group (group D), 80 cases in each group. The following two groups of acupoints were used alternatively in electroacupuncture treatment: the first group including Vasomotor Area, Jianyu (LI 15), Biguan (ST 31), Hegu (LI 4) and Taichong (LR 3); the second group including Motor Area, Quchi (LI 11), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and Shenshu (BL 23). 20 mL Xiangdan injection and 250 mL 5% glucose injection or 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride injection were used by intravenous drip in herbs treatment once a day. The rehabilitation training was performed by the professional physical therapist. Each group was treated with corresponding treatment protocol. The therapeutic effect was evaluated by index of the mortality or disability rate 3 months after the onset of disease. The intention to treat analysis (ITT) was used in data. RESULTS: The mortality or handicap rate 3 months after the onset of disease of four groups were 17.5% (14/80) in group A, 22.5% (18/80) in group B, 40. 0% (32/80) in group C, and 31.3% (25/80) in group D, respectively. The group A has a best therapeutic effect (vs group C, group D, both P<0.05), and there was no adverse event. CONCLUSION: The combined application of electroacupuncture, active-blood and dissolve-stasis herbs and rehabilitation training is a better treatment for cerebral infarction in clinic.

19946239|t|Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis manifested by transient ischemic attack.
19946239|a|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) is a very infrequent disorder that causes a localized or diffuse thickening of the dura mater. The main clinical features of IHCP at presentation are headache, cranial nerve involvement, ataxia, and seizures. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) have not previously been reported as a main clinical manifestation. We present a case with TIA as the main clinical manifestation and investigated the treatment of the case. CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old male complaining of recurrent left hemiparesis for 22 days was admitted into our hospital. The clinical characteristics and CT, MRI, and pathological data were investigated carefully. IHCP was diagnosed and pulse corticosteroid therapy was used to treat this case. Headache, neck pain and recurrent episodes of weakness and numbness in the left limbs were the main clinical manifestations. CT and MRI revealed thickening of the dura along the falx and tentorium. Meningeal biopsy showed diffused thickening of the dura, consisting of collagen in concentric form with inflammatory cell infiltrating and fibrinoid necrosis, confirmed to be dura mater by histopathological examination. Treatment with an antiplatelet drug, low molecular heparin and herbs did not prevent the attacks. Pulse corticosteroid therapy was used and good efficiency was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent episodes of TIAs can be the main clinical manifestations of IHCP, and pulse corticosteroid therapy was effective.

19772117|t|Medication safety series: take charge!
19772117|a|Nurses have read the statistics on the numbers of prescription medications seniors take each day and the pitfalls and diverse problems that occur as a result. Various scenarios contribute to this problem: multiple healthcare providers prescribe medications; the use of over-the-counter products and herbs or alcohol cause medication interactions; and patients increase, decrease, skip, or repeat doses. When medications are not taken correctly, an increase in the number of physician or emergency department visits and hospitalizations results. Patients who come to a rehabilitation unit after joint replacement or hip-pinning surgery, stroke, or for treatment of other conditions may be prescribed medications that differ from the drugs they were taking at home. These patients and their families need to learn how to safely take their new medications. This presentation describes how five nurses developed a medication safety program consisting of four segments: Making Your Medication List; Talking to Your Healthcare Team About Your Medications; Safely Storing, Taking, and Destroying Your Medications; and Knowing the Difference Between Allergies, Side Effects, and Interactions. This article also describes the development of the script and PowerPoint program, lessons learned from the first presentation, and implications for rehabilitation nurses. The information presented in this series can help patients and families take charge of their medications. The team of community educators who wrote this article encourages the integration of this program into readers' local patient communities because standards of care and resources vary in the communities that nurses serve.

19457765|t|Berberine reduces the hypoxic-ischemic insult in rat pup brain.
19457765|a|Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from medicinal herbs, has been used as antipyretic, antidiarrheal, bactericide and anti-inflammatory agent. In this study, berberine effects on neuronal damage have been examined. The right carotid artery of seven-day-old rat pups was ligated (ischemic insult), then berberine solution (0.2, 0.5, 1 or 2 mg/kg) was injected intra-peritoneally, and 30 minutes later pups were passed through hypoxic condition with breathing in air containing 10% oxygen and 90% nitrogen(hypoxic insult). The day after that the brains of pups were enucleated for pathologic assessment. Pathologic review of the samples obtained from rats treated with different doses of berberine in comparison with samples from pups treated by normal saline showed that there was a significant reduction of brain injury and edema in the rats treated with berberine. Our study also demonstrates that berberine reduces brain ischemic-hypoxic injury dose-dependently. Therefore, beberine may be considered as useful anti-stroke agent.

18204101|t|Safety and efficacy of blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides) during pregnancy and lactation.
18204101|a|BACKGROUND: There is a lack of basic knowledge on the part of both clinicians and patients as to the indications for use and safety of herbal medicines in pregnancy and lactation. This is one article in a series that systematically reviews the evidence for commonly used herbs during pregnancy and lactation. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the literature for evidence on the use, safety and pharmacology of blue cohosh, focusing on issues pertaining to pregnancy and lactation. METHODS: We searched 7 electronic databases and compiled data according to the grade of evidence found. RESULTS: According to a survey of midwives in the United States, approximately 64% of midwives reported using blue cohosh as a labour-inducing aid. There are three case reports in the scientific literature that blue cohosh taken at the time of delivery may cause; 1) perinatal stroke, 2) acute myocardial infarction, profound congestive heart failure and shock and 3) severe multi-organ hypoxic injury. There is one case report that blue cohosh possesses abortifacient properties. There is in vitro evidence that blue cohosh may have teratogenic, embryotoxic and oxytoxic effects. In lactation, the safety of blue cohosh is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available scientific information, blue cohosh should; 1) be used with extreme caution during pregnancy, 2) be used only under medical professional supervision and 3) not be available to the public as an over-the-counter product. There is an urgent need to conduct a retrospective or prospective cohort study of midwifes using blue cohosh in order to determine its safety. Key words: Blue cohosh, caulophyllum thalictroides, pregnancy, lactation, breastfeeding, systematic review.

17845922|t|Acute dural sinus thrombosis following ingestion of an herbal tonic: case report.
17845922|a|OBJECTIVE: The use of herbals and health supplements is not without risk. This case report of a 17-year-old girl who presented with acute dural sinus thrombosis following herbal tonic ingestion illustrates the dangers of unsupervised ingestion of "health supplements." SUBJECT AND METHODS: A 17-year-old girl with normal menses and no prior medical history, procoagulant risk factors, or oral contraceptives use, presented following ingestion of herbal liquid for 2 days, with signs and symptoms of dural sinus thrombosis confirmed by CT scan. MRI and MRV showed bilateral transverse sinuses thrombosis. The patient had an extensive workup, and all procoagulant disorders or factors, including Behcet's disease, were ruled out. The temporal profile of the ingestion of herbal fluid may suggest association with the development of sinus thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Combinations of herbs in dietary or health supplements could potentiate their subclinical procoagulant effects, and this case highlights the need to report such serious central nervous system adverse effects associated with the ingestion of herbal preparations.

17908423|t|An examination of the bleeding complications associated with herbal supplements, antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications.
17908423|a|Dental professionals routinely treat patients taking prescription, nonprescription, and herbal medications that are known or have the potential to alter bleeding. Prescription anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications, as well as over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin, are typically taken to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke. Herbal supplements are widely used for a variety of indications, and both patients and health care practitioners are often unaware of the anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects that occur as either predictable pharmacologic effects or adverse side effects of herbal medicines. In addition, patient use of these herbal supplements is usually undisclosed to health care providers. The purpose of this literature review is to examine the mechanisms of action of drugs and herbs that alter bleeding, and to educate dental professionals as to the proper care and management of patients using these medications. Decision-making strategies, including interpretation of laboratory tests, and when to discontinue the use of these medications are discussed. Patients undergoing routine dental and dental hygiene procedures do not need to discontinue the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications. However, alterations in drug use may be required for those patients undergoing invasive surgical procedures. It is recommended that herbal supplements must be discontinued 2 weeks prior to receiving invasive surgical procedures. Dental practitioners must learn to weigh the risks of discontinuing drug therapy against the potential risks to patients, and implement risk reduction strategies to minimize adverse bleeding complications associated with dental treatment.

17698456|t|Adjunctive care with nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic complementary and alternative medicine modalities in stroke treatment and rehabilitation.
17698456|a|This article presents an overview of nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic treatment options from complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as adjuncts in stroke prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. Despite many promising leads, the evidence does not favor recommendation of most of these treatments from a public health policy perspective. However, simple preventive interventions such as use of a high-quality multivitamin/multimineral supplement in patients with undernutrition may improve outcomes with minimal long-term risk. Natural agents such as the antioxidant alphalipoic acid, certain traditional Asian herbal mixtures, and some homeopathically prepared remedies show promise for reducing infarct size and associated impairments. A number of nutrients and herbs may assist in treatment of stroke-related complications such as pressure sores, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia. Individualized homeopathy may even play a helpful adjunctive role in treatment of sepsis. However, a great deal of systematic research effort lies ahead before most of the options discussed would meet mainstream medical standards for introduction into routine treatment regimens.

17541150|t|Anti-inflammatory effect of oyaksungisan in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from cerebral infarction patients.
17541150|a|Oyaksungisan, the herbal prescription composed of eleven herbs, has been widely used in treatment of cerebral infarct in Oriental Medicine. However, the mechanisms by which the herbal formula affects on the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in cerebral infarction patients remain unknown yet. The secretory levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly increased in both LPS and PHA-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cerebral infarction patients. However, pretreatment with oyaksungisan significantly inhibited the secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory in PBMCs. Also, oyaksungisan induced a significant increase of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in PBMCs. Thus, these data indicate that oyaksungisan may be beneficial in the cessation of inflammatory processes of cerebral infarct through suppression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 and induction of TGF-beta1.

17317368|t|Use of dietary supplements among United States adults with coronary artery disease and atherosclerotic risks.
17317368|a|The study seeks to describe the use of dietary supplements promoted for cardiovascular health and the relation between supplement use and coronary artery disease (CAD) and the presence of major CAD risk factors. The aim is also to explore whether use of medications for the treatment of cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with supplement use. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of 6,671 adults (representing 119.3 million US adults) aged > or =40 years. We categorized adults into 4 nonoverlapping groups as (1) having reported CAD or stroke (CAD/stroke), (2) DM without CAD/stroke, (3) hypertension (HTN) or hypercholesterolemia (HC) without CAD/stroke or DM (HTN/HC), or (4) none of these conditions (no reported CAD/CAD risk) and performed weighted (NHANES) multiple logistic regression to determine the odds of using supplements (reference group, no reported CAD/CAD risk). After controlling for sociodemographics, health, and lifestyle factors, we found that persons with CAD/Stroke used more supplements (any), vitamin E, folic acid, and niacin, and less fish oil. Those with DM used less coenzyme Q10, and adults with HTN/HC used more supplements (any), herbs (any), and ginseng. Adults with CAD/stroke who used medications for the treatment of cardiovascular disease or DM were more likely to use folic acid compared with those who did not use medications for these conditions. In adults with CAD/stroke, DM, or HTN/HC, those who did not use medications for these conditions were more likely to use herbs and other select supplements. In conclusion, use of dietary supplements is common in those with CAD or CAD risks.

17268076|t|Neuroprotective effect of palmul-chongmyeong-tang on ischemia-induced learning and memory deficits in the rat.
17268076|a|Ginseng Radix, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Poria, Glycyrrhizae Radix, Angelicae Gigantis Radix, Ligusticum Rhizoma, Rehmanniae Radix, Paeoniae Radix, Acori Graminei Rhizoma, and Polygalae Radix have been widely used as herbal medicine against ischemia. In order to test the neuroprotective effect of a novel prescription, the present study examined the effects of Palmul-Chongmyeong-Tang (PMCMT) consisting of these ten herbs on learning and memory in the Morris water maze task and the central cholinergic system of rats with cerebral ischemia-induced neuronal and cognitive impairments. After middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h, rats were administered with saline or PMCMT (200 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for 2 weeks, followed by their training to the tasks. In the water maze test, the animals were trained to find a platform in a fixed position during 6 d and then received a 60 s probe trial on the 7th day following removal of the platform from the pool. Rats with ischemic insults showed impaired learning and memory of the tasks and treatment with PMCMT produced a significant improvement in escape latency to find the platform in the Morris water maze. Consistent with behavioral data, treatment with PMCMT also reduced the loss of cholinergic immunoreactivity in the hippocampus induced by cerebral ischemia. These results demonstrated that PMCMT has a protective effect against ischemia-induced neuronal and cognitive impairments. The present study suggested that PMCMT might be useful in the treatment of vascular dementia.

17359635|t|Protective effects of a novel herbal decoction on focal cerebral ischemia in a rodent model.
17359635|a|BACKGROUND: Herbs have been used to treat stroke and coma patient in traditional Korean medicine (TKM). The novel decoction, Guhpoongchungsimhwan (GCH), was developed on the basis of clinical data and TKM theory. METHODS: We examined the neuroprotective effect of GCH on cerebral ischemia. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used to produce cerebral ischemia in Sprague-Dawley rats. Subjects were treated with GCH (50 or 200 mg/kg) or vehicle alone (controls) 0 and 2 hours after MCAO. The functional status was tested 24 hours after MCAO by neurological examination (clinical score) and by series of motor function tasks (foot placement and parallel bar crossing). RESULTS: The infarct volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining 24 hours after surgery, and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 was determined by immunohistochemistry. The clinical score of the GCH-treated group (200 mg/kg) was significantly lower than that of the control group (p<0.05), indicating fewer neurological deficits. The impairment of motor functions induced by MCAO was significantly reduced by the administration of GCH (p<0.05). The infarct volume was significantly smaller in the GCH-treated group (203.1 +/- 40.2 mm(3), p<0.05), as compared to the control group (377.8 +/- 32.6 mm(3)). The level of motor function in the GCH-treated group was associated with reduced infarct volume. In the analysis of immunohistochemistry, GCH treatment markedly inhibited the ischemia-induced expression of PTGS2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxidase synthase 2) or cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), which plays an important role in ischemic neuronal cell death. CONCLUSION: The results showed that GCH reduced the infarct size and the functional deficits in MCAO rats.

16923460|t|Use of complementary therapies in patients with cardiovascular disease.
16923460|a|Previous studies have suggested that patients with chronic medical conditions use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) at a higher rate than the general population. Despite recent interest in CAM for cardiovascular disease, few data are available regarding patterns of use in patients with cardiovascular disease in the United States. This study used the 2002 National Health Interview Survey and analyzed data on CAM use in 10,572 respondents with cardiovascular disease. Among those with cardiovascular disease, 36% had used CAM (excluding prayer) in the previous 12 months. The most commonly used therapies were herbal products (18%) and mind-body therapies (17%). Among herbs, echinacea, garlic, ginseng, ginkgo biloba, and glucosamine with or without chondroitin were most commonly used. Among mind-body therapies, deep-breathing exercises and meditation were most commonly used. Overall, CAM was used most frequently for musculoskeletal complaints (24% of respondents who used mind-body therapies, 22% who used herbs, 45% who used any CAM). Mind-body therapies were also used for anxiety or depression (23%) and stress or emotional health and wellness (16%). Herbs were commonly used for head and chest colds (22%). Fewer respondents (10%) used CAM specifically for their cardiovascular conditions (5% for hypertension, 2% for coronary disease, 3% for vascular insufficiency, < 1% for heart failure or stroke). Most, however, who used CAM for their cardiovascular condition perceived the therapies to be helpful (80% for herbs, 94% for mind-body therapies). CAM use was more common in younger respondents, women, Asians, and those with more education and greater incomes. In conclusion, CAM use, particularly herbs and mind-body therapies, is common in the United States in patients with cardiovascular disease and mirrors use in the general population. CAM use specifically to treat cardiovascular conditions, however, is less common.

16458462|t|Paeonol reduced cerebral infarction involving the superoxide anion and microglia activation in ischemia-reperfusion injured rats.
16458462|a|Both Moutan cortex of Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews (MC) and the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall (PL) are important Traditional Chinese herbs used commonly to treat inflammatory and pyretic disorders. Paeonol, a common component of MC causes anti-platelet aggregation and scavenges free radicals. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of Paeonol on cerebral infarct. A total of 60 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were studied. An animal model of cerebral infarct was established by occluding both common carotid arteries and the right middle cerebral artery for 90 min, followed by a 24 h period of reperfusion. The percentage of cerebral infarction area to total brain area in each piece of brain tissue, and neuro-deficit score were measured. Superoxide anion was determined by the number of lucigenin-chemiluminescence (CL) counts. ED1 (mouse anti rat CD68) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) immunostaining in the cerebral infarction region were also investigated for activation of microglia. The results indicated that Paeonol 15 and 20 mg/kg pretreatment and 20 mg posttreatment reduced the cerebral infarction area; Paeonol 15 and 20 mg/kg pretreatment reduced the neuro-deficit score. In addition, Paeonol 20 mg/kg pretreatment reduced the lucigenin-CL counts at 2 h period of reperfusion. The number of ED1 and IL-1beta immunoreactive cells also reduced in the cerebral infarction region; there were no significant changes in blood sugar levels. The results show that Paeonol reduced cerebral infarct and neuro-deficit in rat, suggesting Paeonol might play a similar role in reducing cerebral infarction in humans. Paeonol suppresses and scavenges superoxide anion, and inhibit microglia activation and IL-1beta in ischemia-reperfusion injured rats.

16176761|t|Neuroprotective effect of sodium ferulate on transient focal cerebral ischemia by weakening activation of postsynaptic density-95 in rats.
16176761|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of sodium ferulate (SF), an intravenous drug made from traditional Chinese herbs, on activation of postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and neuroprotection after transient cerebral artery occlusion in rats. METHODS: Forty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 2 groups (n=23 in each group): the control group and the SF group. After anesthesia, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was conducted with the intraluminal filament technique. The neurological deficit was assessed with the method devised by Bederson et al. The 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to assess the infarct volume. We adopted a modified six-point scale to conduct neurobehavioral evaluation. Immediately the activation of postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) was studied with Western blot analysis system in the cortex and striatum of rat brain. RESULTS: The neurologic deficit score of the SF group decreased substantially compared with that of the control group (P<0.05). The infarct volume of the control group (168.1 mm3 +/- 42.2 mm3) was significantly larger than that of the SF group (61.5 mm3 +/- 28.7 mm3) at 24 hours after reperfusion (P<0.01). And the rats showed some neurological deficit. The activity of PSD-95 in the SF group at most timepoints was less than that in the control group. No upregulation of PSD-95 protein could be detected in the contralateral cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Sodium ferulate can induce a neuroprotective effect against the transient focal cerebral ischemic injury and weaken the activation of PSD-95 in ischemic area after MCAO.

16005837|t|Perceptions, knowledge and misuse of an oriental herbal drug: a survey of 608 Korean female nursing college students.
16005837|a|This study was designed to survey college students about their knowledge and use of Uwhangchungsimwon (UC), a Traditional Oriental herbal remedy for emergency and acute treatment of stroke, numbness, hypertension, epilepsy and arteriosclerosis. Students at three female nursing colleges in Korea completed a questionnaire containing 29 questions about the students' demographics, knowledge and use of UC, and the placebo effect. Of 608 respondents, 217 (36%) had taken UC. Eighty-three per cent reported that UC alleviated examination tension and 28% knew that it is used as an emergency drug for stroke. Forty-two per cent believed that UC has a "placebo effect" and 20% considered its effects were more than that of a placebo. Fifty-eight per cent of those using UC felt that it was effective in inducing psychological relaxation, 4% considered that it increased their energy levels, and 6% felt it was effective in "clearing the head"; 33% reported no effects. Users also reported adverse effects: 30% reported drowsiness, 17% reported a "heavy head" and 15% experienced indigestion. Most respondents (73%) obtained information about UC from family members and friends and 33% from newspapers or the media. These results confirm health practitioner should recognize that UC is used widely for purposes other than its intended purpose (i.e., to treat stroke and hypertension) and that such use can cause adverse effects. More systematic research is needed to increase the safety of consumers when using herbs and herbal supplements.

15845212|t|Neuroprotective herbs for stroke therapy in traditional eastern medicine.
15845212|a|Traditional Eastern Medicine (TEM) has a long history in stroke therapy and its therapeutic efficacy has been confirmed by clinical studies. Extensive experience and abundant clinical data on TEM in stroke treatment have been accumulated over the past thousand years. Basic and clinical research in TEM constitutes a potentially rich source for new drug discovery and development with the integration of TEM and Western pharmacology. In recent years, many attempts have been made to document research data from extracts of composite formulas, single herbs, or single compounds from TEM herbs, according to orthodox pharmacological actions. This article reviews herbs and prescriptions that have been documented to have a neuroprotective effect in in vitro and in vivo ischemic model systems, and the neuroprotective compounds isolated from them. I also discuss the neuroprotective mechanisms of prescriptions, herbs, and single compounds relevant to the treatment of brain ischemia, including anti-oxidant, anti-excitotoxic, and anti-inflammatory effects.

15975314|t|Effect of the principle of activating blood circulation to break stasis on GMP-140 and D2 dimer in patients with acute cerebral infarction.
15975314|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical efficacy of the principle of activating blood circulation to break stasis (ABCBS) and its influence on platelet membranous protein particle (GMP-140) and D(2) dimer (D-dimer) before and after treatment. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with blood stasis syndrome (BSS) of acute cerebral infarction (ACI) were randomly divided into two groups, both of which were treated with conventional treatment, i.e. with western medicine (WM), with Salvia injection added through intravenously dripping. One of the two groups was used as the control and the other group as the treated group who had ABCBS herbs orally taken in addition. The duration of treatment course for both groups was 3 weeks. RESULTS: There were changes in both groups over clinical symptoms, nerve function deficit scoring and GMP-140, D-dimer, but the treated group showed significantly better than that of the control group, (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ABCBS principle could serve as an important auxiliary treating method for BSS of ACI, as it can effectively alter the blood of ACI patients which was viscous, condense, coagulant and aggregating.

15706927|t|[The influence of CGE on expression of IL-1beta and c-fos protein in the hippocampus region in rats following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion].
15706927|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe inhibiting effect of CGE (compound ginseng extract) on increased expression of IL-1beta and c-fos protein following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. METHOD: The vascular dementia model was made by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 hours. Expression of IL-1beta and c-fos were determined by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus regions in brain tissue at the 0.5 h-7 d after reperfusion. CGE was diluted by CMC and poured into the stomach by 0.7 mL x (100 g)(-1) with a high dosage (19.34 x 10(3) g x L(-1) row herbs), a middle dosage (9.67 x 10(3) g x L(-1)), a low dosage (4.83 x 10(3) g x L(-1)). There were an IL-1ra (rhIL-1ra 20 microg injected into the left cerebral ventricle), a sham operation (NaCl 20 microL injected into the left cerebral ventricle) and a model as control. RESULT: Compared with control group, three dose groups (low, middle and high) in CGE showed significant inhibiting effects on the expression of c-fos protein at 2, 3, 4, 12 hours and 3 day following cerebral ischaemic-reperfusion. The level of the inhibiting effects in small and middle groups were lower at all time points than that in IL-1ra group (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). CGE inhibited the expression of hippocampus IL-1beta protein, taking effect from the 2 h after reperfusion. Both HD group (531 +/- 151.1) and MD group (589.3 +/- 78.6) showed more obvious effect which lasted until the 72 h compared with the model group (687.6 +/- 116.7) (P < 0.01 and 0.05). Large dose group (81.3 +/- 16.1) showed the same level of the inhibiting effect on expression of c-fos protein as IL-1ra group (67.2 +/- 25.7) from 4 hour on following cerebral ischaemic reperfusion (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CGE with function of Yiqi Bushen, Huoxue Huatan has effect of inhibiting up-regulated expression of IL-1beta and c-fos protein following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. However, this effect of CGE starts relatively later than that of IL-1ra. The effect of CGE is associated with its dosage, i.e. a larger dosage has a better effect on expression of c-fos protein in post-stroke dementia.

15185839|t|Flavonoids from Radix Scutellariae as potential stroke therapeutic agents by targeting the second postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95)/disc large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domain of PSD-95.
15185839|a|Excessive activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and subsequent production of nitric oxide by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) contribute to neuronal damage resulting from hypoxic and ischemic insults. NMDARs and nNOS are coupled together at the postsynaptic membrane through their interaction with postsynaptic density protein (PSD) 95 via PSD-95/disc large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domains. We used NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy to screen medicinal herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) stroke therapy for compounds binding to the second PDZ domain (PDZ2) of PSD-95, the domain linking nNOS and PSD-95. Aqueous extract of Huangqin, the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Labiatae), showed significant binding to PDZ2 of PSD-95. The binding site of the active components in the extract overlapped with the nNOS/NR2B-binding pocket of PDZ2 of PSD-95. Four flavones, baicalin, norwogonoside, oroxylin A-glucuronide (oroxyloside), and wogonoside were isolated and found to account for the PDZ-binding activity of the extract. NMR titration experiments showed that baicalin and norwogonoside displayed the highest PDZ2 binding affinity, while oroxylin A-glucuronide and wogonoside showed 4-5 fold less potency in binding to the PDZ domain. Identification of the PDZ binding activity of these compounds will allow investigating whether or not it contributes to the observed clinical effects of Radix Scutellariae. Furthermore, these molecules might provide leads for the development of drugs targeting the signaling pathways mediated by PDZ domains.

14649555|t|Alternative therapy use by Chinese-Canadian children with stroke and cerebrovascular disease.
14649555|a|The use of alternative therapies in immigrant children with stroke and cerebrovascular diseases has not been reported. We identified immigrant and first-generation Chinese-Canadian children with stroke and cerebrovascular diseases in a pediatric stroke clinic and used standardized questionnaires to interview their parents about alternative therapy use. The chi-square test was used to assess the associations of parental educational level and foreign birth in the child with alternative therapy use. We identified 17 children, 9 boys and 8 girls. Six were immigrants to Canada and 11 were Canadian born. Nine of 17 families (53%) reported using alternative therapies. All 9 used Chinese herbs, but only 3 were able to report the names of specific preparations. Four families were using medications that had the potential to affect coagulation. Documentation of alternative therapy use was found in the medical charts of 3 of the 9 patients. Three families reported feeling uncomfortable discussing alternative therapy use with their physicians. We did not see an association between alternative therapy use and parental educational level or foreign birth in the child. Physicians should be aware that parents of children with stroke may be using alternative therapies to treat their children and may be unwilling or unable to report all therapies used.

14715446|t|Cell culture protection and in vivo neuroprotective capacity of flavonoids.
14715446|a|Flavonoids are an important group of recognized antioxidants ubiquitous in fruits, vegetables and herbs. There are epidemiological evidences for the stroke-protecting capacity of flavonoids and while the neuroprotective power of complex extracts rich in flavonoids like those of Ginkgo biloba, green tea or lyophilized red wine have been demonstrated in several studies, neuroprotection by individual flavonoids has been poorly studied in vivo. The neuroprotective capacity of individual flavonoids was studied in PC12 cells in culture and in a model of permanent focal ischemia (permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion - pMCAO). In the in vivo experiments, flavonoids were administered in lecithin preparations to facilitate the crossing of the blood brain barrier. The simultaneous incubation of PC12 cells with 200 micro M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and different flavonoids for 30 min resulted in a conspicuous profile: quercetin, fisetin, luteolin and myricetin significantly increased cell survival while catechin, kaempherol and taxifolin did not. Quercetin was detected in brain tissue 30 min and 1 h after intraperitoneal administration. When one of the protective flavonoids (quercetin) and one of those that failed to increase PC12 cell survival (catechin) were assessed for their protective capacity in the pMCAO model, administered i.p. 30 min after vessel occlusion, quercetin significantly decreased the brain ischemic lesion while catechin did not. It is concluded that when administered in liposomal preparations, flavonoids structurally related to quercetin could become leads for the development of a new generation of molecules to be clinically effective in human brain ischemia.

12204769|t|Hwangryun-Hae-Dok-tang (Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang) extract and its constituents reduce ischemia-reperfusion brain injury and neutrophil infiltration in rats.
12204769|a|The preventive effect of Hwangryun-Hae-Dok-tang (HHDT, Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang), a Chinese herbal medicine, and its ingredients on ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury was evaluated in the rat brain. HHDT consists of four herbs, namely, Coptidis rhizoma, Scutellariae radix, Phellodendri cortex, and Gardeniae fructus. Ischemia was induced by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 120 min and reperfusion was continued for 22 h. HHDT (200 mg/kg), Coptidis rhizoma (100 mg/kg), Scutellariae radix (100 mg/kg), Phellodendri cortex (100 mg/kg), and Gardeniae fructus (100 mg/kg) were orally administered, promptly prior to reperfusion and 2 h after reperfusion. Baicalein, a component of Scutellariae radix, was also examined at a dosage of 50 mg/kg given 2 h apart, promptly prior to and 2 h after reperfusion. Total infarction volume in the ipsilateral hemisphere of ischemia/reperfusion rats was significantly lowered by treatment with HHDT, Scutellariae radix, and balicalein. However, the other ingredient of HHDT did not show any ameliorating effects on total infarction volume. The inhibiting effect of Scutellariae radix on total infarction volume was much higher than that of the others. In addition, HHDT, Scutellariae radix, and baicalein significantly inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, an index of neutrophil infiltration in ischemic brain tissue at about the same rate (30%). There was marked mismatch between total infarction volume and MPO activity in the Scutellariae radix-treated rats but not in the HHDT- and baicalein-treated groups. Our findings suggest that Scutellariae radix as an ingredient of HHDT plays a crucial protective role in ischemia-induced brain injury. In addition, it is apparent that the effect of Scutellariae radix is the result, in part, of baicalein, a compound contained in Scutellariae radix.

12905663|t|[A forty-year study on hypertension].
12905663|a|Since 1959 the investigations on prevalence of hypertension and studies on the prevention and treatment of this disease have been carried out. The vascular mechanism of hypertension and the depressor effect of Chinese traditional herbs were also studied in Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The results revealed that: (1) The prevalence of hypertension in Chinese adults increased from 7.73% in 1979 to 11.26% in 1991, both much higher than that in 1959 (5.11%). The rate of awareness, treatment and control was only 26.3%, 12.1%, and 2.8% respectively. The risk factors of hypertension included overweight and alcohol drinking. High sodium, low potassium, low calcium, and low animal protein diet were also very important risk for elevation of blood pressure. Hypertension was the most important causal risk factor of coronary heart disease and stroke. (2) Hypertension diagnosis and staging criteria were established in 1959. Secondary hypertension was found to constitute 1.1% among community hypertensive patients. The new concept of aortitis was formed and found to be the most common cause of renal vascular hypertension. Patient education together with low dose compounds of antihypertensive drugs was implicated widely. Randomized clinical trials Syst-China, Post-stroke Antihypertensive Treatment Study, Chinese Acute Stroke Trial, and Chinese Cardiac Study 1 demonstrated benefits of treatment for hypertensive, stroke or acute myocardial infarction affordable by Chinese population at large. (3) A series of functional changes and abnormalities with evident hereditary characteristics were found in the processes of cellular Ca2+ transportation, utilization, metabolism and their modulation of the vascular smooth muscle in SHR, and SHRsp, which seem to be the principal cause of the increase in peripheral vascular resistance in hypertension. (4) Alkaloid of Rauwolfia verticilata and Ligustrazine had marked depressor effect. Flavones of Radix Pueraricae could reduce the cardiac and cerebral ischemic damage and symptoms in hypertensive patients.

11321431|t|Herbs of activating blood circulation to remove blood stasis.
11321431|a|Drugs with the efficacy of modifying rheological properties of blood, blood vessels and their interactions are denoted by "hemorheologicals". Drugs of anti-hyperviscosemia, anti-coagulants, anti-platelet drugs, anti-thrombotics, vasodilators, endothelial cell protectors and anti-arthrosclerosis should be considered as hemorheologicals due to the actions in keeping blood fluidity and in maintaining normal vascular functions. The studies in hemorheology indicate that a tendency of hyperviscosity, hypercoagulation and being prone to thrombosis is prevalent in the elderly. Hemorheologicals are importance for and aging and life-threatening diseases. Blood stasis syndrome is a common pathological syndrome in the elderly. In traditional Chinese medicine, the treatment for the syndrome is by herbs which activates blood circulation to remove blood stasis. The herbs have the efficacy of improving hemorheological events. Therefore, the herbs are the source for developing hemorheologicals. Ligustrazine isolated from Chuangxiong is an example. It showed significant inhibition on shear induced platelet aggregation and on platelet intracellular calcium demonstrated by laser confocal microscope.

16295077|t|Myocardial disease in Nigerians.
16295077|a|The problem of heart disease of unknown aetiology as it is found in the Nigerian environment is presented. The fact that it is nearly impossible on many occasions to make a conclusive diagnosis on clinical grounds alone of either endomyocardial fibrosis and heart muscle disease is discussed and the need for haemodynamic and angiographic studies to make the differentiation is stressed. The clinical, radiological, electrocardiographic, and haemodynamic features of each of the two varieties of "cardiomyopathy" is presented and the distinguishing features are emphasised. The occasional difficulty in differentiating heart muscle disease from hypertensive heart disease is discussed and the fact that the two differ distinctly on haemodynamic pressure studies is established. Previous published hypotheses regarding the aetiology of these cardiac conditions are discussed, and suggestions are made as to the lines of future research including virological studies and the possible myocardiopathic effect of some of the local traditional herbs.
