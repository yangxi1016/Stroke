31638092|a|Alpinia oxyphylla, a traditional herb, is widely used for its neuroprotective, antioxidant and memory-improving effects. However, the neuroprotective mechanisms of action of its active ingredients are unclear. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of various organic extracts of Alpinia oxyphylla on PC12 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury in vitro. Alpinia oxyphylla was extracted three times with 95% ethanol (representing extracts 1-3). The third 95% ethanol extract was dried and resuspended in water, and then extracted successively with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and n-butanol (representing extracts 4-6). The cell counting kit-8 assay and microscopy were used to evaluate cell viability and observe the morphology of PC12 cells. The protective effect of the three ethanol extracts (at tested concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) against cytotoxicity to PC12 cells increased in a concentration-dependent manner. The ethyl acetate, petroleum ether and n-butanol extracts (each tested at 100, 150 and 200 μg/mL) had neuroprotective effects as well. The optimum effective concentration ranged from 50-200 μg/mL, and the protective effect of the ethyl acetate extract was comparatively robust. These results demonstrate that organic extracts of Alpinia oxyphylla protect PC12 cells against apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide. Our findings should help identify the bioactive neuroprotective components in Alpinia oxyphylla.

31900195|t|Reproducibility of GMP-compliant production of therapeutic stressed peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived secretomes, a novel class of biological medicinal products.
31900195|a|BACKGROUND: The recent concept of secretome-based tissue regeneration has profoundly altered the field of regenerative medicine and offers promising novel therapeutic options. In contrast to medicinal products with a single active substance, cell-derived secretomes comprise pleiotropic bioactive ingredients, representing a major obstacle for reproducible drug product efficacy and warranting patient safety. Good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant production guarantees high batch-to-batch consistency and reproducible efficacy of biological medicinal products, but different batches of cellular secretomes produced under GMP have not been compared yet, and suitable quality control parameters have not been established. To this end, we analyzed diverse biological and functional parameters of different batches produced under GMP of the secretome obtained from γ-irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with proven tissue regenerative properties in infarcted myocardium, stroke, spinal cord injury, and skin wounds. METHODS: We quantified key secretome ingredients, including cytokines, lipids, and extracellular vesicles, and functionally assessed potency in tube formation assay, ex vivo aortic ring sprouting assay, and cell-based protein and reporter gene assays. Furthermore, we determined secretome stability in different batches after 6 months of storage at various ambient temperatures. RESULTS: We observed that inter-batch differences in the bioactive components and secretome properties were small despite considerable differences in protein concentrations and potencies between individual donor secretomes. Stability tests showed that the analytical and functional properties of the secretomes remained stable when lyophilisates were stored at temperatures up to + 5 °C for 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: We are the first to demonstrate the consistent production of cell-derived, yet cell-free secretome as a biological medicinal product. The results from this study provide the basis for selecting appropriate quality control parameters for GMP-compliant production of therapeutic cell secretomes and pave the way for future clinical trials employing secretomes in tissue regenerative medicine.

31875457|t|Searching for active ingredients in rehabilitation: applying the taxonomy of behaviour change techniques to a conversation therapy for aphasia.
31875457|a|Purpose: A taxonomy of behaviour change techniques has been developed to help specify the active ingredients of behaviour change interventions. Its potential for rehabilitation research is significant, however, reliable use among allied health professionals has not yet been explored. This article describes the content of a conversation therapy for post-stroke aphasia using the taxonomy and investigates inter-rater reliability among Speech and Language Therapists.Methods and materials: Two Speech and Language Therapists undertook the same half day, self-led training programme in the behaviour change technique taxonomy and independently coded all materials in the "Better Conversations with Aphasia" programme. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated using the kappa coefficient and percentage agreement. Reliably agreed techniques were categorised according to the speaker and type of behaviour they targeted.Results: Sixteen behaviour change techniques were reliably agreed to be present. Inter-rater reliability was moderate (K = 0.465), and in line with satisfactory percentage agreement (79.8%). More techniques were used to target the adoption of new behaviours (15) than the termination of old ones (3). People with aphasia received fewer behaviour change techniques (10) than their communication partners (16).Conclusions: Describing the content of conversation therapy with the taxonomy of behaviour change techniques offers clinically useful insights with potential to enhance both research and practice. The intervention is shown to target different types of behaviour in different ways, and offer different speaker groups different content. Non-psychologist users of the taxonomy may encounter challenges working with unfamiliar concepts and terminology, which may impact on reliable use.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONIn order to change communicative behaviours within conversation, feedback should focus not only on performance but also on the immediate social and emotional consequences of a behaviour.This study adds to the evidence that unhelpful conversational behaviours can be reduced by providing speakers with information about any unwanted consequences, and then agreeing on a supportive behaviour to use instead.People with aphasia should be offered the same range of behaviour change techniques as their communication partners.

31920570|t|Principles of Neurorehabilitation After Stroke Based on Motor Learning and Brain Plasticity Mechanisms.
31920570|a|What are the principles underlying effective neurorehabilitation? The aim of neurorehabilitation is to exploit interventions based on human and animal studies about learning and adaptation, as well as to show that the activation of experience-dependent neuronal plasticity augments functional recovery after stroke. Instead of teaching compensatory strategies that do not reduce impairment but allow the patient to return home as soon as possible, functional recovery might be more sustainable as it ensures a long-term reduction in impairment and an improvement in quality of life. At the same time, neurorehabilitation permits the scientific community to collect valuable data, which allows inferring about the principles of brain organization. Hence neuroscience sheds light on the mechanisms of learning new functions or relearning lost ones. However, current rehabilitation methods lack the exact operationalization of evidence gained from skill learning literature, leading to an urgent need to bridge motor learning theory and present clinical work in order to identify a set of ingredients and practical applications that could guide future interventions. This work aims to unify the neuroscientific literature relevant to the recovery process and rehabilitation practice in order to provide a synthesis of the principles that constitute an effective neurorehabilitation approach. Previous attempts to achieve this goal either focused on a subset of principles or did not link clinical application to the principles of motor learning and recovery. We identified 15 principles of motor learning based on existing literature: massed practice, spaced practice, dosage, task-specific practice, goal-oriented practice, variable practice, increasing difficulty, multisensory stimulation, rhythmic cueing, explicit feedback/knowledge of results, implicit feedback/knowledge of performance, modulate effector selection, action observation/embodied practice, motor imagery, and social interaction. We comment on trials that successfully implemented these principles and report evidence from experiments with healthy individuals as well as clinical work.

31720730|t|Systematic quality evaluation of Peiyuan Tongnao capsule by offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography/quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry and adjusted parallel reaction monitoring of quality markers.
31720730|a|Peiyuan Tongnao capsule (PTC) is a prescription medicine of traditional Chinese medicine with the effects of "nourishing the kidney," "replenishing essence," "extinguishing wind," and "opening the meridian". PTC is also widely used in clinic for the treatment of stroke and chronic cerebral circulation insufficiency. However, the quality control studies of PTC are hitherto quite limited. Here, we aim to fully utilize an advanced chromatography-mass spectrometry hyphenation technique to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the quality of PTC. Firstly, a two-dimensional liquid chromatography/quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (2D-LC/Q-Orbitrap-MS) approach was established for multicomponent characterization. An offline 2D-LC system fitted with an Xbridge Amide column and an HSS T3 column showed an orthogonality of 0.63 and a theoretical peak capacity of 6930. Eleven fractions of PTC, after hydrophilic interaction chromatography (first dimension), were further analyzed by reversed-phase ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/Q-Orbitrap-MS (UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap-MS, second dimension) using a rapid negative/positive switching mode. Consequently, 178 compounds were separated, 96 of which were identified or tentatively characterized. Secondly, co-condition fingerprint analysis of seven constituted herbal medicines of PTC was performed to unveil ten active ingredients (citric acid, rehmannioside D, echinacoside, paeoniflorin, verbascoside, liquiritin, 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside, cinnamic aldehyde, glycyrrhizic acid, and emodin) as the quality markers of PTC. Thirdly, a UHPLC/PRMad (adjusted parallel reaction monitoring) method was established and validated to quantify the ten marker compounds in 14 batches of PTC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report comprehensive multicomponent characterization, authentication, and quality evaluation of PTC, which could be used to lay the foundation for quality control, biological efficacy research, and further development.

31681154|t|A Paradigm Shift: Rehabilitation Robotics, Cognitive Skills Training, and Function After Stroke.
31681154|a|Introduction: Robot-assisted therapy for upper extremity (UE) impairments post-stroke has yielded modest gains in motor capacity and little evidence of improved UE performance during activities of daily living. A paradigm shift that embodies principles of motor learning and exercise dependent neuroplasticity may improve robot therapy outcomes by incorporating active problem solving, salience of trained tasks, and strategies to facilitate the transfer of acquired motor skills to use of the paretic arm and hand during everyday activities. Objective: To pilot and test the feasibility of a novel therapy protocol, the Active Learning Program for Stroke (ALPS), designed to complement repetitive, robot-assisted therapy for the paretic UE. Key ALPS ingredients included training in the use of cognitive strategies (e.g., STOP, THINK, DO, CHECK) and a goal-directed home action plan (HAP) to facilitate UE self-management and skill transfer. Methods: Ten participants with moderate impairments in UE function >6 months after stroke received eighteen 1-h treatment sessions 2-3/x week over 6-8 weeks. In addition to ALPS training, individuals were randomly assigned to either robot-assisted therapy (RT) or robot therapy and task-oriented training (RT-TOT) to trial whether the inclusion of TOT reinforced participants' understanding and implementation of ALPS strategies. Results: Statistically significant group differences were found for the upper limb subtest of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE) at discharge and one-month follow-up favoring the RT group. Analyses to examine overall effects of the ALPS protocol in addition to RT and RT-TOT showed significant and moderate to large effects on the FMA-UE, Motor Activity Log, Wolf Motor Function Test, and hand portion of the Stroke Impact Scale. Conclusion: The ALPS protocol was the first to extend cognitive strategy training to robot-assisted therapy. The intervention in this development of concept pilot trial was feasible and well-tolerated, with good potential to optimize paretic UE performance following robot-assisted therapy.

31610480|t|The profiling and identification of the absorbed constituents and metabolites of Naoshuantong capsule in mice biofluids and brain by ultra- fast liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry.
31610480|a|Naoshuantong capsule (NSTC) is an oral traditional Chinese medicine formula used widely in the clinic for ischemic stroke. The absorbed ingredients and metabolites of NSTC have never been reported before. In this study, a method incorporating rapid resolution liquid chromatography with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to identify absorbed ingredients and metabolites after oral administration of NSTC. A total of 15 constituents were detected and identified as prototypes of NSTC. 109 metabolites related to catechin, gallic acid, paeoniflorin, chlorogenic acid, protocatechuate, typhaneoside, β-elemene, calycosin were identified in serum, urine and brain. 19 metabolites of typhaneoside, 3 metabolites of β-elemene, 12 metabolites of calycosin were reported for the first time. This is the first time to explore the absorption and metabolism of NSTC. The work will provide helpful information for further research of the mechanism and application of NSTC.

31255722|t|Network pharmacology study of traditional Chinese medicines for stroke treatment and effective constituents screening.
31255722|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Stroke is one of the most frequent causes of death and disability. So far there are no effective preventives or treatments. The therapeutic system of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) has been in use for several thousand years and still affords a valuable resource for today's clinicians in preserving health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We had collected the Chinese medicinal formulae and then commonly used single herbs or drug combinations were analyzed through data mining. The ingredients from the top 30 frequently used herbs which have good druggability and blood-brain barrier permeability were collected as a natural product library. Targets of the related ingredients were predicted using various databases and analyzed by GO and KEGG pathway mapping. The potential stroke targets were validated in the market or from clinical trials, and used to establish molecular docking, HipHop and SBP models to screen new compounds for multi-target activity. Lastly, in vitro experiments with models for oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGDR) were conducted to test the activities of compounds identified by screening. RESULTS: A total of 1679 Chinese medicinal formulas were selected and their prescription rules were analyzed. 4277 compounds were from the top 30 herbs and 3560 molecules were filtered to build the natural product library. The ingredient-target network, target-disease network and target-target interaction network were established to explain the characteristics and mechanisms of the TCMs. Thirty-one molecules were selected to have multi-target activity on targets of stroke via virtual screening. Five of these had already been reported to have therapeutic effects on stroke. Three of the eight compounds which have been examined showed protective effects on OGDR model. CONCLUSIONS: This paper details a novel strategy for exploring the characteristics and mechanisms of herbal medicines from a systematic standpoint in an attempt to identify those affecting specific target pathways related to stroke. Using this methodology on our natural products library, we found a number of lead candidates with multi-target activity.

31782008|t|Essential Role of Chinese Medicines in Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation for Treatment of Ischemic Stroke.
31782008|a|Ischemic stroke accounts for the majority of all strokes and has been primary causes of long-term disability and mortality in worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy suggests significantly improved effects on neurological functional outcome, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, blood-brain barrier permeability, inflammatory injury, neuroprotection and so on, following stroke. However, the occurrence of adverse effects results in restriction of the therapy. Chinese medicine accumulates abundant clinical experiences on stroke for over two thousand years, and some formulae and active ingredients of Chinese medicines have presented obvious efficacies in clinical treatment. Therefore, based on Chinese medicine theory, we provide some ideas of screening agents for combination treatment of Chinese medicines and MSC for ischemic stroke, and summarize the potentials of Chinese medicines in MSC treatment and analyze the feasibilities of Chinese medicines against side effects of MSC therapy. Consequently, we propose Chinese medicines combing with MSC should be a promising approach to clinical stroke treatment in future.

31662991|t|Cell Chromatography-Based Screening of the Active Components in Buyang Huanwu Decoction Promoting Axonal Regeneration.
31662991|a|Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD), a popular formulation prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of ischemic stroke, has been reported to have a potential role in promoting axonal regeneration. The purpose of the study was to screen and identify bioactive compounds from BHD using live PC12 cells coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Using this approach, we successfully identified six bioactive components from BHD. These components have protective effects on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury to PC12 cells. Furthermore, calycosin-7-d-glucoside (CG) and formononetin-7-O-β-d-glucoside (FG) could upregulate the protein expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This study suggests that living cells combined with HPLC-MS/MS can be used for the screening of active ingredients in TCMs.

31348992|t|Computational systems pharmacology reveals an antiplatelet and neuroprotective mechanism of Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection in the treatment of ischemic stroke.
31348992|a|Herbs are typically prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat complex diseases. The multicomponent nature of herbal drug ingredients makes it difficult to readily understand their mode of action. To decipher their molecular mechanisms, here we proposed a novel computational systems pharmacology based approach, which consisted of transcriptome profiling, data collection, statistical analysis, network algorithm, bioinformatics analysis and pharmacological validation. The network algorithm called signed random walk with restart (SRWR) was used to simulate the propagation of drugs' effects on networks. This algorithm could identify proteins either positively or negatively regulated (activated or inhibited) by drugs on human signaling networks. To establish proof of principle, the herbal product Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection (DZXXI), which exhibits pharmacological effects in ischemic stroke but its mechanism was unclear, was analyzed. Eighty-three targets were predicted with high confidence for DZXXI's active compounds in plasma, and 87 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in MCF7 cells treated with DZXXI. These target genes were further found to be associated with pathways involved in neuronal apoptosis in ischemic stroke, such as NF-κB signaling, TNF signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling. Intersection analysis between DZXXI's putative targets with ischemic stroke-associated genes identified two important targets (PTGS1, PTGS2) corresponding to four DZXXI compounds, which were further validated using in silico and in vitro/vivo models. The most inhibited genes identified by the SRWR algorithm were significantly enriched with ischemic stroke-associated disease genes, antiplatelet associated pathways, and their encoded proteins were enriched in brain, vascular endothelium and platelets. The CMAP analysis based on DEGs suggested that DZXXI could function as both an anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet agent. Taken together, the computational analysis suggested that DZXXI exhibited anti-platelet and neuroprotective effects in the treatment of ischemic stroke. These deductions were preliminarily confirmed by subsequent in vitro/vivo studies. This approach provides a systems perspective to study the relevance between herbal drugs and disease processes, and can reveal possible pharmacological effects of multiple ingredients within herbal product.

31269467|t|Rapid identification and analysis of the active components of traditional Chinese medicine Xiaoxuming decoction for ischemic stroke treatment by integrating UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and RRLC-QTRAP MSn method.
31269467|a|Xiaoxuming decoction (XXMD) is a key Chinese medicine prescription, which has been clinically used for stroke treatment for thousands of years in ancient China. The extracted active fraction of XXMD (AF-XXMD) contains almost pharmacological active components with anti-cerebral ischemic effects. However, the illumination of its complex ingredients remains challenging. In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) and rapid resolution liquid chromatography-triple quad linear ion trap mass spectrometry (RRLC-QTRAP MSn) methods were developed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of AF-XXMD, respectively. Data showed that 48 compounds were identified in AF-XXMD by using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, including 14 alkaloids, 14 flavonoids, 12 triterpenoids, 3 chromones, 3 monoterpenes, 1 cyanide glycoside, and 1 volatile oil. Among them, 38 components were unambiguously characterized by their reference standards. A total of 15 compounds in AF-XXMD were first reported. Additionally, 33 compounds were quantified by using RRLC-QTRAP MSn in AF-XXMD. This developed RRLC-QTRAP MSn method provides an adequate linearity (r2 > 0.99) and intrabatch and interbatch variations (RSD < 15%), with recovery (60.3%-107.5%) of 33 compounds concerned. The total content of 33 compounds in AF-XXMD reached 31.53%. The high total contents of compounds of Xing Ren, Shao Yao, and Huang Qin in AF-XXMD were 9.52%, 8.85%, and 7.62%, respectively. The data further showed that cyanophoric glycosides, monoterpenes, and flavonoids were the three most abundant components in AF-XXMD.

31333457|t|Ginkgo Flavonol Glycosides or Ginkgolides Tend to Differentially Protect Myocardial or Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via Regulation of TWEAK-Fn14 Signaling in Heart and Brain.
31333457|a|Shuxuening injection (SXNI), one of the pharmaceutical preparations of Ginkgo biloba extract, has significant effects on both ischemic stroke and heart diseases from bench to bedside. Its major active ingredients are ginkgo ﬂavonol glycosides (GFGs) and ginkgolides (GGs). We have previously reported that SXNI as a whole protected ischemic brain and heart, but the active ingredients and their contribution to the therapeutic effects remain unclear. Therefore, we combined experimental and network analysis approach to further explore the specific effects and underlying mechanisms of GFGs and GGs of SXNI on ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse brain and heart. In the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) model, pretreatment with GFGs at 2.5 ml/kg was superior to the same dose of GGs in improving cardiac function and coronary blood flow and reducing the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase in serum, with an effect similar to that achieved by SXNI. In contrast, pretreatment with GGs at 2.5 ml/kg reduced cerebral infarction area and cerebral edema similarly to that of SXNI but more significantly compared with GFGs in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) model. Network pharmacology analysis of GFGs and GGs revealed that tumor necrosis factor-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)-fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) signaling pathway as an important common mechanism but with differential targets in MIRI and CIRI. In addition, immunohistochemistry and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were performed to evaluate the regulatory roles of GFGs and GGs on the common TWEAK-Fn14 signaling pathway to protect the heart and brain. Experimental results confirmed that TWEAK ligand and Fn14 receptor were downregulated by GFGs to mitigate MIRI in the heart while upregulated by GGs to improve CIRI in the brain. In conclusion, our study showed that GFGs and GGs of SXNI tend to differentially protect brain and heart from ischemia-reperfusion injuries at least in part by regulating a common TWEAK-Fn14 signaling pathway.

31223328|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Anthraquinones from Rhubarb in Central Nervous System Diseases.
31223328|a|Rhubarb is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine; it has been used in China for thousands of years. Rhubarb anthraquinones are the major medicinal ingredients derived from rhubarb including emodin, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol, rhein, physcion, and danthron. These different anthraquinone derivatives alone or in combination play a therapeutic role in central nervous system diseases (CNSD), such as cerebral ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and others. We review the experimental studies on these six anthraquinones in the treatment of CNSD by consulting literature published in the last 20 years in PubMed and then give a future perspective on it. In the end of this paper some deficiencies related to these studies also have been pointed out.

31031621|t|1H NMR-Based Metabolomics Reveals Refined-Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (BBG) as a Potential Ischemic Stroke Treatment Drug With Efficacy and a Favorable Therapeutic Window.
31031621|a|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to treat ischemic stroke. However, the complexity of its chemical composition makes quality control difficult. Berberine, baicalin, and geniposide are the three main ingredients in HLJDD. Here, a formula of BBG comprised of berberine, baicalin, and geniposide, known as Refined-Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction, was investigated for its efficacy, therapeutic window, and mechanisms of action. BBG was assessed on two major types of ischemic stroke, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and continuous ischemia injury, respectively. BBG showed efficacy comparable to HLJDD in the treatment of cerebral I/R injury within 5 h after injury initiation but did poorly in treating continuous ischemia injury. BBG exhibited neuroprotective effects on cerebral I/R injury by regaining the balance in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism, inflammation, and nucleic acid metabolism. These results suggested that BBG could be a good alternative to HLJDD, with high efficacy and a long therapeutic window, which shows great potential for drug development to treat stroke.

31090302|t|[Lipid regulation mechanism and dosage form selection of Xixian Tongshuan Preparation based on molecular simulation methods].
31090302|a|Atherosclerosis is the main cause of stroke, and dyslipidemia is the most important risk factor for atherosclerosis. In this paper, pharmacophore and molecular docking models of eight key lipid-lowering targets, namely NPC1 L1, HMG-CoA reductase, SQS, MTP, CETP, PPARα, LXRα and LXRβ, were used to screen out the small molecular database of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), which was made up of ingredients of thirteen Chinese herbal medicines contained in Xixian Tongshuan Preparation. The screening results indicated that the preparation could showed an effect in regulating lipid on target NPC1 L1, HMG-CoA reductase, LXRβ and SQS through four groups of potential active compounds, namely prupersin A in peach kernel and suffruticoside A in gastrodiaelata, limocitrin-β-D-glucoside in Ligusticum chuanxiong, 2'-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-sweroside in Pinellia ternate and quercitrin in Panax notoginseng, 4-tert-butyl-2-[(5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-phenyl)methoxy-methyl]-6-(hydroxymethyl)p henol in Gastrodia elata. Moreover, the properties and extraction process of the most potentialactive compounds were consistent with the preparation process of Xixian Tongshuan Capsules, which indicated that the capsule had more advantages than the pill in the existing two dosage forms of Xixian Tongshuan Preparation. This study analyzed the pharmacodynamic basis and mechanism of Xixian Tongshuan Capsules in regulating lipid for treating stroke, and provided evidence for its further research and clinical application.

30834085|t|Methanolic leaf extract of Punica granatum attenuates ischemia-reperfusion brain injury in Wistar rats: Potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
30834085|a|Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate the cerebroprotective effect of methanolic leaf extract of Punica granatum (MePG) in Wistar rats. Materials and Methods: The MePG was initially assessed for in vitro antioxidant activity, and later evaluated on LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell line assay. Finally, the MePG was evaluated against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced brain injury in Wistar rats. Results: In DPPH, FRAP and ORAC assays, the MePG has exhibited potent antioxidant activity. Further, the MePG has significantly inhibited the generation of nitrite, ROS and TNF-α in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell lines. Besides, global ischemia followed by reperfusion caused significant changes in the neurological and behavioral functions in I/R control animals compared to sham control. Additionally, in the I/R control group there was a substantial decrease in the catalase and superoxide dismutase activities; Likewise, reduced glutathione levels reduced and lipid peroxidation levels enhanced significantly. Also, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and ICAM-I were increased and the levels of IL-10 was decreased significantly. Furthermore, the I/R insult caused increase in brain volume and cerebral infarct formation. Similarly, histopathology of the brain tissue revealed hallmarks like necrosis, leukocyte infiltration, cerebral edema and vascular congestion in I/R control. Notably, MePG (200 and 400 mg/kg) pretreatment for 7 days, has attenuated all the I/R-persuaded pathological changes compared to I/R control. In addition, the LC-MS/MS analysis showed presence of acteoside, apigenin, gallic acid, gossypin, pentagalloyl glucose, quercetin, and rutin as major ingredients in the MePG. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the MePG possesses significant cerebroprotective activity.

30669336|t|Peach Kernel Oil Downregulates Expression of Tissue Factor and Reduces Atherosclerosis in ApoE knockout Mice.
30669336|a|Atherosclerosis is the pathological process in arteries due to the plaque formation that is responsible for several diseases like heart disease, stroke and peripheral arterial disease. In this study, we performed in vitro and in vivo assays to evaluate the potential anti-atherosclerosis activity of peach kernel oil. For the in vitro assay, we incubated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) to induce tissue factors (TF, an essential mediator of hemostasis and trigger of thrombosis) elevation. We found that TNF-α-induced TF elevation was suppressed by peach kernel oil in a dose-dependent manner at both mRNA and protein levels. Peach kernel oil can significantly improve HUVEC viability, protect the endothelial cells, which achieved the goal of prevention of thrombotic diseases. For the in vivo assay, we investigated the effect and mechanism of peach kernel oil on preventing atherosclerotic lesion formation in ApoE knockout mice. Results show that peach kernel oil could reduce total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, elevate the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in serum, and reduce the area of the aortic atherosclerotic lesions in high-fat diet fed ApoE knockout mice. Moreover, peach kernel oil treatment can significantly down regulate the expression of TF protein to inhibit the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. In conclusion, peach kernel oil may be a potential health food to prevent atherosclerosis in cardiovascular diseases.

30223049|t|Achyranthes aspera Linn. alleviates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion-induced neurocognitive, biochemical, morphological and histological alterations in Wistar rats.
30223049|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In the traditional system of Indian medicine, the whole plant and roots of Achyranthes aspera L have been extensively used to treat neurological conditions such as epilepsy and stroke by the various ethnic communities of India. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was aimed to evaluate the cerebroprotective potential of methanol extract of A. aspera aerial parts (MeAA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially the MeAA was evaluated for total phenolic content and subjected to detailed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Additionally, it was evaluated for in vitro antioxidant activity in ferric reducing antioxidant power, 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and oxygen radical absorbance capacity assays. Furthermore, in RAW 264.7 cell lines the effect of MeAA was evaluated on lipopolysaccharide-induced generation of reactive oxygen species, nitrite and tumor necrosis factor-α. Finally, the MeAA (400 and 800 mg/kg) was evaluated against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain injury in rats. In brief, male Wistar rats were allocated in to five groups (G-I to G-V, n = 10). G-I and G-II assigned as sham control and I/R control, and received only vehicle (carboxy methyl cellulose 0.5% w/v, 10 ml/kg, p.o.). G-III received quercetin (20 mg/kg, p.o.) and assigned as reference standard. G-IV and G-V group animals received 400 and 800 mg/kg oral doses of MeAA, respectively. All the treatments were given orally for a period of seven days and the parameters such as functional (neurological, cognitive and motor), morphological (edema and infarct area), biochemical (superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, cytokines), and histopathological evaluations of the brain tissue was performed. RESULTS: The MeAA exhibited 72.48 mg gallic acid equivalents/g of total phenolic content and the LC-MS/MS analysis showed acteoside, apigenin, and pentagalloyl glucose as major ingredients in the MeAA. In in vitro antioxidant assays, the MeAA showed good antioxidant activity with IC50 of 126.50 μg/ml in DPPH assay; FRAP and ORAC values of 759.65 and 979.4 in FRAP and ORAC assays, respectively. Further, the MeAA significantly suppressed the generation of ROS, nitrite and TNF-α in LPS activated RAW 264.7 cell lines. Besides, sixty mins of global cerebral ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion produced considerable alterations in neurobehavioral functions in the I/R control group compared to sham control, with a significant reduction in catalase and superoxide dismutase enzyme activities. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in reduced glutathione levels with increased lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and ICAM-I) increased significantly and those of anti-inflammatory (IL-10) decreased. I/R insult increased the brain volume and aggravated cerebral infarct formation. Histopathological examination of the brain tissue revealed vascular congestion, cerebral edema, leukocyte infiltration, and brain tissue necrosis. Interestingly, seven days pretreatment with MeAA (800 mg/kg, p.o.) has offered significant protection against I/R-induced functional, morphological, biochemical and histopathological alterations in Wistar rats. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the MeAA possesses potent cerebroprotective action through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

29804326|t|Therapeutic effects of dietary intervention on neuroinflammation and brain metabolism in a rat model of photothrombotic stroke.
29804326|a|INTRODUCTION: A possible target for stroke management is modulation of neuroinflammation. Evidence suggests that food components may exert anti-inflammatory properties and thus may reduce stroke-induced brain damage. AIM: To investigate the efficacy of a diet, containing anti-inflammatory ingredients, as treatment for focal ischemic brain damage induced by photothrombotic stroke in the somatosensory cortex of rats. RESULTS: Brain lesions were surrounded by strong astrogliosis on both day 7 and day 21 after stroke and were accompanied by a trend toward globally decreased glucose metabolism on day 7. The investigational diet applied 2 weeks before the ischemia did not affect astrocyte activation on day 7, but reduced it at day 21. The investigational diet applied immediately after the ischemia, increased astrocyte activation on day 7 and completely reversed this effect on day 21. Moreover, postischemic intervention increased glucose metabolism in somatosensory cortex ipsilateral to the lesion on day 7. CONCLUSION: This study reveals potentially beneficial effects of a diet containing elevated amounts of anti-inflammatory nutrients on the recovery from ischemic brain damage. Therefore, dietary intervention can be considered as an adjuvant therapy for recovery from this brain pathology.

30806316|t|Impact of Active Antihyperglycemic Components as Herbal Therapy for Preventive Health Care Management of Diabetes.
30806316|a|Diabetes is a metabolic hyperglycemic condition that progressively develops, effect small and large sensory fibers in the affected population. It has various complications as hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease as well as peripheral neuropathy. Sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, metformin, biguanidine, acarbose and insulin are commonly used drugs for diabetic patients, but these all have certain side effects. Even metformin, that is known as the miracle drug for diabetes has been found to be associated with side effects, as during treatment it involves complications with eyes, kidneys, peripheral nerves, heart and vasculature. In the present article, we hypothesize recent discoveries with respect to active ingredients from Indian medicinal plants i.e., polypeptide-p (protein analogue act as artificial insulin), charantin (a steroidal saponin), momordicin (an alkaloid) and osmotin (ubiquitous plant protein and animal analogue of human adeponectin) possessing anti-hyperglycemic potential for diabetes type II. Therefore, plants as herbal therapy have preventive care of hyperglycemia accompanied with healthy lifestyle which can provide significant decline in the incidences of diabetes in future.

30484473|t|Systematic studies on the in vivo substance basis and the pharmacological mechanism of Acanthopanax Senticosus Harms leaves by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS coupled with a target-network method.
30484473|a|The leaves of Acanthopanax Senticosus Harms (ASL) can be used as a food ingredient and also as raw materials for making tea and wine. As a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), ASL has demonstrated significant effects in the treatment of ischemic stroke, but the substance basis and the pharmacological mechanism of ASL are unclear. In this study, a sensitive and rapid method was constructed for the separation and identification of the absorbed prototype components and metabolites from ASL in rat plasma and brain using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). A database of ASL active ingredients was established, which comprised 27 prototype ingredients and 20 metabolites from the rat plasma and 10 prototype ingredients and 7 metabolites from the rat brain. A comprehensive and effective target-network pharmacological method for tracing co-related targets and pathways between ASL and ischemic stroke was also set up. As a result, 34 targets and 30 pathways were obtained. TNF, NF-κB, IL-6, IL-1B, ICAM, and MMP-9 targets are all critical factors related to ischemic stroke, while the NF-κB signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and arachidonic acid metabolism play significant roles in the development of ischemic stroke. The visualized relationship between ASL and ischemic stroke was demonstrated by compound-target networks and compound-target-pathway networks, which revealed the therapeutic targets around the signaling pathways of ASL in the treatment of ischemic stroke. This research method will open a window for the mechanistic studies of TCM in the treatment of diseases.

30545139|t|Protective Effects and Target Network Analysis of Ginsenoside Rg1 in Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury: A Comprehensive Overview of Experimental Studies.
30545139|a|Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion is a complicated pathological process. The injury and cascade reactions caused by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion are characterized by high mortality, high recurrence, and high disability. However, only a limited number of antithrombotic drugs, such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-TPA), aspirin, and heparin, are currently available for ischemic stroke, and its safety concerns is inevitable which associated with reperfusion injury and hemorrhage. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore and examine some potential neuroprotective agents with treatment for cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury to reduce safety concerns caused by antithrombotic drugs in ischemic stroke. Ginseng Rg1 (G-Rg1) is a saponin composed of natural active ingredients and derived from the roots or stems of Panax notoginseng and ginseng in traditional Chinese medicine. Its pharmacological effects exert remarkable neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system. To explore and summarize the protective effects and mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg1 against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury, we conducted this review, in which we searched the PubMed database to obtain and organize studies concerning the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg1 against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury. This study provides a valuable reference and clues for the development of new agents to combat ischemic stroke. Our summarized review and analysis show that the pharmacological effects of and mechanisms underlying ginsenoside Rg1 activity against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury mainly involve 4 sets of mechanisms: anti-oxidant activity and associated apoptosis via the Akt, Nrf2/HO-1, PPARγ/HO-1, extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways (or mitochondrial apoptosis pathway) and the caspase-3/ROCK1/MLC pathway; anti-inflammatory and immune stimulatory-related activities that involve apoptosis or necrosis via MAPK pathways (the JNK1/2 + ERK1/2 and PPARγ/HO-1 pathways), endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), high mobility group protein1 (HMGB1)-induced TLR2/4/9 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) pathways, and the activation of NF-κB; neurological cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration via the MAPK pathways (JNK1/2 + ERK1/2, PI3K-Akt/mTOR, PKB/Akt and HIF-1α/VEGF pathways); and energy metabolism and the regulation of cellular ATP levels, the blood-brain barrier and other effects via N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, ERS, and AMP/AMPK-GLUT pathways. Collectively, these mechanisms result in significant neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic injury. These findings will be valuable in that they should further promote the development of candidate drugs and provide more information to support the application of previous findings in stroke clinical trials.

30515511|t|Modifying and Validating a Measure of Chronic Stress for People With Aphasia.
30515511|a|Purpose: Chronic stress is likely a common experience among people with the language impairment of aphasia. Importantly, chronic stress reportedly alters the neural networks central to learning and memory-essential ingredients of aphasia rehabilitation. Before we can explore the influence of chronic stress on rehabilitation outcomes, we must be able to measure chronic stress in this population. The purpose of this study was to (a) modify a widely used measure of chronic stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]; Cohen & Janicki-Deverts, 2012) to fit the communication needs of people with aphasia (PWA) and (b) validate the modified PSS (mPSS) with PWA. Method: Following systematic modification of the PSS (with permission), 72 PWA completed the validation portion of the study. Each participant completed the mPSS, measures of depression, anxiety, and resilience, and provided a sample of the stress hormone cortisol extracted from the hair. Pearson's product-moment correlations were used to examine associations between mPSS scores and these measures. Approximately 30% of participants completed the mPSS 1 week later to establish test-retest reliability, analyzed using an interclass correlation coefficient. Results: Significant positive correlations were evident between the reports of chronic stress and depression and anxiety. In addition, a significant inverse correlation was found between reports of chronic stress and resilience. The mPSS also showed evidence of test-retest reliability. No association was found between mPSS score and cortisol level. Conclusion: Although questions remain about the biological correlates of chronic stress in people with poststroke aphasia, significant associations between chronic stress and several psychosocial variables provide evidence of validity of this emerging measure of chronic stress.

30564760|t|Development of an in vitro protein digestibility assay mimicking the chicken digestive tract.
30564760|a|It is difficult to obtain in vivo digestion kinetics data of high protein ingredients using chickens. Collecting kinetics data requires repeated sampling of digesta from the small intestine during the digestion process, which is not easily accomplished due to the anatomical structure of chicken digestive tract. An in vitro technique is proposed for measuring the digestion kinetics of protein sources fed to chickens. The method has a 30 min gastric and 3 h intestinal phase. Five hundred milligram crude protein (CP) equivalent of each meal sample (CP = % N × 6.25) was digested with pepsin (28,260 units) in 50 mL polyethylene centrifuge tubes for 30 min in a shaking water bath (150 strokes/min; 30 mm stroke length) at 41 °C. The 6.5 mL pancreatin was selected as the enzyme concentration for the intestinal phase, during which time 500 μL aliquots were collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 and 240 min. Samples were diluted 1:820 with HCl and sodium acetate buffer, and then mixed with ninhydrin reagent (2:1) at 100 ± 2 °C for 15 min and spectrometric readings taken at 568 nm. To validate the assay, 5 replications of soybean meal (SBM), corn gluten meal (CGM), corn distillers dried grains with solubles (CDDGS), porcine meal (PCM), fish meal (FM) and casein (CA) were digested. The digestion data were modeled with PROC NLIN procedure, and the intra coefficient of variation (CV) assessed using PROC MEANS of SAS 9.4. The digestion values at 180 min were SBM 95 ± 4, FM 93 ± 3, PCM 68 ± 4, CGM 82 ± 3 and CDDGS 70 ± 2. Intra CV for SBM, CGM, CDDGS, PCM and FM were 5%, 5%, 12%, 10% and 2%, respectively. The estimated fractional digestion rates for SBM, CGM, CDDGS, FM and PCM were 0.023, 0.013, 0.009, 0.024 and 0.013, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed in vitro technique estimated the rate and extent of the digestion of CP for the meals with low intra CV.

30459599|t|Assessing the Pharmacological and Therapeutic Efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Liangxue Tongyu Prescription for Intracerebral Hemorrhagic Stroke in Neurological Disease Models.
30459599|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage is a fatal subtype of stroke, with crucial impact on public health. Surgical removal of the hematoma as an early-stage treatment for ICH can't improve long-term prognosis remarkably. Liangxue tongyu prescription (LP), a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula, includes eight ingredients and has been used to treat ICH in the clinical. In the study, we elucidated the pharmacological efficacy and therapeutic efficacy of LP to dissect the mechanism of LP against ICH via network analysis and experimental validation. First, we discovered 34 potential compounds and 146 corresponding targets in LP based on network prediction. 24 signal pathway were obtained by the Clue Go assay based on potential compounds in LP against ICH. Second, we found that LP can not only decreased the level of high sensitive C reactive protein (HS-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), NF-kβ, D-dimmer (D2D), estradiol (E2), S-100B, neuron specific enolase (NSE), and interleukin 1 (IL-1) in plasma on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), but also promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis on the glutamate-induced PC12 cell. The compounds including Taurine, Paeonol, and Ginsenoside Rb1 in LP can activate PI3K/AKT pathway. Third, from the three-factor two-level factorial design, compound combinations in LP, such as Taurine and Paeonol, Taurine and Geniposide, Ginsenoside Rg1, and Ginsenoside Rb1, had first-level interactions on cell proliferation. Compound combinations including Taurine and Paeonol, Ginsenoside Rg1 and Ginsenoside Rb1 had as significant increase in efficiency on inhibiting the apoptosis of PC12 cells at the low concentration and up-regulating of PI3K and AKT. Overall, our results suggested that LP had integrated therapeutic effect on ICH due to activities of anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulation, blood vessel protection, and protection neuron from excitotoxicity based on the way of "multi-component, multi-target, multi-pathway," and compound combination in LP can offer protection neuron from excitotoxicity at the low concentration by activation of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway.

30450069|t|Virtual Reality as a Vehicle to Empower Motor-Cognitive Neurorehabilitation.
30450069|a|In this paper, we advocate the combination of four key ingredients that we believe are necessary to design long-lasting effective treatments for neurorehabilitation: (i) motor-cognitive training, (ii) evidence-based neuroscience principles, in particular those related to body perception, (iii) motivational games, and (iv) empowerment techniques. Then, we propose virtual reality (VR) as the appropriate medium to encompass all the requirements mentioned above. VR is arguably one of the most suitable technologies for neurorehabilitation able to integrate evidence-based neurorehabilitation techniques and neuroscience principles into motivating training approaches that promote self-management by empowering patients to own their recovery process. We discuss the advantages and challenges of such an approach on several exemplary applications and outline directions for future developments. We strongly believe that the combination of positive psychology and positive technology mediated by VR-based interventions can heavily impact the rehabilitation outcomes of motor-cognitive functions along all the stages of the rehabilitation path.

30309346|t|Improving medication adherence in stroke survivors: the intervention development process.
30309346|a|BACKGROUND: Medications targeting stroke risk factors have shown good efficacy, yet adherence is suboptimal. A lack of underlying theory may contribute to the ineffectiveness of eliciting or sustaining behaviour change in many existing interventions targeting medication adherence in stroke. Intervention effectiveness and implementation could be enhanced by consideration of evidence base and theory to drive development. The purpose of this study is to identify appropriate components for a theory-driven and evidence-based medication adherence intervention for stroke survivors. METHODS: The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW), a guide to intervention development, informed our systematic process of intervention development. Our earlier systematic review had identified important determinants of medication adherence that were mapped into the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), with Knowledge, Beliefs about consequences and Emotions found to be more influential. Utilising the BCW facilitated selection of intervention options and behaviour change techniques (BCTs); the active ingredients within an intervention. To further refine BCT selection, APEASE criteria were employed, allowing evaluation of potential BCTs within context: The National Health Service (NHS), United Kingdom (UK). RESULTS: Five intervention functions (Education, Persuasion, Training, Environmental Restructuring and Enablement) and five policy categories (Communication/marketing, Guidelines, Regulation, Environmental/social planning and Service provision) were identified as potential intervention options, underpinned by our systematic review findings. Application of APEASE criteria led to an initial pool of 21 BCTs being reduced to 11 (e.g. Habit Formation, Information about Health Consequences and Action Planning) identified as potential intervention components that would both be feasible and directly target the underlying determinants of stroke survivors' medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Careful consideration of underlying evidence and theory to drive intervention design, facilitated by the BCW, enabled identification of appropriate intervention components. BCTs including Habit Formation, Information about Health Consequences and Self-monitoring of Behaviour were considered potentially effective and appropriate to deliver within the NHS. Having reduced the pool of potential intervention components to a manageable number, it will now be possible to explore the perceived acceptability of selected BCTs in interviews with stroke survivors and healthcare professionals. This approach to intervention development should be generalisable to other chronic conditions and areas of behaviour change (e.g. exercise adherence).

30693344|t|Effects of three flavonoids from an ancient traditional Chinese medicine Radix puerariae on geriatric diseases.
30693344|a|As the worldwide population ages, the morbidity of neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and endocrine diseases, such as diabetes and osteoporosis, continues to increase. The etiology of geriatric diseases is complex, involving the interaction of genes and the environment, which makes effective treatment challenging. Traditional Chinese medicine, unlike Western medicine, uses diverse bioactive ingredients to target multiple signaling pathways in geriatric diseases. Radix puerariae is one of the most widely used ancient traditional Chinese medicines and is also consumed as food. This review summarizes the evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies of the pharmacological effects of the main active components of the tuber of Radix puerariae on geriatric diseases.

30226862|t|Experiences from a multimodal rhythm and music-based rehabilitation program in late phase of stroke recovery - A qualitative study.
30226862|a|BACKGROUND: Rehabilitative stroke interventions based on principles of multimodal stimulation have the potential to profoundly affect neuroplastic processes beyond the sub-acute phase. In order to identify important core mechanisms, there is a need to explore how interventions that combine physical, social, sensory, and cognitively challenging activities are perceived and experienced by the participants. This qualitative study, based on an interpretive interactionist perspective, explored the experiences of stroke survivors who participated in a group-based multimodal rehabilitation program based on rhythm and music. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Within four weeks after completion of the multimodal rehabilitation program, face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted on a single occasion with 15 purposively selected individuals (mean age 65, 8 men, 7 women). The interview duration was between 13 and 44 minutes. Qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach was used to analyze data. Three categories were identified, each containing several sub-categories: To be intellectually challenged (energy-consuming activity and coordinating multiple input and output), Perceived therapeutic benefits (motor skills, cognitive skills, emotional and psychological responses), and Pros and cons with social integration (fellowship, competing with others, and instructor characteristics). From these categories, an overall theme was derived: The multifaceted layers of multimodal stimulation. Enjoying music, being part of a group with peers, a skilled instructor, and being able to manage the challenging movements, were related to positive experiences. In contrast, negative experiences were associated with not being able to perform the exercises, and with group members who dominated the conversational space. CONCLUSION: This study shows that access to a multimodal rehabilitation program with rhythm and music as operating ingredients may contribute to positive experiences for many individuals in a late phase after stroke in terms of motor, cognitive, as well as emotional enhancements. Important components were the music, the social interaction, the challenging exercises, and the skilled instructor.

29777902|t|Chemical characterization and cerebroprotective effect of methanolic root extract of Colebrookea oppositifolia in rats.
29777902|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Colebrookea oppositifolia Smith is one of the extensively used plants to treat neurological conditions such as epilepsy by the various ethnic communities in sub-Himalayan regions of India such as Bhoxa, Tharu and nomadic Gujjars. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to evaluate the cerebroprotective effect of C. oppositifolia methanolic root (MeCO) extract in Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MeCO was characterized for total phenolic content and later subjected for detailed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Further, it was evaluated for in vitro antioxidant activity using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, ferric reducing antioxidant power and oxygen radical absorbance capacity assays. In addition, the MeCO was investigated on generation of ROS, nitrite, and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cell lines. Finally, the cerebroprotective effect of MeCO was examined against global ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain injury in Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were allocated in to five groups (G-I to G-V, n = 10). G-I and G-II served as sham control and I/R control, respectively, and received only vehicle (0.5% w/v carboxy methyl cellulose, 10 ml/kg, p.o.). G-III served as reference standard and received quercetin (20 mg/kg, p.o.). G-IV and G-V animals received 200 and 400 mg/kg oral doses of MeCO, respectively. All the treatments were given for a period of seven days and the parameters such as neurobehavioral (neurological, and cognitive), and motor functions, biochemical (enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, ICAM-I), morphological (cerebral edema and infarct area) and histopathological evaluations were performed. RESULTS: The MeCO showed a total phenolic content of 137.28 mg gallic acid equivalents/g, and LC-MS/MS analysis of MeCO showed presence of acteoside, gossypin, quercetin and ferulic acid as major ingredients (6680.3, 1.55, 3.52 and 431.1 ng/mg). In in vitro antioxidant assays, the MeCO exhibited potent activity with IC50 of 49.10 µg/ml in DPPH assay; FRAP and ORAC values of 1180.5 and 2983.5 respectively. Furthermore, the MeCO significantly inhibited generation of ROS, nitrite and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cell lines. Sixty min of global ischemia with 24 h reperfusion produced substantial alterations in neurobehavioral functions in the I/R control group compared to sham control. In addition, a significant reduction in catalase and superoxide dismutase activities was observed. Moreover, lipid peroxidation increased and reduced glutathione levels decreased significantly. Furthermore, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and ICAM-I) increased significantly and those of anti-inflammatory (IL-10) decreased. I/R insult increased the brain volume and aggravated cerebral infarct formation. Histopathological examination of the rat brain revealed vascular congestion, cerebral edema, leukocyte infiltration, and brain tissue necrosis. Interestingly, seven days pretreatment with MeCO (200 and 400 mg/kg) alleviated all the I/R-induced perturbances (neurobehavioral, and motor functions, biochemical, morphological and histopathological) compared with the I/R control. CONCLUSIONS: The MeCO exhibit potent cerebroprotective activity through its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and hence may be useful in the management of ischemic stroke and associated complications.

30443449|t|Epilepsy and Cannabis: A Literature Review.
30443449|a|Epilepsy is considered to be one of the most common non-communicable neurological diseases especially in low to middle-income countries. Approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy have seizures that are resistant to antiepileptic medications. Clinical trials for the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy have mostly focused on new drug treatments, and result in a significant portion of subjects whose seizures remain refractory to medication. The off-label use of cannabis sativa plant in treating seizures is known since ancient times. The active ingredients of this plant are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), the latter considered safer and more effective in treating seizures, and with less adverse psychotropic effects. Clinical trials prior to two years ago have shown little to no significant effects of cannabis in reducing seizures. These trials seem to be underpowered, with a sample size less than 15. In contrast, more recent studies that have included over 100 participants showed that CBD use resulted in a significant reduction in seizure frequency. Adverse effects of CBD overall appear to be benign, while more concerning adverse effects (e.g., elevated liver enzymes) improve with continued CBD use or dose reduction. In most of the trials, CBD is used in adjunct with epilepsy medication, therefore it remains to be determined whether CBD is itself antiepileptic or a potentiator of traditional antiepileptic medications. Future trials may evaluate the efficacy of CBD in treating seizures due to specific etiologies (e.g., post-traumatic, post-stroke, idiopathic).

29536774|t|An Intersectional Exploration: Experiences of Stroke Prevention in Middle-Aged and Older Arab Muslim Immigrant Women in Canada.
29536774|a|Background Arab immigrants have increasing rates of stroke and uncontrolled stroke risk factors coupled with minimal resources for stroke prevention. Purpose This article describes the results of an interpretive descriptive study about Arab immigrant women's experiences of practicing stroke prevention. We use an intersectionality approach to discuss some of the factors that influenced women's ability to manage their health. Methods Sixteen middle-aged and older Arab Muslim immigrant women were recruited between 2015 and 2016 from two religious centers in an urban Canadian center. Women were between the ages of 45 and 75 years, were living in the community, and had a combination of stroke risk factors. Semi-structured interviews lasting 2-3 h were conducted in Arabic by the primary bilingual researcher. Data analysis was completed in Arabic, with final themes and exemplars translated to English with the support of a certified translator.

30050416|t|Is Environmental Enrichment Ready for Clinical Application in Human Post-stroke Rehabilitation?
30050416|a|Environmental enrichment (EE) has been widely used as a means to enhance brain plasticity mechanisms (e.g., increased dendritic branching, synaptogenesis, etc.) and improve behavioral function in both normal and brain-damaged animals. In spite of the demonstrated efficacy of EE for enhancing brain plasticity, it has largely remained a laboratory phenomenon with little translation to the clinical setting. Impediments to the implementation of enrichment as an intervention for human stroke rehabilitation and a lack of clinical translation can be attributed to a number of factors not limited to: (i) concerns that EE is actually the "normal state" for animals, whereas standard housing is a form of impoverishment; (ii) difficulty in standardizing EE conditions across clinical sites; (iii) the exact mechanisms underlying the beneficial actions of enrichment are largely correlative in nature; (iv) a lack of knowledge concerning what aspects of enrichment (e.g., exercise, socialization, cognitive stimulation) represent the critical or active ingredients for enhancing brain plasticity; and (v) the required "dose" of enrichment is unknown, since most laboratory studies employ continuous periods of enrichment, a condition that most clinicians view as impractical. In this review article, we summarize preclinical stroke recovery studies that have successfully utilized EE to promote functional recovery and highlight the potential underlying mechanisms. Subsequently, we discuss how EE is being applied in a clinical setting and address differences in preclinical and clinical EE work to date. It is argued that the best way forward is through the careful alignment of preclinical and clinical rehabilitation research. A combination of both approaches will allow research to fully address gaps in knowledge and facilitate the implementation of EE to the clinical setting.

30203753|t|Neuroprotective effect of Trichosanthes kirilowii cassia twig on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.
30203753|a|In this study, in-depth observation and investigation of blood-brain barrier permeability and neuroprotective effect of Trichosanthes kirilowii cassia twig particles on rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury were performed. Focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion method, reperfusion was implemented 2 hours after ischemia; qualitative analysis and investigation of trichosanthes kirilowii cassia twig particles in plasma, brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid in normal and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats were done by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS); changes in neurological deficits, cerebral infarction stereometry, blood-brain barrier permeability and histopathological changes of MCAO model rats were observed. Qualitative analysis by HPLC-MS/MS results showed that ingredients, paeoniflorin, albiflorin, liquiritin in Trichosanthes kirilowii cassia twig particles can reach the brain through the blood-brain barrier. In the model group, glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizic acid can be detected in brain tissue or cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, Trichosanthes kirilowii cassia twig particles can significantly lower neurological deficits of rats in middle cerebral artery occlusion model, reduce the Evans blue penetration, contract infarct size, and reduce pathological tissue injury of cerebral ischemia reperfusion. The ingredients of Trichosanthes kirilowii cassia twig particles can reach the brain tissue through the blood-brain barrier and play a role in neuroprotection of rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, which has important research significance and brings scientific experimental, theoretical basis for clinical drug use.

29345255|t|Pure mechanistic analysis of additive neuroprotective effects between baicalin and jasminoidin in ischemic stroke mice.
29345255|a|Both baicalin (BA) and jasminoidin (JA) are active ingredients in Chinese herb medicine Scutellaria baicalensis and Fructus gardeniae, respectively. They have been shown to exert additive neuroprotective action in ischemic stroke models. In this study we used transcriptome analysis to explore the pure therapeutic mechanisms of BA, JA and their combination (BJ) contributing to phenotype variation and reversal of pathological processes. Mice with middle cerebral artery obstruction were treated with BA, JA, their combination (BJ), or concha margaritifera (CM). Cerebral infarct volume was examined to determine the effect of these compounds on phenotype. Using the hippocampus microarray and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software, we exacted the differentially expressed genes, networks, pathways, and functions in positive-phenotype groups (BA, JA and BJ) by comparing with the negative-phenotype group (CM). In the BA, JA, and BJ groups, a total of 7, 4, and 11 specific target molecules, 1, 1, and 4 networks, 51, 59, and 18 canonical pathways and 70, 53, and 64 biological functions, respectively, were identified. Pure therapeutic mechanisms of BA and JA were mainly overlapped in specific target molecules, functions and pathways, which were related to the nervous system, inﬂammation and immune response. The specific mechanisms of BA and JA were associated with apoptosis and cancer-related signaling and endocrine and hormone regulation, respectively. In the BJ group, novel target profiles distinct from mono-therapies were revealed, including 11 specific target molecules, 10 functions, and 10 pathways, the majority of which were related to a virus-mediated immune response. The pure additive effects between BA and JA were based on enhanced action in virus-mediated immune response. This pure mechanistic analysis may provide a clearer outline of the target profiles of multi-target compounds and combination therapies.

29218644|t|Cardiovascular Complications of Marijuana and Related Substances: A Review.
29218644|a|The recreational use of cannabis has sharply increased in recent years in parallel with its legalization and decriminalization in several countries. Commonly, the traditional cannabis has been replaced by potent synthetic cannabinoids and cannabimimetics in various forms. Despite overwhelming public perception of the safety of these substances, an increasing number of serious cardiovascular adverse events have been reported in temporal relation to recreational cannabis use. These have included sudden cardiac death, vascular (coronary, cerebral and peripheral) events, arrhythmias and stress cardiomyopathy among others. Many of the victims of these events are relatively young men with few if any cardiovascular risk factors. However, there are reasons to believe that older individuals and those with risk factors for or established cardiovascular disease are at even higher danger of such events following exposure to cannabis. The pathophysiological basis of these events is not fully understood and likely encompasses a complex interaction between the active ingredients (particularly the major cannabinoid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol), and the endo-cannabinoid system, autonomic nervous system, as well as other receptor and non-receptor mediated pathways. Other complicating factors include opposing physiologic effects of other cannabinoids (predominantly cannabidiol), presence of regulatory proteins that act as metabolizing enzymes, binding molecules, or ligands, as well as functional polymorphisms of target receptors. Tolerance to the effects of cannabis may also develop on repeated exposures at least in part due to receptor downregulation or desensitization. Moreover, effects of cannabis may be enhanced or altered by concomitant use of other illicit drugs or medications used for treatment of established cardiovascular diseases. Regardless of these considerations, it is expected that the current cannabis epidemic would add significantly to the universal burden of cardiovascular diseases.

29580946|t|Research trends in flavonoids and health.
29580946|a|Herein we describe, based on some bibliometric data, how the field of research on flavonoids has evolved over the last 25 years. The number of papers on flavonoids has risen in an exponential manner over these years, much faster than other fields on food constituents. This increase appears to be related to the contemporary explosion of interest in healthy foods, supplements and nutraceuticals. It was also probably triggered by large epidemiological studies on fruits and vegetables, and particularly on flavonoids, consumption and incidence of cancer, stroke and coronary heart disease. The widely distributed flavonols constitute the flavonoid subgroup upon which the greatest interest has been focused, followed by flavanols and more recently by anthocyanidins and other related polyphenols such as resveratrol. Research on isoflavones rapidly emerged in the 1990s but plateaued in the 2000s. In the 1990s flavonoids were mainly considered as the active components of medicinal plants, while from 2000 onward, they switched to be mainly regarded as bioactive food ingredients. We envision a continuation in the growth of research for the coming decade focused on clearly demonstrating the importance of flavonoids for human health.

29867497|t|Pharmacokinetics of Active Components From Guhong Injection in Normal and Pathological Rat Models of Cerebral Ischemia: A Comparative Study.
29867497|a|Background and Objectives: Guhong Injection (GHI) is usually administered for the treatment of stroke in clinics. Aceglutamide and hydroxyl safflower yellow A (HSYA) are its key ingredients for brain protective effect. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of aceglutamide and HSYA under pathological and normal conditions, the pharmacokinetic parameters and characteristics of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and normal rats given the same dosage of GHI were studied compared. Methods: 12 SD rats were divided into two groups, namely, MCAO and normal groups. Both groups were treated with GHI in the same dosage. Plasma samples were collected from the jaw vein at different time points and subsequently tested by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: After administration of GHI, both aceglutamide and HSYA were immediately detected in the plasma. Ninety percent of aceglutamide and HSYA was eliminated within 3 h. For aceglutamide, statistically significant differences in the parameters including AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), AUMC(0-t), AUMC(0-∞), Cmax (P < 0.01), and Vz (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, compared with the MCAO group, in the normal group, the values of AUC(0-t), AUMC(0-t), VRT(0-t), and Cmax (P < 0.01) for HSYA were significantly higher, whereas the value of MRT(0-t) was significantly lower in the normal group. Conclusions: The in vivo trials based on the different models showed that, the pharmacokinetic behaviors and parameters of aceglutamide and HSYA in GHI were completely different. These results suggest that the pathological damage of ischemia-reperfusion has a significant impact on the pharmacokinetic traits of aceglutamide and HSYA.

29902908|t|[Pharmacokinetics of main activ ingredients of Guhong injection in cerebral ischemia rats].
29902908|a|To investigate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of active constituents of Guhong injection in rats with cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established in our studies, and then all the rats received iv administration of Guhong injection (2.1 mL·kg⁻¹). The blood concentrations of aceglutamide and hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method at different time points. The concentration-time curves were drawn and pharmacokinetic data were obtained by DAS 3.2.6 software. The results showed that aceglutamide and HSYA showed good linear relationship within the ranges of 1.5-500 mg·L⁻¹ (R²=0.997 5) and 0.33-40 mg·L⁻¹ (R²=0.998 9) respectively. This quantitative method showed a high recovery rate, good precision and stability. The main pharmacokinetics parameters of t1/2α, t1/2β, CL₁, CL₂, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Vd1, and Vd2 were (0.139±0.007) and (0.155±0.017) h, (0.803±0.046) and (2.233±0.410) h, (0.016±0) and (0.149±0.018) L·h⁻¹·kg⁻¹, (0.015±0.001) and (0.446±0.016) L·h⁻¹·kg⁻¹, (133.335±3.844) and (9.298±0.179) mg·h·L⁻¹, (143.851±3.595) and (14.464±1.451) mg·h·L⁻¹, (0.009±0.001) and (0.223±0.007) L·kg⁻¹, (0.006±0.001) and (0.212±0.032) L·kg⁻¹, respectively. The results showed that the established HPLC method was highly specific, and could be used for the simultaneous detection of aceglutamide and HSYA of Guhong injection in MCAO rats, which was conducive to pharmacokinetic studies. Pharmacokinetic data and parameters could provide reference for continuous administration and interval administration of the drug.

29681850|t|Tnfrsf12a-Mediated Atherosclerosis Signaling and Inflammatory Response as a Common Protection Mechanism of Shuxuening Injection Against Both Myocardial and Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injuries.
29681850|a|Shuxuening injection (SXNI) is a widely prescribed herbal medicine of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGB) for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases in China. However, its curative effects on ischemic stroke and heart diseases and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Taking an integrated approach of RNA-seq and network pharmacology analysis, we compared transcriptome profiles of brain and heart ischemia reperfusion injury in C57BL/6J mice to identify common and differential target genes by SXNI. Models for myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) by ligating left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) for 30 min ischemia and 24 h reperfusion and cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI) by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min ischemia and 24 h reperfusion were employed to identify the common mechanisms of SXNI on both cerebral and myocardial ischemia reperfusion. In the CIRI model, ischemic infarct volume was markedly decreased after pre-treatment with SXNI at 0.5, 2.5, and 12.5 mL/kg. In the MIRI model, pre-treatment with SXNI at 2.5 and 12.5 mL/kg improved cardiac function and coronary blood flow and decreased myocardial infarction area. Besides, SXNI at 2.5 mL/kg also markedly reduced the levels of LDH, AST, CK-MB, and CK in serum. RNA-seq analysis identified 329 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brain and 94 DEGs in heart after SXNI treatment in CIRI or MIRI models, respectively. Core analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that atherosclerosis signaling and inflammatory response were top-ranked in the target profiles for both CIRI and MIRI after pre-treatment with SXNI. Specifically, Tnfrsf12a was recognized as an important common target, and was regulated by SXNI in CIRI and MIRI. In conclusion, our study showed that SXNI effectively protects brain and heart from I/R injuries via a common Tnfrsf12a-mediated pathway involving atherosclerosis signaling and inflammatory response. It provides a novel knowledge of active ingredients of Ginkgo biloba on cardio-cerebral vascular diseases in future clinical application.

29508403|t|From intuition to intervention: developing an intonation-based treatment for autism.
29508403|a|Autism affects ∼1.5% of children under age 8; its core symptoms include impairment in social-communicative functioning and repetitive behaviors/restricted interests. Music-based interventions have been considered one modality through which to treat autism. This report discusses considerations to take into account when developing a music-based intervention for a core symptom of autism. Treatment modality must be matched to symptom both clinically and theoretically, the behavior to be treated must be carefully defined and assessed, and outcome measures must be capable of showing improvement in that behavior over the course of the study. Fidelity assessment and rater blinding reduce experimenter bias. High inter-rater reliability for perceptually determined outcome measures helps obtain accurate estimates of treatment response. Later stages of testing compare the experimental intervention to matched control treatments or other validated therapies, isolating the intervention's "active ingredients." Such systematic investigation of a new music-based intervention can provide information of different types, ranging from an assessment of whether the intervention has any effect at all to an assessment of its outcomes and risks in uncontrolled community settings. Findings ultimately compose the evidence base that clinicians and families can use to decide the most effective way of addressing symptoms of autism for particular children.

29470134|t|The Effect of Aronia Berry on Type 1 Diabetes In Vivo and In Vitro.
29470134|a|The number of diabetic patients worldwide is increasing, and complications such as stroke and cardiovascular disease are becoming a serious cause of death. Diabetes mellitus is classified into two types according to the etiopathogenic mechanism and insulin dependence. Type 1 diabetes (T1D), an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is caused by damage and destruction of pancreatic β cells that produce insulin. It is a disease that is characterized by hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia. Aronia berry has been used as a medicinal food in Europe. Aronia contains a variety of ingredients such as polyphenols, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and tannins. Especially, anthocyanin content in aronia berry is known to be much higher than in other plants and berries. It is known for exerting antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and anti-aging effects. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of aronia berry extract intake in multiple low-dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D and to confirm the functional properties of aronia berry. ICR mice (6-week male) were divided into four groups: control (normal control group), STZ (100 mg/kg of STZ-induced T1D group), AR 10 (STZ with oral administration of aronia 10 mg/kg), and AR 100 (STZ with oral administration of aronia 100 mg/kg). Afterward, STZ was injected in a single dose to induce T1D, and the extract was orally administered daily. Dietary intake and body weight were measured twice a week. We confirmed that aronia berry has the effect of decreasing the increase of blood glucose level and also has the protection effect of pancreas β cell (RINm5F cell). This study confirms the anti-diabetic activity of aronia berry, and it can be expected to increase the utilization according to the results.

28071962|t|The Feasibility of Functional Electrical Stimulation to Improve Upper Extremity Function in a Two-year-old Child with Perinatal Stroke: A Case Report.
28071962|a|AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility (i.e. tolerability, adherence) of functional electrical stimulation (FES) for the upper extremity (UE) in a two-year-old child with perinatal stroke. METHODS: Forty hours of FES over eight weeks was prescribed. FES to the hemiplegic triceps, extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis, extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor digitorum was timed with reaching during play. Assessments were performed before, during, and two months post-intervention. UE function (Melbourne Assessment 2 (MA2), Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA)) and spasticity (Modified Tardieu with electrogoniometry and electromyography) were measured. The mother completed a semi-structured interview post-intervention. Descriptive statistics were used for adherence and UE measures. A repeated-measures ANOVA compared Modified Tardieu parameters (e.g. catch angle) over time. Conventional content analysis was used for the interview data. RESULTS: The child completed 39.2/40 hours. Immediately post-intervention, improvements were observed on MA2's Range of Motion subscale and catch angle (Modified Tardieu, p < 0.001). Two months post-intervention, improvements were observed on MA2's Accuracy and Fluency subscales. No change in AHA score occurred. Three themes emerged from the interview: (1) Ingredients for program success; (2) Information about the FES device; and (3) The child's response. CONCLUSIONS: UE FES was feasible in a two-year-old child with hemiplegia.

29375698|t|An oral formulation of cilostazol nanoparticles enhances intestinal drug absorption in rats.
29375698|a|Cilostazol (CLZ) is an anti-platelet agent that is generally used after the onset of cerebral infarction. However, CLZ is a poorly water-soluble drug and a strategy for increasing its bioavailability is required. In the present study, novel oral formulations were designed containing CLZ solid nanoparticles to improve bioavailability. The present study investigated the therapeutic effect of the oral formulations containing CLZ nanoparticles on ischemic stroke using a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury model (MCAO/reperfusion mice). The oral formulation containing CLZ nanoparticles (CLZ/Rnano tablet) was prepared using a combination of recrystallization and ball milling with the following ingredients: CLZ, docusate sodium, methylcellulose, 2-hydoxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, gum arabic, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and mannitol. The particle size after re-dispersion of the CLZ/Rnano tablet was 64±47 nm (mean ± standard deviation). The CLZ areas under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and mean residence time (MRT) in rats that were administered CLZ/Rnano tablets were significantly greater compared with those in rats that were administered CLZ/Rmicro tablets. Results indicated, the AUC after administration of CLZ/Rnano tablets was 3.1-fold higher compared with that after administration of the commercially available CLZ OD tablet. In addition, oral administration with CLZ/Rnano tablets ameliorated neurological deficits caused by ischemic stroke in MCAO/reperfusion mice. It is possible that the oral formulation containing CLZ nanoparticles will be useful for the treatment of patients with ischemic stroke and that these findings will provide significant information that can be used to improve the drug with low bioavailability.

28677236|t|The Test of Masticating and Swallowing Solids (TOMASS): reliability, validity and international normative data.
28677236|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical swallowing assessment is largely limited to qualitative assessment of behavioural observations. There are limited quantitative data that can be compared with a healthy population for identification of impairment. The Test of Masticating and Swallowing Solids (TOMASS) was developed as a quantitative assessment of solid bolus ingestion. AIMS: This research programme investigated test development indices and established normative data for the TOMASS to support translation to clinical dysphagia assessment. METHODS & PROCEDURES: A total of 228 healthy adults (ages 20-80+ years) stratified by age and sex participated in one or more of four consecutive studies evaluating test-retest and interrater reliability and validity to instrumental assessment. For each study the test required participants to ingest a commercially available cracker with instructions to 'eat this as quickly as is comfortably possible'. Further averaged measures were derived including the number of masticatory cycles and swallows per bite, and time per bite, masticatory cycle and swallow. Initial analyses identified significant differences on salient measures between two commercially available crackers that are nearly identical in shape, size and ingredients, suggesting the need for separate normative samples for specific regional products. Additional analyses on a single cracker identified that the TOMASS was sensitive at detecting changes in performance based on age and sex. Test-retest reliability across days and interrater reliability between clinicians was high, as was validation of observational measures to instrumental correlates of the same behaviours. Therefore, normative data are provided for the TOMASS from a minimum of 80 healthy controls, stratified by age and sex, for each of seven commercially available crackers from broad regions worldwide. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Analyses on a single cracker identified Arnott's Salada, and that TOMASS measures were sensitive for detecting changes in performance based on age and sex. Interrater and test-retest reliability across days were high, as was validation of observational measures to instrumental correlates of the same behaviours. Significant differences were identified between two commercially available crackers, nearly identical in shape, size and ingredients, thus normative samples for specific regional products were required. Normative data were then acquired for the TOMASS from a minimum of 80 healthy controls, stratified by age and sex, for each of seven commercially available crackers from broad regions worldwide. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: The TOMASS is presented as a valid, reliable and broadly normed clinical assessment of solid bolus ingestion. Clinical application may help identify dysphagic patients at bedside and provide a non-invasive, but sensitive, measure of functional change in swallowing.

28885137|t|Effects of reducing processed culinary ingredients and ultra-processed foods in the Brazilian diet: a cardiovascular modelling study.
28885137|a|OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of reducing saturated fat, trans-fat, salt and added sugar from processed culinary ingredients and ultra-processed foods in the Brazilian diet on preventing cardiovascular deaths by 2030. DESIGN: A modelling study. SETTING: Data were obtained from the Brazilian Household Budget Survey 2008/2009. All food items purchased were categorized into food groups according to the NOVA classification. We estimated the energy and nutrient profile of foods then used the IMPACT Food Policy model to estimate the reduction in deaths from CVD up to 2030 in three scenarios. In Scenario A, we assumed that the intakes of saturated fat, trans-fat, salt and added sugar from ultra-processed foods and processed culinary ingredients were reduced by a quarter. In Scenario B, we assumed a reduction of 50 % of the same nutrients in ultra-processed foods and processed culinary ingredients. In Scenario C, we reduced the same nutrients in ultra-processed foods by 75 % and in processed culinary ingredients by 50 %. RESULTS: Approximately 390 400 CVD deaths might be expected in 2030 if current mortality patterns persist. Under Scenarios A, B and C, CVD mortality can be reduced by 5·5, 11·0 and 29·0 %, respectively. The main impact is on stroke with a reduction of approximately 6·0, 12·6 and 32·0 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial potential exists for reducing the CVD burden through overall improvements of the Brazilian diet. This might require reducing the penetration of ultra-processed foods by means of regulatory policies, as well as improving the access to and promotion of fresh and minimally processed foods.

30109827|t|Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases with Anti-Inflammatory and Anti- Oxidant Nutraceuticals and Herbal Products: An Overview of Pre-Clinical and Clinical Studies.
30109827|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammation-induced endothelial abnormalities, dietary habits, and tobacco smoking are considered to be the primary risk factors for causing atherosclerosis and Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs), including Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disorders, peripheral arterial disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart defects, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Prevention of CVDs with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agents has been a challenging task for decades. Currently, CVDs have taken a top position among the health-related issues and are considered the foremost cause of mortality and morbidity around the globe. OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence from several sources indicates that nutraceuticals and plant products may be a cost-effective approach for the prevention of CVDs. A limited number of clinical studies done with nutraceuticals have shown positive effects for promoting health and well-being as well as reduction of CVDs in humans. Some plants from which nutraceutical ingredients are isolated and will be discussed in this review are: Murraya koenigii, Curcuma longa, Beta vulgaris, Allium sativum, Allium cepa, Lagenaria siceraria Stand, Trigonella foenum-graecum. METHODS: Literature searches were done using keywords for plants, nutraceuticals, and plant products that have revealed beneficial effects in the prevention of CVDs. The anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of nutraceuticeuticals and plant ingredients play a significant role in capturing free radicals and reducing endothelial risk factors associated with the occurrence CVDs. RESULTS: This review has explored the usefulness of animal studies performed with nutraceuticals and herbal products and to understand their mode of action in the prevention of CVDs. Also, we have referred to patents for different nutraceuticals for better understanding their quantitative effects and dosage forms. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that nutraceuticals possess enormous health benefits and their interventions can be highly beneficial in the prevention/reduction of CVDs and related disorders such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart attack and stroke. The findings of this review provide an update on the emerging uses of nutraceuticals, functional foods, and herbal remedies in humans. Nevertheless, large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials are needed to confirm the health benefit claims about nutraceuticals and herbal products to establish their long-term safety and to resolve the controversy about the role of clinical nutrition in curing lifestyle diseases.

29383171|t|Synergistic neuroprotective effects of Danshensu and hydroxysafflor yellow A on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.
29383171|a|Ischemic stroke is a common cerebrovascular disease with substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, therapeutic options to minimize the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury are limited. In China, combination of herb Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge) and Honghua (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is effective for stroke treatment in patients but its underlying mechanism requires further investigation. Our study was conducted to evaluate and explore the synergistic effects of two herb ingredients Danshensu and hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Rats were randomly assigned to the following five groups: sham group, model group, Danshensu group, HSYA group, and Danshensu+HSYA group. Under our experimental conditions in vitro, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model was established to determine the synergistic neuroprotective effects of Danshensu and HSYA. With such methods as neurological deficits scoring, TTC, HE and TUNEL staining, and ELISA detection, the results demonstrated that administration of either Danshensu or HSYA improved neurological defects and alleviated pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress reactions. Notably, combination of Danshensu and HSYA exerted more effective results than that used alone. Furthermore, western blot analysis results showed that Danshensu and HSYA combination displayed synergistic regulation on TLR4/NF-κB and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. Consistently, Danshensu +HSYA group exhibits better neuroprotection in primary neurons with OGD model compared with Danshensu or HSYA group. Taken together, we found for the first time that Danshensu plus HSYA could achieve remarkable synergistic neuroprotective effects on I/R injury, which is related to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways.

29245245|t|Therapeutic effect of Chinese herbal medicines for post stroke recovery: A traditional and network meta-analysis.
29245245|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is a condition with high morbidity and mortality, and 75% of stroke survivors lose their ability to work. Stroke is a burden to the family and society. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese herbal patent medicines in the treatment of patients after the acute phase of a stroke. METHODS: We searched the following databases through August 2016: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), China Science Periodical Database (CSPD), and China Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc) for studies that evaluated Chinese herbal patent medicines for post stroke recovery. A random-effect model was used to pool therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal patent medicines on stroke recovery. Network meta-analysis was used to rank the treatment for each Chinese herbal patent medicine. RESULTS: In our meta-analysis, we evaluated 28 trials that included 2780 patients. Chinese herbal patent medicines were effective in promoting recovery after stroke (OR, 3.03; 95% CI: 2.53-3.64; P < .001). Chinese herbal patent medicines significantly improved neurological function defect scores when compared with the controls (standard mean difference [SMD], -0.89; 95% CI, -1.44 to -0.35; P = .001). Chinese herbal patent medicines significantly improved the Barthel index (SMD, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-0.94; P < .001) and the Fugl-Meyer assessment scores (SMD, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34-0.86; P < .001). In the network analysis, MLC601, Shuxuetong, and BuchangNaoxintong were most likely to improve stroke recovery in patients without acupuncture. Additionally, Mailuoning, Xuesaitong, BuchangNaoxintong were the patented Chinese herbal medicines most likely to improve stroke recovery when combined with acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that the Chinese herbal patent medicines were effective for stroke recovery. The most effective treatments for stroke recovery were MLC601, Shuxuetong, and BuchangNaoxintong. However, to clarify the specific effective ingredients of Chinese herbal medicines, a well-designed study is warranted.

29133791|t|Network pharmacology exploration reveals endothelial inflammation as a common mechanism for stroke and coronary artery disease treatment of Danhong injection.
29133791|a|Although Danhong injection (DHI) is the most widely prescribed Chinese medicine for both stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD), its underlying common molecular mechanisms remain unclear. An integrated network pharmacology and experimental verification approach was used to decipher common pharmacological mechanisms of DHI on stroke and CAD treatment. A compound-target-disease & function-pathway network was constructed and analyzed, indicating that 37 ingredients derived from DH (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge., Flos Carthami tinctorii and DHI) modulated 68 common targets shared by stroke and CAD. In-depth network analysis results of the top diseases, functions, pathways and upstream regulators implied that a common underlying mechanism linking DHI's role in stroke and CAD treatment was inflammatory response in the process of atherosclerosis. Experimentally, DHI exerted comprehensive anti-inflammatory effects on LPS, ox-LDL or cholesterol crystal-induced NF-κB, c-jun and p38 activation, as well as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 secretion in vascular endothelial cells. Ten of 14 predicted ingredients were verified to have significant anti-inflammatory activities on LPS-induced endothelial inflammation. DHI exerts pharmacological efficacies on both stroke and CAD through multi-ingredient, multi-target, multi-function and multi-pathway mode. Anti-endothelial inflammation therapy serves as a common underlying mechanism. This study provides a new understanding of DHI in clinical application on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

28902880|t|Cost and cost-effectiveness of a school-based education program to reduce salt intake in children and their families in China.
28902880|a|OBJECTIVE: The School-based Education Program to Reduce Salt Intake in Children and Their Families study was a cluster randomized control trial among grade five students in 28 primary schools and their families in Changzhi, China. It achieved a significant effect in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in all family adults by 2.3 mmHg and in elderlies (aged > = 60 years) by 9.5 mmHg. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of this salt reduction program. METHODS: Costs of the intervention were assessed using an ingredients approach to identify resource use. A trial-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated based on the observed effectiveness in lowering SBP. A Markov model was used to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention, and then based on population data, extrapolated to a scenario where the program is scaled up nationwide. Findings were presented in terms of an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The perspective was that of the health sector. RESULTS: The intervention cost Int$19.04 per family and yielded an ICER of Int$2.74 (90% CI: 1.17-12.30) per mmHg reduction of SBP in all participants (combining children and adult participants together) compared with control group. If scaled up nationwide for 10 years and assumed deterioration in treatment effect of 50% over this period, it would reach 165 million families and estimated to avert 42,720 acute myocardial infarction deaths and 107,512 stroke deaths in China. This would represent a gain of 635,816 QALYs over 10-year time frame, translating into Int$1,358 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Based on WHO-CHOICE criteria, our analysis demonstrated that the proposed salt reduction strategy is highly cost-effective, and if scaled up nationwide, the benefits could be substantial.

28885973|t|Hemorrhagic Stroke in a Young Healthy Male Following Use of Pre-Workout Supplement Animal Rage XL.
28885973|a|So-called "pre-workout" supplements are substances marketed as natural dietary supplements with claims of helping athletes achieve more focused and intense workouts. The use of such products remains popular among American youth as a whole, but is especially high among active duty service members. Supplements are minimally regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and unlike pharmaceuticals, supplements are often brought to market without any testing to show neither efficacy nor safety. Several case reports have documented serious adverse events and raise the question of whether supplement use was a causative factor. Reported events occurring after use of pre-workout supplements include, among others, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, hepatitis, and death. Here, we present the case of a healthy 25-year-old active duty male who experienced a bilateral cerebellar hemorrhagic stroke occurring shortly after taking a supplement named Animal Rage XL. Hemorrhagic stroke occurring in a healthy 25-year-old male with no risk factors is exceedingly rare. This is the first known case of stroke temporally associated with this particular supplement, which is currently available for purchase at military exchanges. Additionally, several of the active ingredients in this supplement have been shown to cause hypertension, tachycardia, and vasospasm. All of these effects could increase the likelihood and severity of a hemorrhagic stroke. The investigated ingredients in this abstract include β-phenethylamine, creatine-monophosphate, and caffeine.

28190603|t|Neuroprotective Effects of a Novel Antioxidant Mixture Twendee X in Mouse Stroke Model.
28190603|a|BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress and inflammation are important aggravating factors in acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of a novel antioxidant mixture Twendee X containing multiple antioxidative ingredients, such as coenzyme Q10, ascorbic acid, and cystine, were evaluated. After the pretreatment of a vehicle or Twendee X (20 mg/kg/d) for 14 days, mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion for 60 minutes and further treated with vehicle or Twendee X for 1 or 5 days. RESULTS: Twendee X administration reduced the infarct size, and reduced oxidative stress markers such as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (one of advanced glycation end products), as well as inflammatory markers such as ionized calcium binding adapter molecule-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of Twendee X were shown on transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mice via antioxidative and anti-inflammatory pathways, providing a potential of Twendee X as one preventive and therapeutic treatment.

28490880|t|Protective efficacy of a single salvianolic acid A treatment on photothrombosis-induced sustained spatial memory impairments.
28490880|a|With respect to the high burden of ischemic stroke and the absence of pharmacological treatment for promoting rehabilitation, promising candidates with specific effects on long-term functional recovery are highly desired. Candidates need reasonable experimental paradigms to evaluate the long-term functional outcome focused on ischemia-induced sensorimotor and memory deficits. "Danshen", a traditional Chinese herb, has long been used to treat coronary and cerebral vascular diseases as well as dementia. Salvianolic acid A (SAA), one of the major active ingredients of Danshen, was demonstrated to be effective in protecting against cerebral ischemic injury. Here, employing an experimental stroke model induced by photothrombosis in the unilateral frontal cortex of rats, we investigated whether SAA has long-term protective effects on ischemia-induced sensorimotor and memory deficits in our behavioral tests. The results indicated that a single SAA treatment improved the cortical ischemia-induced sensorimotor deficits during 15 days' cylinder test period, and alleviated ischemia-induced sustained spatial memory impairments during the 2 months' dependent Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests. In addition, either ischemic injury or SAA treatment did not show any changes compared with sham group in other behavioral tests including rotarod tests, swimming speed in MWM tests, open field tests, elevated plus maze tests, treadmill tests and forced swimming tests. The results reveal that the cognitive deficits are not the results of animal's anxiety or confounding motor impairments. Overall, the present paradigm appears suitable for the preclinical evaluation of the long-term effects of pharmacological treatments on ischemic stroke. Meanwhile, SAA might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of memory deficits associated with ischemic stroke.

28236683|t|Extraction and isolation of potential anti-stroke compounds from flowers of Pueraria lobata guided by in vitro PC12 cell model.
28236683|a|A simple and efficient method based on ultrafiltration liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS) was applied to rapidly screen and identify ligands for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from the flowers of Pueraria lobata, and the compounds were assessed for anti-stroke activity using a PC12 cell model. Seven major isoflavones, kakkalide, 3'-hydroxy puerarin, puerarin, puerarin xyloside, tectoridin, tectorigenin, and ononin, were identified as potent LDH inhibitors. A continuous online method, which consisted of microwave-assisted extraction and countercurrent chromatography (MAE-CCC), was newly developed for scaled-up production of these compounds with high purity and efficiency. This novel approach, using UFLC-MS coupled with MAE-CCC and a PC12 cell model, provided a powerful tool for screening, extraction, and separation of LDH inhibitors from complex samples, and a useful platform for the large-scale production of functional food and nutraceutical ingredients.

28049027|t|An integrated shotgun proteomics and bioinformatics approach for analysis of brain proteins from MCAO model using serial affinity chromatograph with four active ingredients from Shengmai preparations as ligands.
28049027|a|Identification and validation of disease-relevant target proteins for natural products is an essential component of modern pharmaceutical research. In the present study, an integrated shotgun proteomics and bioinformatics approach was established to profile the interaction of active small molecules derived from ShengMai preparations (SMXZF) with hundreds of endogenously expressed proteins from middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Affinity-based proteomic strategies for isolation and identification of targets for the bioactive components is a classic, but still powerful approach. The proteins bound by SMXZF of the brain tissue proteins from MCAO model via serial affinity chromatograph were analyzed by nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) and all MS/MS spectra were then automatically searched by the SEQUEST program. A total of 154 proteins had been identified, with the molecular weight ranging from 21,369.6 to 332,393.21 and the pI from 4.32 to 10.88. Bioinformatic analysis was also implemented to better understand the identified proteins. In the gene ontology (GO) annotation, all the identified proteins were classified into 39, 18 and 12 groups according to biological process, cellular component and molecular function, respectively. KEGG pathways analysis of the identified proteins was conducted with 46 corresponding pathways found. In addition, the gene network was also constructed to analyze the relationship of these genes each other. Further validation of some targets were performed in MCAO model by Western blotting. The results indeed supported the notion that proteins MAPK/ERK1/2, CaMKII and VIM were involved in the disease development of MCAO and played an essential role in the protective effect of SMXZF. This study highlights the effectiveness and reliability of this integrated shotgun proteomics and bioinformatics approach, which is a promising paradigm for target identification and elucidating the mechanism of natural products in future research.

28243308|t|Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.
28243308|a|Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, which is related to many cardiac and cerebral vascular diseases, especially stroke. It can therefore increase cardiovascular mortality and all-cause death. The current treatments of AF remain to be western drugs and radiofrequency ablation which are limited by the tolerance of patients, adverse side effects, and high recurrence rate, especially for the elderly. On the contrary, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with long history of use involves various treatment methods, including Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) or bioactive ingredients, Chinese patent medicines, acupuncture, Qigong, and Tai Chi Chuan. With more and more researches reported, the active roles of TCM in AF management have been discovered. Then it is likely that TCM would be effective preventive means and valuable additional remedy for AF. The potential mechanisms further found by numerous experimental studies showed the distinct characteristics of TCM. Some CHMs or bioactive ingredients are atrial-selective, while others are multichannel and multifunctional. Therefore, in this review we summarized the treatment strategies reported in TCM, with the purpose of providing novel ideas and directions for AF management.

28894512|t|Treatment Effects of Ischemic Stroke by Berberine, Baicalin, and Jasminoidin from Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) Explored by an Integrated Metabolomics Approach.
28894512|a|Berberine, baicalin, and jasminoidin were major active ingredients of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD), a famous prescription of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which has been used for the treatment of ischemic stroke. The aim of the present study was to classify their roles in the treatment effects of ischemic stroke. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was constructed to mimic ischemic stroke and treatment effects of berberine, baicalin, and jasminoidin, and HLJDD was assessed by neurologic deficit scoring, infarct volume, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and Western blotting. In addition, the 1H NMR metabolomics approach was used to assess the metabolic profiles, which combined with correlation network analysis successfully revealed metabolic disorders in ischemic stroke concerning the treatment of the three principal compounds from HLJDD for the first time. The combined results suggested that berberine, baicalin, and jasminoidin are responsible for the effectiveness of HLJDD on the treatment of ischemic stroke by amelioration of abnormal metabolism and regulation of oxidative stress, neuron autophagy, and inflammatory response. This integrated metabolomics approach showed its potential in understanding the function of complex formulae and clarifying the role of its components in the overall treatment effects.

27771457|t|Identification of NF-κB inhibitors following Shenfu injection and bioactivity-integrated UPLC/Q-TOF-MS and screening for related anti-inflammatory targets in vitro and in silico.
27771457|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shenfu injection (SFI) is a commercial medicinal product approved by the China Food and Drug Administration that is widely used in the treatment of stroke and coronary heart disease. However, the material basis and the mechanism of SFI are not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: With network pharmacology analysis, our research committed to identify the anti-inflammatory ingredients and mechanism of SFI by combining high-throughput screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a bioactivity-based UPLC/Q-TOF-MS method followed by network pharmacology and identified the anti-inflammatory active ingredients of SFI from two different perspectives of network computing and high throughput screening. Then we verified the anti-inflammatory effect of SFI in vitro with endothelial cells. After detecting the cell viability, the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKK), phosphorylated IKK, phosphorylated NF-κB and phosphorylated IκB-α from the supernatant were determined. RESULTS: SFI could significantly suppress inflammatory responses, and the mechanism may be via an NF-κB-dependent pathway. The results of high throughput screening (HTS) revealed that protopanaxadiol glycosides (ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc and Rd), protopanaxatriol glycosides (ginsenosides Rg1, Rg2, Re, Rf and F1), diester-type alkaloids (fuziline and neoline) and aconine derivatives (mesaconine and benzoyl-mesaconine) have anti-NF-κB activity. The three compounds (including benzoyl-mesaconine, fuziline and neoline) are the first reported SFI compounds to have NF-κB inhibitor activity. CONCLUSIONS: SFI may play a critical role in counteracting inflammation through the NF-κB signaling pathway. The active ingredients are protopanaxadiol glycosides, protopanaxatriol glycosides, diester-type alkaloids and aconine derivatives.

27908171|t|Automated detection of white matter hyperintensities of all sizes in cerebral small vessel disease.
27908171|a|PURPOSE: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are seen on FLAIR-MRI in several neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, dementia, Parkinsonism, stroke and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). WMHs are often used as biomarkers for prognosis or disease progression in these diseases, and additionally longitudinal quantification of WMHs is used to evaluate therapeutic strategies. Human readers show considerable disagreement and inconsistency on detection of small lesions. A multitude of automated detection algorithms for WMHs exists, but since most of the current automated approaches are tuned to optimize segmentation performance according to Jaccard or Dice scores, smaller WMHs often go undetected in these approaches. In this paper, the authors propose a method to accurately detect all WMHs, large as well as small. METHODS: A two-stage learning approach was used to discriminate WMHs from normal brain tissue. Since small and larger WMHs have quite a different appearance, the authors have trained two probabilistic classifiers: one for the small WMHs (⩽3 mm effective diameter) and one for the larger WMHs (>3 mm in-plane effective diameter). For each size-specific classifier, an Adaboost is trained for five iterations, with random forests as the basic classifier. The feature sets consist of 22 features including intensities, location information, blob detectors, and second order derivatives. The outcomes of the two first-stage classifiers were combined into a single WMH likelihood by a second-stage classifier. Their method was trained and evaluated on a dataset with MRI scans of 362 SVD patients (312 subjects for training and validation annotated by one and 50 for testing annotated by two trained raters). To analyze performance on the separate test set, the authors performed a free-response receiving operating characteristic (FROC) analysis, instead of using segmentation based methods that tend to ignore the contribution of small WMHs. RESULTS: Experimental results based on FROC analysis demonstrated a close performance of the proposed computer aided detection (CAD) system to human readers. While an independent reader had 0.78 sensitivity with 28 false positives per volume on average, their proposed CAD system reaches a sensitivity of 0.73 with the same number of false positives. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have developed a CAD system with all its ingredients being optimized for a better detection of WMHs of all size, which shows performance close to an independent reader.

27632784|t|The pharmacokinetic screening of multiple components of the Nao Mai Tong formula in rat plasma by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry combined with pattern recognition method and its application to comparative pharmacokinetics.
27632784|a|The Nao Mai Tong formula (NMT) is composed of Rhubarb, Ginseng, Ligusticum wallichii and Pueraria in a ratio of 3:3:2:2 (w/w) and is a well-known traditional Chinese prescription that has been clinically employed for treating ischemia cerebrovascular disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of multiple components (chryohol-8-O-β-D-glucoyroide, physcion-8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rb3, ginsenoside Rc, senkyunolide I, ligustilide puerarin, daidzein, 3'-methoxy puerarin) after the oral administration of the NMT formula in rats. A rapid and sensitive UHPLC-Quadrupole-Orbitrap-MS with a sequential positive and negative ionization mode was developed to determine the 15 absorbed ingredients. After extraction from blood, the analytes and internal standards were subjected to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with Agela Venusil MPC18 (2.1mm×100mm, 3μm, Agela, USA). The mobile phase consisted of methanol and ammonium acetate (3mmolL-1) under gradient elution conditions. This validated method was successfully applied to a comparative pharmacokinetic study of fifteen components in rat plasma after oral administration of the NMT formula or single herb extracts to normal and stroke-afflicted rats. A principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to evaluate the differences in the pharmacokinetic behavior (time-course) of the absorbed components of NMT, and the absorbed components were assigned to 3 separate clusters. A comparison of the body dynamics of each group indicated that cluster B (ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rb3, ginsenoside Rc) might be the most important constituents controlling the pharmacological effects of NMT. The comparative pharmacokinetic study showed that the different groups had different pharmacokinetic characteristics. The pharmacokinetics-based UHPLC Quadrupole-Orbitrap-MS using a full-scan mode combined with a pattern recognition approach can provide a reliable and suitable means of screening and identifying potentially bioactive components that contribute to the pharmacological effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

27459888|t|Mechanistic understanding of the effect of Dengzhan Shengmai capsule on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel in rats.
27459888|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Dengzhan Shengmai capsule (DZSM) is known in China for its remarkable curative effect as a treatment of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. DZSM is a Chinese herbal compound preparation that consists of four ingredients, including Erigeron breviscapus (Vaniot) Hand.-Mazz., Panax ginseng C.A. Mey, Ophiopogon japonicas (Thunb.) Ker-Gawl. and Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill., and was indexed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2010. DZSM and clopidogrel are often co-prescribed in the clinic to prevent the recurrence of stroke or other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, the effect of DZSM on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of the study is to explore the pharmacokinetics and potential interaction between DZSM and clopidogrel and the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were used to investigate the effect of DZSM on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and its active metabolite in vivo. The plasma concentrations were simultaneously determined using LC-MS/MS. The effects of DZSM on the P-gp-mediated efflux transport and CYP450-mediated metabolism of clopidogrel were investigated using MDCKII-MDR1 cells and rat liver microsomes, respectively. RESULTS: After pretreatment with DZSM, the Cmax and AUC0-∞ of clopidogrel increased from 0.4±0.1 to 1.7±0.6ng/mL and 0.9±0.4 to 2.0±0.2ng/mLh, respectively. The Cmax and AUC0-∞ of the derivatized active metabolite of clopidogrel decreased from 8.2±1.2 to 2.8±0.5ng/mL and 18.2±5.6 to 6.4±3.7ngh/mL, respectively. In MDCKII-MDR1 cells, the P-gp-mediated efflux transport of clopidogrel was significantly inhibited by the DZSM extract. In rat liver microsomes, DZSM inhibited clopidogrel metabolism with an IC50 of 0.02mg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: DZSM significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and its active metabolite by inhibiting the P-gp-mediated efflux transport and CYP450-mediated metabolism of clopidogrel. Thus, caution is needed when DZSM is co-administered with clopidogrel in the clinic because the interaction of these drugs may result in altered plasma concentrations of clopidogrel and its active metabolite.

27129676|t|Low-calorie sweetener use and energy balance: Results from experimental studies in animals, and large-scale prospective studies in humans.
27129676|a|For more than a decade, pioneering animal studies conducted by investigators at Purdue University have provided evidence to support a central thesis: that the uncoupling of sweet taste and caloric intake by low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) can disrupt an animal's ability to predict the metabolic consequences of sweet taste, and thereby impair the animal's ability to respond appropriately to sweet-tasting foods. These investigators' work has been replicated and extended internationally. There now exists a body of evidence, from a number of investigators, that animals chronically exposed to any of a range of LCSs - including saccharin, sucralose, acesulfame potassium, aspartame, or the combination of erythritol+aspartame - have exhibited one or more of the following conditions: increased food consumption, lower post-prandial thermogenesis, increased weight gain, greater percent body fat, decreased GLP-1 release during glucose tolerance testing, and significantly greater fasting glucose, glucose area under the curve during glucose tolerance testing, and hyperinsulinemia, compared with animals exposed to plain water or - in many cases - even to calorically-sweetened foods or liquids. Adverse impacts of LCS have appeared diminished in animals on dietary restriction, but were pronounced among males, animals genetically predisposed to obesity, and animals with diet-induced obesity. Impacts have been especially striking in animals on high-energy diets: diets high in fats and sugars, and diets which resemble a highly-processed 'Western' diet, including trans-fatty acids and monosodium glutamate. These studies have offered both support for, and biologically plausible mechanisms to explain, the results from a series of large-scale, long-term prospective observational studies conducted in humans, in which longitudinal increases in weight, abdominal adiposity, and incidence of overweight and obesity have been observed among study participants who reported using diet sodas and other LCS-sweetened beverages daily or more often at baseline. Furthermore, frequent use of diet beverages has been associated prospectively with increased long-term risk and/or hazard of a number of cardiometabolic conditions usually considered to be among the sequelae of obesity: hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, depression, kidney dysfunction, heart attack, stroke, and even cardiovascular and total mortality. Reverse causality does not appear to explain fully the increased risk observed across all of these studies, the majority of which have included key potential confounders as covariates. These have included body mass index or waist circumference at baseline; total caloric intake and specific macronutrient intake; physical activity; smoking; demographic and other relevant risk factors; and/or family history of disease. Whether non-LCS ingredients in diet beverages might have independently increased the weight gain and/or cardiometabolic risk observed among frequent consumers of LCS-sweetened beverages deserves further exploration. In the meantime, however, there is a striking congruence between results from animal research and a number of large-scale, long-term observational studies in humans, in finding significantly increased weight gain, adiposity, incidence of obesity, cardiometabolic risk, and even total mortality among individuals with chronic, daily exposure to low-calorie sweeteners - and these results are troubling.

27503022|t|Ginsenoside Rd Attenuates DNA Damage by Increasing Expression of DNA Glycosylase Endonuclease VIII-like Proteins after Focal Cerebral Ischemia.
27503022|a|BACKGROUND: Ginsenoside Rd (GSRd), one of the main active ingredients in traditional Chinese herbal Panax ginseng, has been found to have therapeutic effects on ischemic stroke. However, the molecular mechanisms of GSRd's neuroprotective function remain unclear. Ischemic stroke-induced oxidative stress results in DNA damage, which triggers cell death and contributes to poor prognosis. Oxidative DNA damage is primarily processed by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Three of the five major DNA glycosylases that initiate the BER pathway in the event of DNA damage from oxidation are the endonuclease VIII-like (NEIL) proteins. This study aimed to investigate the effect of GSRd on the expression of DNA glycosylases NEILs in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. METHODS: NEIL expression patterns were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in both normal and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat models. Survival rate and Zea-Longa neurological scores were used to assess the effect of GSRd administration on MCAO rats. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) damages were evaluated by the way of real-time analysis of mutation frequency. NEIL expressions were measured in both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis. Apoptosis level was quantitated by the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick end labeling assay. RESULTS: We found that GSRd administration reduced mtDNA and nDNA damages, which contributed to an improvement in survival rate and neurological function; significantly up-regulated NEIL1 and NEIL3 expressions in both mRNA and protein levels of MCAO rats; and reduced cell apoptosis and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in rats at 7 days after MCAO. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the neuroprotective function of GSRd for acute ischemic stroke might be partially explained by the up-regulation of NEIL1 and NEIL3 expressions.

27302874|t|Chemometrics Tools in Detection and Quantitation of the Main Impurities Present in Aspirin/Dipyridamole Extended-Release Capsules.
27302874|a|Aspirin (ASP) and dipyridamole (DIP) in combination is widely used in the prevention of secondary events after stroke and transient ischemic attack. Salicylic acid is a well-known impurity of ASP, and the DIP extended-release formulation may contain ester impurities originating from the reaction with tartaric acid. UV spectral data analysis of the active ingredients in the presence of their main impurities is presented using multivariate approaches. Four chemometric-assisted spectrophotometric methods, namely, partial least-squares, concentration residuals augmented classical least-squares (CRACLS), multivariate curve resolution (MCR) alternating least-squares (ALS), and artificial neural networks, were developed and validated. The quantitative analyses of all the proposed calibrations were compared by percentage recoveries, root mean square error of prediction, and standard error of prediction. In addition, r(2) values between the pure and estimated spectral profiles were used to evaluate the qualitative analysis of CRACLS and MCR-ALS. The lowest error was obtained by the CRACLS model, whereas the best correlation was achieved using MCR-ALS. The four multivariate calibration methods could successfully be applied for the extended-release formulation analysis. The application results were also validated by analysis of the stored dosage-form solution, which showed a susceptibility of DIP esterification in the extended-release formulation. Statistical comparison between the proposed and official methods showed no significant difference.

26832326|t|Neuroprotective effects of (-)-linalool against oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced neuronal injury.
26832326|a|(-)-Linalool, a major component of many essential oils, is widely used in cosmetics and flavoring ingredients as well as in traditional medicines. Although various in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that (-)-linalool has anti-convulsant, anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, its anti-ischemic/hypoxic effects have yet to be determined. This study assessed the neuroprotective effects of (-)-linalool against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced cortical neuronal injury, an in vitro model of ischemic stroke. (-)-Linalool significantly attenuated OGD/R-evoked cortical neuronal injury/death, although it did not inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. (-)-Linalool significantly reduced intracellular oxidative stress during OGD/R-induced injury, as well as scavenging peroxyl radicals (Trolox equivalents or TE = 3.8). This anti-oxidant effect was found to correlate with the restoration of OGD/R-induced decreases in the activities of SOD and catalase. In addition, (-)-linalool inhibited microglial migration induced by monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a chemokine released by OGD/R. These findings show that (-)-linalool has neuroprotective effects against OGD/R-induced neuronal injury, which may be due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Detailed examination of the anti-ischemic mechanisms of (-)-linalool may indicate strategies for the development of drugs to treat cerebral ischemic injury.

26657497|t|Anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic effect of a traditional herbal medicine Kyung-Ok-Ko.
26657497|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Kyung-Ok-Ko (KOK), a traditional herbal prescription, contains six main ingredients; Rehmannia glutinosa var. purpurae, Lycium chinense, Aquillaria agallocha, Poria cocos, Panax ginseng, and honey. KOK has been widely taken as a traditional oriental medicine for improving blood circulation or age-related symptoms, such as dementia and stroke. However, the effect of KOK on platelet activity has not been clarified. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the effect of KOK on platelet function, we evaluated its effect on functional markers of platelet activation such as aggregation and shape change. As a mechanism study for the effect of KOK, we examined its effect on granule secretion, intracellular Ca(2+) increase, and PLCγ and Akt activation. To investigate the effect of orally administered KOK (0.5, 1, 2 g/kg), we examined its ex vivo effect on platelet aggregation in rat, and its in vivo anti-thrombotic effect in mice thromboembolism model. Furthermore, the effect of KOK on bleeding time was examined to estimate its potential side effect. RESULTS: KOK (0.3, 1, 3, 10 mg/ml) inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation and shape change in rat platelets in a concentration-dependent manner. The mechanism for the anti-platelet effect of KOK seems to involve the inhibition of ATP release, intracellular Ca(2+) elevation, and the phosphorylation of PLCγ and Akt. In rat ex vivo study, KOK (2 g/kg, p.o. for 1 day, and 0.5, 1, 2 g/kg, p.o. for 7 days) also had significant inhibitory effects on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In addition, KOK showed a significant protective effect against thrombosis attack in mice. The prolongation of bleeding time by KOK was much less than that by ASA, suggesting a beneficial potential of KOK than ASA in view of side effect. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that KOK elicits remarkable anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic effects with less side effect of bleeding, and therefore, it may have a therapeutic potential for the prevention of platelet-associated cardiovascular diseases.

RECENT FINDINGS: Weight reduction, low-risk diet, regular physical activity, smoking cessation, and low-to-moderate alcohol consumption may reduce stroke risk up to 50% or more, but level one evidence is still lacking for several interventions. Appropriate food ingredients can significantly decrease stroke risk as recently confirmed for Mediterranean diet. The optimal intensity and amount of physical exercise is still not well established before and after stroke, although modest levels of activity already show benefits. Passive smoking represents an important health hazard. The impact of tobacco withdrawal using e-cigarette is currently uncertain. Alcohol and stroke risk relation is probably J-shaped for ischaemic stroke and linear for intracranial haemorrhage. Coffee consumption is J-shaped for overall stroke. Several interventions have failed to show significant effects, including regular intake of 'healthy' forms of fatty acids, various vitamin supplements, and other antioxidants. Both individualized and public educational programmes are likely needed on a repetitive basis to induce and maintain a healthy lifestyle before or after a stroke.

27123036|t|Identification of "Multiple Components-Multiple Targets-Multiple Pathways" Associated with Naoxintong Capsule in the Treatment of Heart Diseases Using UPLC/Q-TOF-MS and Network Pharmacology.
27123036|a|Naoxintong capsule (NXT) is a commercial medicinal product approved by the China Food and Drug Administration which is used in the treatment of stroke and coronary heart disease. However, the research on the composition and mechanism of NXT is still lacking. Our research aimed to identify the absorbable components, potential targets, and associated pathways of NXT with network pharmacology method. We explored the chemical compositions of NXT based on UPLC/Q-TOF-MS. Then, we used the five principles of drug absorption to identify absorbable ingredients. The databases of PharmMapper, Universal Protein, and the Molecule Annotation System were used to predict the main targets and related pathways. By the five principles of drug absorption as a judgment rule, we identified 63 compositions that could be absorbed in the blood in all 81 chemical compositions. Based on the constructed networks by the significant regulated 123 targets and 77 pathways, the main components that mediated the efficacy of NXT were organic acids, saponins, and tanshinones. Radix Astragali was the critical herbal medicine in NXT, which contained more active components than other herbs and regulated more targets and pathways. Our results showed that NXT had a therapeutic effect on heart diseases through the pattern "multiple components-multiple targets-multiple pathways."

26590241|t|Using formative research to develop a nutrition education resource aimed at assisting low-income households in South Africa adopt a healthier diet.
26590241|a|As part of a comprehensive programme to prevent non-communicable disease in South Africa, there is a need to develop public education campaigns on healthy eating. Urban populations of lower socioeconomic status are a priority target population. This study involved formative research to guide the development of a nutrition resource appropriate to the budgetary constraints and information needs of poor households in the major urban centres of South Africa. Twenty-two focus groups were convened to explore the target audience's knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and practices as they related to healthy eating and their views about the proposed nutrition resource (N = 167). A brief questionnaire assessed eating and cooking practices among focus group participants. Key informant interviews with eight dieticians/nutritionists working with this population added to the focus group findings. The research identified important issues to take into account in the development of the resource. These included the need to: directly address prevalent misconceptions about healthy eating and unhealthy eating practices; increase self-efficacy regarding the purchasing and preparation of healthy food; represent diverse cultural traditions and consider the issues of affordability and availability of food ingredients. This study demonstrates the value of using formative research in the design of nutrition-related communication in a multicultural, poor, urban South African setting.

25908300|t|Geographic region and racial variations in polypharmacy in the United States.
25908300|a|PURPOSE: Medications can have unintended effects. High medication use populations may benefit from increased regimen oversight. Limited knowledge exists concerning racial and regional polypharmacy variation. We estimated total medication distributions (excluding supplements) of American black and white adults and assessed racial and regional polypharmacy variation. METHODS: REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort data (n = 30,239 U.S. blacks and whites aged ≥45 years) were analyzed. Home pill bottle inspections assessed the last two weeks' medications. Polypharmacy (≥8 medications) was determined by summing prescription and/or over-the-counter ingredients. Population-weighted logistic regression assessed polypharmacy's association with census region, race, and sex. RESULTS: The mean ingredient number was 4.12 (standard error = 0.039), with 15.7% of REGARDS using 8 ingredients or more. In crude comparisons, women used more medications than men, and blacks and whites reported similar mean ingredients. A cross-sectional, logistic model adjusting for demographics, socioeconomics, and comorbidities showed increased polypharmacy prevalence in whites versus blacks (OR [95% CI]: 0.63, [0.55-0.72]), women (1.94 [1.68-2.23]), and Southerners (broadly Southeasterners and Texans; 1.48 [1.17-1.87]) versus Northeasterners (broadly New England and upper Mid-Atlantic). Possible limitations include polypharmacy misclassification and model misspecification. CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy is common. Race and geography are associated with polypharmacy variation. Further study of underlying factors explaining these differences is warranted.

25281824|t|Neuroprotective action of resveratrol.
25281824|a|Low-to-moderate red wine consumption appeared to reduce age-related neurological disorders including macular degeneration, stroke, and cognitive deficits with or without dementia. Resveratrol has been considered as one of the key ingredients responsible for the preventive action of red wine since the stilbene displays a neuroprotective action in various models of toxicity. Besides its well documented free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory properties, resveratrol has been shown to increase the clearance of beta-amyloid, a key feature of Alzheimer's disease, and to modulate intracellular effectors associated with oxidative stress (e.g. heme oxygenase), neuronal energy homeostasis (e.g. AMP kinase), program cell death (i.e. AIF) and longevity (i.e. sirtuins). This article summarizes the most recent findings on mechanisms of action involved in the protective effects of this multi target polyphenol, and discusses its possible roles in the prevention of various age-related neurological disorders. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Resveratrol: Challenges in translating pre-clinical findings to improved patient outcomes.

25677097|t|Neuroprotective activity of (1S,2E,4R,6R,-7E,11E)-2,7,11-cembratriene-4,6-diol (4R) in vitro and in vivo in rodent models of brain ischemia.
25677097|a|(1S,2E,4R,6R,-7E,11E)-2,7,11-cembratriene-4,6-diol (4R) is a precursor to key flavor ingredients in leaves of Nicotiana species. The present study shows 4R decreased brain damage in rodent ischemic stroke models. The 4R-pretreated mice had lower infarct volumes (26.2±9.7 mm3) than those in control groups (untreated: 63.4±4.2 mm3, DMSO: 60.2±14.2 mm3). The 4R-posttreated rats also had less infarct volumes (120±65 mm3) than those in the rats of the DMSO group (291±95 mm3). The results from in vitro experiments indicate that 4R decreased neuro2a cell (neuroblastoma cells) apoptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), and improved the population spikes' (PSs) recovery in rat acute hippocampal slices under OGD; a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, wortmannin, abolished the effect of 4R on PSs recovery. Furthermore, 4R also inhibited monocyte adhesion to murine brain-derived endothelial (bEND5) cells and upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) induced by OGD/reoxygenation (OGD/R), and restored the p-Akt level to pre-OGD/R values in bEND5 cells. In conclusion, the present study indicates that 4R has a protective effect in rodent ischemic stroke models. Inhibition of ICAM-1 expression and restoration of Akt phosphorylation are the possible mechanisms involved in cellular protection by 4R.

25647681|t|Sodium and sugar in complementary infant and toddler foods sold in the United States.
25647681|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sodium and sugar content of US commercial infant and toddler foods. METHODS: We used a 2012 nutrient database of 1074 US infant and toddler foods and drinks developed from a commercial database, manufacturer Web sites, and major grocery stores. Products were categorized on the basis of their main ingredients and the US Food and Drug Administration's reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (RACC). Sodium and sugar contents and presence of added sugars were determined. RESULTS: All but 2 of the 657 infant vegetables, dinners, fruits, dry cereals, and ready-to-serve mixed grains and fruits were low sodium (≤140 mg/RACC). The majority of these foods did not contain added sugars; however, 41 of 79 infant mixed grains and fruits contained ≥1 added sugar, and 35 also contained >35% calories from sugar. Seventy-two percent of 72 toddler dinners were high in sodium content (>210 mg/RACC). Toddler dinners contained an average of 2295 mg of sodium per 1000 kcal (sodium 212 mg/100 g). Savory infant/toddler snacks (n = 34) contained an average of sodium 1382 mg/1000 kcal (sodium 486 mg/100 g); 1 was high sodium. Thirty-two percent of toddler dinners and the majority of toddler cereal bars/breakfast pastries, fruit, and infant/toddler snacks, desserts, and juices contained ≥1 added sugar. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial toddler foods and infant or toddler snacks, desserts, and juice drinks are of potential concern due to sodium or sugar content. Pediatricians should advise parents to look carefully at labels when selecting commercial toddler foods and to limit salty snacks, sweet desserts, and juice drinks.

25343960|t|Considerations in the efficacy and effectiveness of virtual reality interventions for stroke rehabilitation: moving the field forward.
25343960|a|In the past 2 decades, researchers have demonstrated the potential for virtual reality (VR) technologies to provide engaging and motivating environments for stroke rehabilitation interventions. Much of the research has been focused on the exploratory phase, and jumps to intervention efficacy trials and scale-up evaluation have been made with limited understanding of the active ingredients in a VR intervention for stroke. The rapid pace of technology development is an additional challenge for this emerging field, providing a moving target for researchers developing and evaluating potential VR technologies. Recent advances in customized games and cutting-edge technology used for VR are beginning to allow for researchers to understand and control aspects of the intervention related to motivation, engagement, and motor control and learning. This article argues for researchers to take a progressive, step-wise approach through the stages of intervention development using evidence-based principles, take advantage of the data that can be obtained, and utilize measurement tools to design effective VR interventions for stroke rehabilitation that can be assessed through carefully designed efficacy and effectiveness trials. This article is motivated by the recent calls in the field of rehabilitation clinical trials research for carefully structured clinical trials that have progressed through the phases of research.

25679527|t|Comparing different policy scenarios to reduce the consumption of ultra-processed foods in UK: impact on cardiovascular disease mortality using a modelling approach.
25679527|a|BACKGROUND: The global burden of non-communicable diseases partly reflects growing exposure to ultra-processed food products (UPPs). These heavily marketed UPPs are cheap and convenient for consumers and profitable for manufacturers, but contain high levels of salt, fat and sugars. This study aimed to explore the potential mortality reduction associated with future policies for substantially reducing ultra-processed food intake in the UK. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We obtained data from the UK Living Cost and Food Survey and from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey. By the NOVA food typology, all food items were categorized into three groups according to the extent of food processing: Group 1 describes unprocessed/minimally processed foods. Group 2 comprises processed culinary ingredients. Group 3 includes all processed or ultra-processed products. Using UK nutrient conversion tables, we estimated the energy and nutrient profile of each food group. We then used the IMPACT Food Policy model to estimate reductions in cardiovascular mortality from improved nutrient intakes reflecting shifts from processed or ultra-processed to unprocessed/minimally processed foods. We then conducted probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Approximately 175,000 cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths might be expected in 2030 if current mortality patterns persist. However, halving the intake of Group 3 (processed) foods could result in approximately 22,055 fewer CVD related deaths in 2030 (minimum estimate 10,705, maximum estimate 34,625). An ideal scenario in which salt and fat intakes are reduced to the low levels observed in Group 1 and 2 could lead to approximately 14,235 (minimum estimate 6,680, maximum estimate 22,525) fewer coronary deaths and approximately 7,820 (minimum estimate 4,025, maximum estimate 12,100) fewer stroke deaths, comprising almost 13% mortality reduction. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a substantial potential for reducing the cardiovascular disease burden through a healthier food system. It highlights the crucial importance of implementing healthier UK food policies.

24237326|t|Pharmacokinetics and efficiency of brain targeting of ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 given as Nao-Qing microemulsion.
24237326|a|Nao-Qing solution has been shown to be clinically effective in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The purpose of this study was to improve the pharmacokinetics and brain uptake of Nao-Qing, administered as an oil-in-water microemulsion. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were given Nao-Qing microemulsion by intranasal or intragastric routes. Samples of blood, brain, heart, liver, lung and kidney were collected at pre-determined time intervals, and the contents of ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 (active ingredients of the Nao-Qing microemulsion) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that contents of ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 in Nao-Qing microemulsion was 8475.13 ± 54.61 μg/ml and 6633.42 ± 527.27 μg/ml, respectively, and that the particle size, pH and viscosity of the microemulsion were 19.9 ± 5.07 nm, 6.1 and 3.056 × 10(-3 )Pas, respectively. Absorption of ginsenoside Rg1 was higher than that of ginsenoside Rb1, which was barely detectable after intragastric administration; furthermore, the concentration of ginsenoside Rg1 in blood and other tissues at each time point was lower for intragastric than for intranasal administration. Compared with intragastric administration, intranasal administration resulted in a shorter tmax (0.08 versus 1 h), a higher Cmax (16.65 versus 11.29 μg/ml), and a higher area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) (592.91 versus 101.70 μgċh/ml) in the brain. The relative rates of uptake (Re) and the ratio of peak concentration (Ce) in the brain were 126.31% and 147.48% for ginsenoside Rg1, respectively. These data illustrate that intranasal administration can promote the absorption of drugs in Nao-Qing microemulsion and achieve fast effect.

25408503|t|Neuroprotection by saponins.
25408503|a|Saponins, an important group of bioactive plant natural products, are glycosides of triterpenoid or steroidal aglycones. Their diverse biological activities are ascribed to their different structures. Saponins have long been recognized as key ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine. Accumulated evidence suggests that saponins have significant neuroprotective effects on attenuation of central nervous system disorders, such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the observed effects remains incomplete. Based on recently reported data from basic and clinical studies, this review highlights the proposed mechanisms of their neuroprotective function including antioxidant, modulation of neurotransmitters, anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, attenuating Ca(2+) influx, modulating neurotrophic factors, inhibiting tau phosphorylation, and regeneration of neural networks.

25482528|t|Cyclodextrins, blood-brain barrier, and treatment of neurological diseases.
25482528|a|Biological barriers are the main defense systems of the homeostasis of the organism and protected organs. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), formed by the endothelial cells of brain capillaries, not only provides nutrients and protection to the central nervous system but also restricts the entry of drugs, emphasizing its importance in the treatment of neurological diseases. Cyclodextrins are increasingly used in human pharmacotherapy. Due to their favorable profile to form hydrophilic inclusion complexes with poorly soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients, they are present as excipients in many marketed drugs. Application of cyclodextrins is widespread in formulations for oral, parenteral, nasal, pulmonary, and skin delivery of drugs. Experimental and clinical data suggest that cyclodextrins can be used not only as excipients for centrally acting marketed drugs like antiepileptics, but also as active pharmaceutical ingredients to treat neurological diseases. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin received orphan drug designation for the treatment of Niemann-Pick type C disease. In addition to this rare lysosomal storage disease with neurological symptoms, experimental research revealed the potential therapeutic use of cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin nanoparticles in neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, neuroinfections and brain tumors. In this context, the biological effects of cyclodextrins, their interaction with plasma membranes and extraction of different lipids are highly relevant at the level of the BBB.

25175837|t|Anti-oxidative nutrient-rich diet protects against acute ischemic brain damage in rats.
25175837|a|We evaluated the neuroprotective effects of an anti-oxidative nutrient rich enteral diet (AO diet) that contained rich polyphenols (catechins and proanthocyanidins) and many other anti-oxidative ingredients. Wistar rats were treated with either vehicle, normal AO diet (containing 100kcal/100mL, catechin 38.75mg/100mL and proanthocyanidin 19mg/100mL, 1mL/day), or high AO diet (containing 10 times the polyphenols of the normal AO diet) for 14 days, and were subjected to 90min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The AO diet improved motor function, reduced cerebral infarction volume, and decreased both peroxidative markers such as 4-hydroxynonenal, advanced glycation end products, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and inflammatory markers such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Our study has shown that an AO diet has neuroprotective effects through both anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, indicating that nutritional control with polyphenols could be useful for patients with acute ischemic stroke.

25237385|t|Amygdalin isolated from Semen Persicae (Tao Ren) extracts induces the expression of follistatin in HepG2 and C2C12 cell lines.
25237385|a|BACKGROUND: The Chinese medicine formulation ISF-1 (also known as Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu-Tang) for post-stroke rehabilitation could increase the expression of growth-regulating protein follistatin by approximately 4-fold. This study aims to identify the active compounds of ISF-1 for the induction of follistatin expression. METHODS: Active compounds in ISF-1 responsible for induction of follistatin were identified by a bioactivity-guided fractionation procedure involving liquid-liquid extraction, HPLC separation and RT-PCR detection. The aqueous extracts of seven ISF-1 ingredients including Semen Persicae (Tao Ren) and the S. Persicae-derived fractions were assayed for the induction of follistatin mRNA expression in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells by RT-PCR. The concentrations of isolated compounds were proportionally normalized to the reported IC50 concentration (5.8 mg/mL) of the formulation ISF-1 in HepG2. The active fractions were characterized by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column and identified by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Three ingredients of ISF-1, namely S. Persicae (Tao Ren), Pheretima (Di Long), and Flos Carthami (Hong Hua), induced the expression of follistatin mRNA. Among these, the ingredient S. Persicae were the most active, and amygdalin from S. Persicae extract was identified as a novel follistatin inducer. Amygdalin stimulated the growth of skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Amygdalin isolated from S. Persicae extract in ISF-1 through a bioactivity-guided fractionation procedure induced the expression of follistatin in HepG2 and C2C12 cell lines.

24792734|t|Ginsenoside Rd attenuates tau protein phosphorylation via the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway after transient forebrain ischemia.
24792734|a|Phosphorylated tau was found to be regulated after cerebral ischemia and linked to high risk for the development of post-stroke dementia. Our previous study showed that ginsenoside Rd (Rd), one of the main active ingredients in Panax ginseng, decreased tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer model. As an extending study, here we investigated whether Rd could reduce tau phosphorylation and sequential cognition impairment after ischemic stroke. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to focal cerebral ischemia. The tau phosphorylation of rat brains were analyzed following ischemia by Western blot and animal cognitive functions were examined by Morris water maze and Novel object recognition task. Ischemic insults increased the levels of phosphorylated tau protein at Ser199/202 and PHF-1 sites and caused animal memory deficits. Rd treatment attenuated ischemia-induced enhancement of tau phosphorylation and ameliorated behavior impairment. Furthermore, we revealed that Rd inhibited the activity of Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), the most important kinase involving tau phosphorylation, but enhanced the activity of protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), a key kinase suppressing GSK-3β activity. Moreover, we found that LY294002, an antagonist for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway, abolished the inhibitory effect of Rd on GSK-3β activity and tau phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence that Rd may reduce cerebral ischemia-induced tau phosphorylation via the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway.

25172450|t|Establishment of the method for screening the potential targets and effective components of huatuo reconstruction pill.
25172450|a|Huatuo reconstruction pill (HTRP) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that mainly treats for hemiplegia and postoperation of brain stroke. Existing pharmacological studies have previously shown that HTRP could inhibit in vitro thrombosis, delay platelet adhesion, dilate blood vessels, and improve the microcirculation disturbances. In this paper, we chiefly concerned about the potential targets of HTRP and tried to figure out the active components of it. Computer-aided drug design method was emploied to search for the active components and explain the mechanism between the targets and the small molecules at molecular lever. The potential targets of this compound pharmaceutics were searched through relevant pharmacological studies and three pharmacophore models which involved the platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT2A) were constructed by Discotech method of Sybyl. Thus, the candidate compounds which agreed with the pharmacophore models were obtained by the virtual screening to the known ingredients of HTRP. Based on that, sequence and structure prediction of the unknown targets were realized by homology modeling which were used for molecular docking with those candidate compounds. Results showed that three compounds, which may prove to be valid to these targets, got higher scores than the existing corresponding inhibitors after molecular docking, including ferulic acid, onjixanthone I and albiflorin. And the three molecules may refer to the singificant substances to the total compounds of HTRP which were effective to the disease.

24562591|t|Herbal medicines for ischemic stroke: combating inflammation as therapeutic targets.
24562591|a|Stroke is a debilitating disease for which limited therapeutic approaches are available currently. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing novel therapies for stroke. Astrocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes constitute a neurovascular network for metabolic requirement of neurons. During ischemic stroke, these cells contribute to post-ischemic inflammation at multiple stages of ischemic cascades. Upon ischemia onset, activated resident microglia and astrocytes, and infiltrated immune cells release multiple inflammation factors including cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, free radicals and other small molecules, not only inducing brain damage but affecting brain repair. Recent progress indicates that anti-inflammation is an important therapeutic strategy for stroke. Given a long history with direct experience in the treatment of human subjects, Traditional Chinese Medicine and its related natural compounds are recognized as important sources for drug discovery. Last decade, a great progress has been made to identify active compounds from herbal medicines with the properties of modulating post-ischemic inflammation for neuroprotection. Herein, we discuss the inflammatory pathway in early stage and secondary response to injured tissues after stroke from initial artery occlusion to brain repair, and review the active ingredients from natural products with anti-inflammation and neuroprotection effects as therapeutic agents for ischemic stroke. Further studies on the post-ischemic inflammatory mechanisms and corresponding drug candidates from herbal medicine may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies in stroke treatment.

24719562|t|Amelioration of stroke-induced neurological deficiency by lyophilized powder of catapol and puerarin.
24719562|a|Catalpol and puerarin are active ingredients isolated from Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch and Radix Puerariae, respectively. They are popular in research for their poly-pharmacological effects. This research focused on effect of anti-stroke by lyophilized powder of catalpol and puerarin (C-P) and potential mechanisms. At the beginning of research, C-P was identified and analyzed by HPLC. Neurological function was evaluated by Longa score, neurological complex function score and beam balance score after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAO) in mice. Infarct volume and water content were evaluated after treatment of C-P. Anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis and neurogenesis were investigated by ELISA, WB and immunohistochemical stain respectively. With treatment of C-P, neurological deficiency of PMCAO mice was ameliorated. Morphologically, infarct volume and water content in ischemic hemisphere were significantly reduced by C-P. In vivo and in vitro, oxidative stress injury was extenuated by C-P. Meanwhile, Caspase-3 was down-regulated and Bxl-2 was up-regulated by C-P in vivo. In addition, C-P enhanced angiogenesis around the infarct of cortex and neurogenesis in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus (DG). Hence, C-P ameliorated stroke-induced neurological deficiency through its multiple neuroprotections. What's more, this article provides us a novel formula of active ingredients for stroke.

24412553|t|The effect of stroke and other components in Xing-Nao-Jing on the pharmacokinetics of geniposide.
24412553|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Geniposide is a bioactive substance derived from gardenia, which has been used in traditional Chinese preparation, such as "Xing-Nao-Jing" (XNJ) for stroke treatment. Stroke and the ingredients of herbal preparation affect the pharmacokinetics of geniposide. A comparative pharmacokinetic study of geniposide in stroke and sham-operated rats after administration of XNJ and geniposide was proceeded to evaluate the effect of stroke on pharmacokinetics of geniposide, while the influence of other components in XNJ was determined by using gardenia extract and geniposide-borneol compounds in rats with stroke to compare. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion 2h later. Plasma concentration of geniposide was determined by HPLC. Various pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from the plasma concentration versus time data using non-compartmental methods. RESULTS: The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC0-t) in stroke after administration of XNJ were 5.97±3.82 μg/mL, and 570.06±274.32 μg·min/mL, respectively, which were 5 times compared with sham-operated rats or the stroke-afflicted rats given geniposide. In stroke, the Cmax and AUC(0-t) of geniposide-borneol group and gardenia extraction group were close to XNJ group and geniposide group, respectively. The geniposide-borneol group had a higher value. CONCLUSION: Stroke improved the absorption of geniposide in XNJ. Borneol may be the key ingredient in XNJ improving the absorption of geniposide.

24516788|t|Statistical optimization of fibrinolytic enzyme production by Pseudoalteromonas sp. IND11 using cow dung substrate by response surface methodology.
24516788|a|Fibrinolytic enzymes are agents that dissolve fibrin clots. These fibrinolytic agents have potential use to treat cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke. In the present article, a fibrinolytic enzyme producing Pseudoalteromonas sp. IND11 was isolated from the fish scales and optimized for enzyme production. Cow dung was used as a substrate for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme in solid-state culture. A two-level full factorial design was used for the screening of key ingredients while further optimization was carried out using the central composite design. Statistical analysis revealed that the second-order model is significant with model F-value of 6.88 and R (2) value of 0.860. Enzyme production was found to be high at pH 7.0, and the supplementation of 1% (w/w) maltose and 0.1% (w/w) sodium dihydrogen phosphate enhanced fibrinolytic enzyme production. The optimization of process parameters using response surface methodology resulted in a three-fold increase in the yield of fibrinolytic enzyme. This is the first report on production of fibrinolytic enzyme using cow dung substrate in solid-state fermentation.

23823619|t|The Mediterranean diet in relation to mortality and CVD: a Danish cohort study.
23823619|a|The aim of the present study was to determine whether the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) is associated with reduced total mortality, cardiovascular incidence and mortality in a Danish population. Analyses were performed on 1849 men and women sampled during the 1982-83 Danish MONICA (MONItoring trends and determinants of Cardiovascular disease) population study, whose diet was assessed by means of a validated 7 d food record. The adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was calculated by three different scores: one based on a classification excluding ingredients from mixed dishes and recipes (score 1); another based on a classification including ingredients (score 2); the last one based on a variant of the latter including wine instead of alcohol intake (score 3). The association between these scores and, respectively, total mortality, cardiovascular incidence and mortality was tested by a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for several potential confounders of the association. Generally, all three scores were inversely associated with the endpoints, although associations with score 1 did not reach statistical significance. Score 2 was inversely associated with total mortality (hazard ratio 0·94; 95 % CI 0·88, 0·99). This association was confirmed for total cardiovascular as well as myocardial infarction (MI) incidence and mortality, but not for stroke. Score 3 was slightly more associated with the same outcomes. All associations were also resistant to adjustment for covariates related to potential CVD pathways, such as blood lipids, blood pressure and weight change after 11 years of follow-up. In a Danish cohort, the MDS was inversely associated with total mortality and with cardiovascular and MI incidence and mortality, but not with stroke incidence or mortality.

25227546|t|A virtual reality system integrated with robot-assisted haptics to simulate pinch-grip task: Motor ingredients for the assessment in chronic stroke.
25227546|a|BACKGROUND: Among numerous studies on virtual reality (VR) technology for motor rehabilitation, the majorities have only used it as a motor training system and did not use the kinematic or kinetic information obtained as the basis for therapeutic effect assessment. OBJECTIVE: Incorporating the kinematic and kinetic information acquired through a robot-assisted VR system on pinch-grip training, this study intends to propose novel motor ingredients represented as indices for the interpretation of motor behaviors and verify the efficacy of them for the assessment in chronic stroke. METHODS: Clinical trials were conducted on eight stroke patients and clinical assessments were made as the objective standard. Non-parametric test and correlation analysis were performed on results of motor indices and clinical assessments. RESULTS: Non-parametric test indicated that 50% of the motor indices significantly improved while the others showed a trend of improvement, consisting with the findings in clinical assessments. Correlation analysis showed that the three clinical assessment items were correlated to items in the motor ingredients. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed motor ingredients gathered from the robot-assisted VR training system were able to contribute to the assessment of therapeutic effect in chronic stroke and were capable for the interpretation of behavior phases.

24376419|t|Ginsenoside Rd promotes glutamate clearance by up-regulating glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 via PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathways.
24376419|a|Ginsenoside Rd (Rd), one of the main active ingredients in Panax ginseng, has been showed to protect against ischemic cerebral damage both in vitro and in vivo. However, the underlying mechanism of Rd is largely unknown. Excessive extracellular glutamate causes excitatory toxicity, leading to cell death, and neurodegenerative processes after brain ischemia. The clearance of extracellular glutamate by astrocytic glutamate transporter GLT-1 is essential for neuronal survival after stroke. Here we investigated the effects of Rd on the levels of extracellular glutamate and the expression of GLT-1 in vivo and in vitro. After rat middle cerebral artery occlusion, Rd significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of GLT-1, and reduced the burst of glutamate as revealed by microdialysis. Consistently, specific glutamate uptake by cultured astrocytes was elevated after Rd exposure. Furthermore, we showed that Rd increased the levels of phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in astrocyte culture after oxygen-glucose deprivation. Moreover, the effect of Rd on GLT-1 expression and glutamate uptake can be abolished by PI3K/AKT agonist LY294002 or ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence that Rd can promote glutamate clearance by up-regulating GLT-1 expression through PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathways.

24036516|t|Identification of multiple ingredients for a Traditional Chinese Medicine preparation (bu-yang-huan-wu-tang) by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.
24036516|a|Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang (BYHWT) is a popular Traditional Chinese Medicine formula consisting of seven herbal medicines (Astragalus membranaceus, Angelica sinensis, Paeonia lactiflora, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Carthamus tinctorius, Amygdalus persica and Pheretima aspergillum), that has been used in China for centuries to overcome stroke-induced disability. To ensure the consistency of quality, a reliable analytical method is required, therefore, we developed a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for quantitative analysis of the major constituents in BYHWT. The herbal ingredients consisting of the cycloartane-type triterpene glycosides of astragaloside I, astragaloside II and astragaloside IV; isoflavones of formononetin, ononin calycosin, calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside; ligustilide and paeoniflorin were separated on a C18 column with gradient elution of methanol/10 mM ammonium acetate buffer-formic acid (100:0.1, v/v). This study was performed by a mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization (ESI) with positive ionization ions monitored in the multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. The linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were validated for this quantification method, and the sensitivity, reliability and reproducibility were all confirmed. The experiments provided a good method for analyzing BYHWT extracts. This study also quantitated the active components in various brands of commercially available products. The results indicated that the pharmaceutical industrial products of BYHWT exhibited considerable variation in their contents of the herbal compounds.

23628154|t|Novel pharmacokinetic studies of the Chinese formula Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang in MCAO rats.
23628154|a|Our previous studies showed that after oral administration of an Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT) decoction, there is a higher concentration of the pure components, berberine, baicalin and gardenoside in the plasma of Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats than in sham-operated rats, The aim of the present study was to determine whether these components could be reliably measured in MCAO rat tissues. First, the plasma concentration-time profiles of berberine, palmatine, baicalin, baicalein and gardenoside were characterised in MCAO rats after oral administration of the aqueous extract of HLJDT. Subsequently, liver, lung and kidney tissues were obtained from sudden death MCAO rats in the absorption phase (0.25 h), the distribution phase (1.0 h) and the elimination phase (8.0 h) after administration of the HLJDT aqueous extract. An HPLC method was developed and validated for the determination of the distribution characteristics of berberine, palmatine, baicalin, baicalein and gardenoside simultaneously from the above-mentioned rat tissues. The results indicated that berberine, palmatine, baicalin and baicalein distributed rapidly and accumulated at high levels in the lung, while gardenoside distributed widely in the lung and the kidney. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the distribution of the active ingredients derived from HLJDT in MCAO rat tissues. The tissue distribution results provide a biopharmaceutical basis for the design of the clinic application of HLJDT in cerebrovascular disease.

23707212|t|The protective role of Tongxinluo on blood-brain barrier after ischemia-reperfusion brain injury.
23707212|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tongxinluo (TXL), a renowned traditional Chinese medicine, consists of several different kinds of ingredients and has been widely used to treat myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. However, the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms are not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: We focus on the effect of TXL on blood-brain barrier (BBB) including edema formation and tight junction (TJ) protein rearrangement, and inflammatory response after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). We further explore the protective mechanism of TXL on ischemia-induced BBB damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult CD1 male mice (n=168) were randomly divided into TXL pre-treatment group, TXL pre-post treatment group, TXL post-treatment group, control group and sham group. Mice in TXL pre-treatment group were given TXL solution by 1g/kg/day orally for 7 days before tMCAO. Mice in pre-post treatment group were continuously given TXL 7 days before and 14 days after tMCAO. Mice in TXL post-treatment group were given TXL solution immediately after tMCAO. Rotarod test and neurological severity scores were evaluated at 1-14 days following tMCAO. Brains were harvested for examining infarct volume, edema formation, and immunofluorescent staining at 1 and 3 days after tMCAO. Cytokines IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA expression, and BBB permeability were further examined by RT-PCR and immunostaining. RESULTS: TXL pre-post treatment improved neurobehavioral outcomes and reduced infarct volume compared to the control (p<0.05). Meanwhile, hemispheric swelling, Evans blue and IgG protein extravasation reduced, while TJ protein expression up-regulated in pre-post treatment group (p<0.05). Further study indicated that infarct volume was smaller and BBB damage was less severe in TXL pre-post treatment group compared to TXL pre-treatment alone. It was noted that fewer myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive cells and less cytokines IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α expression in pre-post treatment group compared to the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: TXL pre-treatment and pre-post treatment effectively protected the brain from BBB disruption via alleviating inflammatory response. Moreover, pre-post treatment has better outcomes, suggesting that continuous administration of TXL before and throughout ischemia period is necessary because of multiple functions of TXL.

23619720|t|Xanthotoxol exerts neuroprotective effects via suppression of the inflammatory response in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.
23619720|a|We previously found that xanthotoxol, one of the major active ingredients in Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson, exerts protective effects in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by alleviating brain edema, inhibiting the neutrophil infiltration, and decreasing the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin. The present study was designed to further determine the possible mechanisms of action of neuroprotective properties of xanthotoxol after cerebral ischemia. Transient focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model in male Sprague-Dawley rats was induced by 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 24-h reperfusion. Xanthotoxol (5 and 10 mg/kg) or vehicle were administered intraperitoneally at 1 and 12 h after the onset of ischemia. At 24 h after reperfusion, we assessed the effect of xanthotoxol on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-8, nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and the p65 subunit of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the cortex after ischemic insult. The results showed that xanthotoxol treatment significantly attenuated BBB disruption, reduced the IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-8 and NO level, and attenuated the iNOS activity compared with vehicle-treated animals. Further, xanthotoxol treatment also significantly prevented the ischemia/reperfusion-induced increase in the protein expression of iNOS, COX-2, and the nuclear NF-κB p65. These results, taken together with those of our previous study, suggest that the neuroprotection may be attributed to the ability of xanthotoxol to attenuate the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and thereby inhibit the inflammatory response after cerebral ischemia.

23501173|t|Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation--an Asian stroke perspective.
23501173|a|Despite relatively lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in Asians (~1%) than in Caucasians (~2%), Asia has a much higher overall disease burden because of its proportionally larger aged population. For example, on the basis of reported age-adjusted prevalence rates and projected population figures in China, there will be an estimated 5.2 million men and 3.1 million women with AF older than 60 years by year 2050. Stroke is a disabling complication of AF that is of increasing cause for concern in Asians patients. Implementing consensus expert recommendations for managing stroke risk in patients with AF can considerably reduce stroke rates. However, caution is necessary when aligning management of Asian patients with AF to that of their Caucasian counterparts. Current international guidelines and risk stratification tools for AF management are based on findings in predominantly Caucasian populations and may therefore have limited relevance, in certain respects, to Asian patients. Oral anticoagulants play an important role in preventing AF-related stroke. The vitamin K antagonist warfarin is recommended for reducing the risk of stroke and thromboembolism in high-risk patients with nonvalvular AF; however, warfarin interacts with many drugs and food ingredients, which may pose significant challenges in administration and monitoring among Asian patients. Further research is needed to inform specific guidance on the implications of different stroke and bleeding profiles in Asians vs Caucasians. Moreover, there is scope to improve physician perceptions and patient knowledge, as well as considering alternative new oral anticoagulants, for example, direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors.

23805113|t|Handwriting measures as reflectors of executive functions among adults with Developmental Coordination Disorders (DCD).
23805113|a|Planning ahead and organizational abilities in time and space are ingredients of high-level cognitive functions labeled as 'Executive Functions' (EF) required for daily activities such as writing or home management. EF deficits are considered a possible underlying brain mechanism involved in Developmental Coordination Disorders (DCD).THE AIM: of the study was to compare the handwriting process measures and the planning and organizational abilities in space and time of students with DCD with those of matched controls and to find whether handwriting measures can predict daily planning and organizational abilities among students with DCD. METHOD: 30 students diagnosed with DCD, between the ages of 24-41, and 30 age- and gender-matched controls participated in the study. They filled out the Handwriting Proficiency Screening Questionnaire (HPSQ) and the Adult Developmental Co-ordination Disorders Checklist (ADC). Furthermore, they copied a paragraph on a digitizer that is part of a computerized system Computerised Penmanship Evaluation Toll (ComPET). RESULTS: Significant group differences were found for the HPSQ subscales scores as well as for the temporal and spatial measures of the paragraph copy task. Significant group differences were also found for the planning and organizational abilities in space and time as reflected through the ADC subscales. Significant medium correlations were found in both groups between the mean HPSQ time subscale and the ADC-B subscale mean score (r = 0.50/0.58, p < 0.05). Series of regression analyses indicated that two handwriting performance measures (mean HPSQ time subscale and mean stroke duration) predicted 19% of planning and organizational abilities as reflected through daily functions (ADC-B) [F (3, 54) = 38.37, β = 0.40, p < 0.0001]. CONCLUSION: The results support previous evidence about EF deficits as an underlying brain mechanism involved in motor coordination disorders, their significance as related to theoretical models of handwriting and daily function among DCD will be examined.

31380522|t|Patient-Specific Modeling of Heart Valves: From Image to Simulation.
31380522|a|Heart valves play a very important role in the functioning of the heart and many of the heart failures are related to the valvular dysfunctions, e.g. aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. As the medical field is moving towards a patient-specific diagnosis and treatment procedures, modeling of heart valves with patient-specific information is becoming a significant tool in medical field. Here we present the ingredients for valve simulation specifically the aortic valve, with a main focus on a novel spline-based mapping technique which solves many issues in generating patient-specific models - the microstructural mapping, the pre-strain calculations, prescribing dynamic boundary conditions, validation and inverse-modeling to obtain material parameters.

23709150|t|'Legal high' associated Wallenberg syndrome.
23709150|a|'Legal highs' are substances of synthetic or natural origin having psychotropic properties. 'Legal highs' are often new and, in many cases, the actual chemical ingredients in a branded product can be changed without notifications and the risks are unpredictable. Acute recreational drug toxicity is a common reason for presentation to both hospital and prehospital medical services. It appears that, generally, the pattern of toxicity associated with 'legal highs' is broadly similar to that seen with classical stimulant recreational drugs such as cocaine, MDMA (3,4 methylenedioxy-N-methyl amphetamine) and amphetamine. Lack of clear literature pertaining to their chemical properties, pharmacology and toxicology makes an evaluation of their effects difficult. We describe a unique case in which consumption of such a substance led to hospital admission and a diagnosis of 'lateral medullary stroke' or 'Wallenberg syndrome'. We believe that this is the first described case of a 'legal high' intake linked to a posterior circulation stroke.

23254556|t|Promoting neuroplasticity and recovery after stroke: future directions for rehabilitation clinical trials.
23254556|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose is to establish a theoretical framework by which new interventions for poststroke rehabilitation may be developed incorporating knowledge of neuroplasticity and the critical ingredients of rehabilitation. RECENT FINDINGS: Large phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are rare in neurorehabilitation, and the results of those that have been completed are perplexing because the experimental and control treatments were not different when matched for activity level. In addition, the outcome measures used to define treatment effects reflected behavioral endpoints, but did not reveal how neuroplastic mechanisms or other mechanistic factors may have contributed to the treatment response. Knowledge of both the neurophysiologic basis of recovery and key elements of interventions that drive motor learning, such as intensity and task progression, are critical for optimizing future poststroke motor rehabilitation clinical trials. SUMMARY: Future neurorehabilitation RCTs require a better understanding of the interaction of interventions and neurophysiological recovery in order to target interventions at specific neurophysiologic substrates, develop a more clear understanding of the impact of intervention parameters (e.g. dose, intensity), and advance discussions regarding optimal ways to partner medical and rehabilitation interventions in order to improve outcomes.

23396369|t|What are the "ingredients" of modified constraint-induced therapy? An evidence-based review, recipe, and recommendations.
23396369|a|Modified constraint induced movement therapy (mCIT) increases paretic upper extremity use and movement in all phases of stroke. Although fundamental to its appropriate implementation, specific details on day to day implementation on this promising family of therapies have not heretofore been published. Consequently, some integral behavioral facets of mCIT may be overlooked, while other approaches may be easily mistaken to constitute mCIT, during attempts to implement the therapy. The purpose of this paper is to review mCIT, and to provide the clinician-reader with a detailed description of the "ingredients" of mCIT and their rationale, including clinical examples of these components. It is expected that a more complete understanding of the components comprising this promising approach will overcome knowledge barriers associated with its appropriate use, and encourage better patient management in clinical practice.

23397687|t|Hemorrhagic stroke in young healthy male following use of sports supplement Jack3d.
23397687|a|A 26-year-old male was presented to a military treatment facility in Afghanistan shortly after taking a weight-lifting supplement called Jack3d with a severe headache and was subsequently found to have suffered a Dejerine-Roussy variant right thalamic hemorrhagic stroke. Jack3d active ingredients include geranamine, schizandrol A, caffeine, beta-alanine, creatine monohydrate, and L-arginine alpha-ketoglutarate. A literature search revealed case reports suggesting some of the constituent ingredients may predispose to stroke and hemorrhage and also revealed a substantial paucity of data existed regarding schizandrol A, a herb used in traditional eastern medicine. The product has no readily apparent disclaimer or warning regarding the risks or lack of data regarding the components. Jack3d is sold as a nutritional supplement and is therefore not subject to same FDA regulation and scrutiny that a pharmaceutical receives. The potential adverse effect was reported to the FDA via MedWatch in accordance with the recently passed Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act.

23080043|t|New horizons for robot-assisted therapy in pediatrics.
23080043|a|The field of rehabilitation robotics has grown substantially during the past 15 yrs. Studies of upper limb robot-assisted therapy for adults with moderate to severe hemiparesis after stroke have shown significant gains compared with usual care in isolated control, coordination, and strength in the paretic arm (J Rehabil Res Dev 2006;43:171-84; Top Stroke Rehabil 2007;14:22-44; Neurorehabil Neural Repair 2008;22:111-21). While attempts to increase the understanding of the key active ingredients of these interventions continue, researchers have recently extended their focus to children with neurologically based movement disorders arising from cerebral palsy and acquired brain injury or stroke. This study's aim was to provide a narrative review that highlights recent pediatric studies of robot-assisted therapies for the upper and lower limbs. Potential benefits will be discussed, as well as challenges and needs for future development.

24082627|t|In vivo pharmacokinetic comparisons of ferulic acid and puerarin after oral administration of monomer, medicinal substance aqueous extract and Nao-De-Sheng to rats.
24082627|a|BACKGROUND: Nao-De-Sheng decoction (NDS), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription containing Radix puerariae lobatae, Floscarthami, Radix et Rhizoma Notoginseng, Rhizoma chuanxiong and Fructus crataegi, is effective in the treatment of cerebral arteriosclerosis, ischemic cerebral stroke and apoplexy linger effect. Ferulic acid and puerarin are the main absorbed effective ingredients of NDS. OBJECTIVE: To assess the affection of other components in medical material and compound recipe compatibility on the pharmacokinetics of ferulaic acid and puerarin, of ferulic acid from the monomer Rhizoma chuanxiong aqueous extract and NDS were studied. And pharmacokinetics comparisons of puerarin from the monomer Radix puerariae extract and NDS decoction were investigated simultaneously. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At respective different time points after oral administration of the monomer, medicinal substance aqueous extract and NDS at the same dose in rats, plasma concentrations of ferulic acid and puerarin in rats were determined by RP-HPLC, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated with 3P97 software. RESULTS: The plasma concentration-time curves of ferulaic acid and puerarin were both best fitted with a two-compartment model. AUC0-t , AUC0→∞, T max, and C max of ferulic acid in the monomer and NDS decoction were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with that in Rhizoma chuanxiong aqueous extract. And statistically signiﬁcant increase (P < 0.05) in pharmacokinetic parameters of puerarin including AUC0-t , AUC0→∞, CL, T max and C max were obtained after oral administration of puerarin monomer compared with Radix puerariae extract. Although the changes of AUC0-t , AUC0→∞ and CL had no statistically significant, C max of puerarin in NDS was increased remarkably (P < 0.05) compared with that in single puerarin. CONCLUSIONS: Some ingredients of Rhizoma chuanxiong and Radix puerariae may be suggested to remarkably influence plasma concentrations of ferulaic acid and puerarin. Some ingredients in NDS may increase dissolution and absorption of ferulaic acid and puerarin, delay elimination, and subsequently enhance bioavailability of ferulaic acid and puerarin in rats after compatibility.

22925661|t|Neuroprotective effect of 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg(3) against transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
22925661|a|Gensenosides, the active ingredients of Chinese herbal medicine Panax ginseng, have a wide spectrum of medical effects, such as anti-tumorigenic, angiosuppressive, adaptogenic, and anti-fatigue activities. In the present study, we have investigated the neuroprotective effect of 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg(3) (20(R)-Rg(3)) against transient focal cerebral ischemia in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The middle cerebral artery was occluded for 2h in rats and then reperfused for 24h. The behavioral disturbance was evaluated according to neurological deficit scores, and the infarct volumes were evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining; in addition, ischemia-mediated apoptosis was examined using the method of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated d-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The expressions of calpain I and caspase-3 mRNA in hippocampal CA1 region were further assayed using in situ hybridization, in order to clarify the neuroprotective mechanism of 20(R)-Rg(3). 20(R)-Rg(3) at the doses of 10 and 20mgkg(-1) i.p., but not 5mgkg(-1), showed significant neuroprotective effect in rats against focal cerebral ischemic injury by markedly reducing cerebral infarct volumes and degrading infarct rate of TTC-stained coronal brain sections, and improving behavior of the animals. Our results also suggested that 20(R)-Rg(3) (10 and 20mgkg(-1)) could significantly suppress the expressions of calpain I and caspase-3 mRNA. These results indicated that 20(R)-Rg(3) attenuates the neuronal apoptosis caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and its neuprotective effect may be involved in the downregulation of calpain I and caspase-3.

22490611|t|Neuroprotection by the soy isoflavone, genistein, via inhibition of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathways and reactive oxygen induced-NF-κB activation in a cerebral ischemia mouse model.
22490611|a|Recently, the treatment of stroke has focused on antioxidant therapies, where oxidative stress is implicated. The preventive and therapeutic potential of plant compounds on ischemic stroke has been intensively studied because many of them contain antioxidant properties. Genistein, one of the active ingredients in soybean, possesses many bioactivities. In this study, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of genistein and its possible mechanism of action in a cerebral ischemia mouse model. Mice were pretreated with genistein (2.5, 5, and 10mg/kg) or vehicle orally once daily for 14 consecutive days before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed. Genistein at doses of 2.5-10mg/kg significantly reduced the infarct volume, improved the neurological deficit and prevented cell apoptosis after ischemia. In addition, genistein pretreatment was shown to inhibit the ischemia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, enhance the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and decrease levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in stroke mice. Moreover, genistein reversed the mitochondria dysfunction after ischemia, as evidenced by decreasing mitochondria ROS levels, preventing cytochrome C release to the cytoplasm and inhibiting caspase-3 activation. Western blotting showed ischemia activated the ROS-dependent nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, and genistein suppressed phosphorylation and activation of the NF-κB p65 subunit, as well as the phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor protein of κBα (IκBα). Our findings suggested that genistein has a neuroprotective effect in transient focal ischemia, which may involve regulation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathways and suppression of ROS-induced NF-κB activation.

22293345|t|Neuroprotective capabilities of Tanshinone IIA against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via anti-apoptotic pathway in rats.
22293345|a|Danshen, derived from the dried root or rhizome of Salviae miltiorrhizae BGE., has Tanshinone IIA (TSA) as one of its active ingredients. Recent reports have shown that TSA can inhibit the apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal or ethanol in cultured PC12 cells. However, whether TSA has any neuroprotective effect remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of TSA on cerebral apoptosis induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in which cerebral ischemia had been induced 2 h earlier. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the rats were assessed for infarct volume etc. Intraperitoneal administration of 25 and 40 mg/kg TSA 10 min after MCAO significantly diminished infarct volume and brain water content and improved neurological deficits in a dose-dependent manner. The 25 mg/kg dosage was more effective. Treatment with 25 mg/kg TSA significantly improved symptoms and reduce infarct volume at different points in time, of which 10 min after MCAO was the most significant. Nissl-staining and HE-staining of the 25 mg/kg TSA group were more appreciable in terms of improvement relative to the vehicle group in the infarct core. TSA of dosage 25 mg/kg significantly decreased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 protein and increased the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) protein in the ischemic cortex. Fewer terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were found in the penumbra of the treated group, but they were significantly more common in the vehicle group. We here conclude that the neuroprotective effects of TSA against focal cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury are likely to be related to the attenuation of apoptosis.

21811848|t|Ginsenoside Rd protects neurons against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity by inhibiting ca(2+) influx.
21811848|a|Our previous studies have demonstrated that ginsenoside Rd (GSRd), one of the principal ingredients of Pana notoginseng, has neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke. However, the possible mechanism(s) underlying the neuroprotection of GSRd is/are still largely unknown. In this study, we treated glutamate-injured cultured rat hippocampal neurons with different concentrations of GSRd, and then examined the changes in neuronal apoptosis and intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration. Our MTT assay showed that GSRd significantly increased the survival of neurons injured by glutamate in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, TUNEL and Caspase-3 staining showed that GSRd attenuated glutamate-induced cell death. Furthermore, calcium imaging assay revealed that GSRd significantly attenuated the glutamate-induced increase of intracellular free Ca(2+) and also inhibited NMDA-triggered Ca(2+) influx. Thus, the present study demonstrates that GSRd protects the cultured hippocampal neurons against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and that this neuroprotective effect may result from the inhibitory effects of GSRd on Ca(2+) influx.

23227097|a|In seeking the functionality of foodstuff applicable to medicine, ripe tomato fruits were found to show an antiplatelet activity. Therefore, the bioactive compound was isolated, structurally identified, and studied for an inhibitory effects on platelet adhesion, secretion, and aggregation. The concentration of adenosine in ripe tomato fruits (pulp and skin extracts) and its processing by-products (paste and pomace) was determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). According to platelet aggregation inhibition induced by ADP, the total extract residual was fractionated by liquid-liquid separation, obtaining aqueous, ethyl acetate and petroleum ether extracts. The aqueous extract was subjected to repeated permeation over sephadex LH-20 and semipreparative TLC. The isolate finally obtained was identified as adenosine on the basis of ESI-MS, (1)H NMR, HPLC, and UV spectra. Adenosine concentration dependently (2.3-457 μM) platelet aggregation inhibited induced by ADP. Also, adenosine present inhibition of platelet secretion and thrombus formation under flow conditions. The quantitative HPLC analysis revealed significant amounts of adenosine in ripe tomato fruits and its processing by-products. From these results, extracts/fractions of ripe tomato fruits and their processing by-products may be referred to as functional food and functional ingredients containing a compound that inhibits platelet function with a potent preventive effect on thrombus formation, as those that occur in stroke.

23049867|t|Synergism and rules from combination of Baicalin, Jasminoidin and Desoxycholic acid in refined Qing Kai Ling for treat ischemic stroke mice model.
23049867|a|Refined Qing-Kai-Ling (QKL), a modified Chinese medicine, consists of three main ingredients (Baicalin, Jasminoidin and Desoxycholic acid), plays a synergistic effect on the treatment of the acute stage of ischemic stroke. However, the rules of the combination and synergism are still unknown. Based on the ischemic stroke mice model, all different kinds of combination of Baicalin, Jasminoidin, and Desoxycholic acid were investigated by the methods of neurological examination, microarray, and genomics analysis. As a result, it confirmed that the combination of three drugs offered a better therapeutical effect on ischemic stroke than monotherapy of each drug. Additionally, we used Ingenuity pathway Analysis (IPA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the dominant information of expression changes in 373 ischemia-related genes. The results suggested that 5 principal components (PC1-5) could account for more than 95% energy in the gene data. Moreover, 3 clusters (PC1, PC2+PC5, and PC3+PC4) were addressed with cluster analysis. Furthermore, we matched PCs on the drug-target networks, the findings demonstrated that Baicalin related with PC1 that played the leading role in the combination; Jasminoidin related with PC2+PC5 that played a compensatory role; while Desoxycholic acid had the least performance alone which could relate with PC3+PC4 that played a compatible role. These manifestations were accorded with the principle of herbal formulae of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), emperor-minister-adjuvant-courier. In conclusion, we firstly provided scientific evidence to the classic theory of TCM formulae, an initiating holistic viewpoint of combination therapy of TCM. This study also illustrated that PCA might be an applicable method to analyze the complicated data of drug combination.

22952787|t|HPLC-MS/MS analysis of a traditional Chinese medical formulation of Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu-Tang and its pharmacokinetics after oral administration to rats.
22952787|a|Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang (BYHWT) is one of the most popular formulated traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, and is widely for prevention of ischemic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases and stroke-induced disability. A specific high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) has been developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of the nine main bioactive components, i.e., astragaloside I, astragaloside II, astragaloside IV, formononetin, ononin, calycosin, calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside, ligustilide and paeoniflorin in rat plasma after oral administration of BYHWT extract. This method was applied to investigate the pharmacokinetics in conscious and freely moving rats. No significant matrix effects were observed. The overall analytical procedure was rapid and reproducible, which makes it suitable for quantitative analysis of a large number of samples. Among them, three astragalosides and four isoflavones in A. membranaceus, ligustilide in Radix Angelicae Sinensis and Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong and paeoniflorin in Radix Paeoniae Rubra were identified. This developed method was then successfully applied to pharmacokinetic studies of the nine bioactive constituents after oral administration of BYHWT extracts in rats. The pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that astragaloside I, astragaloside II, astragaloside IV and ligustilide presented the phenomenon of double peaks. The other herbal ingredients of formononetin, ononin, calycosin, calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside and paeoniflorin appeared together in a single and plateau absorption phase. These phenomenona suggest that these components may have multiple absorption sites, regulation of enterohepatic circulation or the gastric emptying rate, or there is ingredient-ingredient interaction. These pharmacokinetic results provide a constructive contribution to better understand the absorption mechanism of BYHWT and to support additional clinical evaluation.

22768247|t|Neuroprotection of tanshinone IIA against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in rats.
22768247|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is associated with systemic inflammatory response. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been implicated in many inflammatory processes. Tanshinone IIA (TSA) is one of the active ingredients in danshen, which derived from the dried root or rhizome of Salviae miltiorrhizae Bge. Recent studies have demonstrated that TSA has protective effects against focal cerebral I/R injury. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here we put forward the hypothesis that TSA acts through inhibition of MIF expression during focal cerebral I/R injury in rats. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 hours. This was followed by reperfusion. We measured neurological deficits, brain water content, and infarct volume, and found that neurological dysfunction, brain edema, and brain infarction were significantly attenuated by TSA 6 hours after reperfusion. We also measured myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity at 6 and 24 hours, and found that neutrophil infiltration was significantly higher in the vehicle+I/R group than in the TSA+I/R group. ELISA demonstrated that TSA could inhibit MIF expression and the release of TNF-α and IL-6 induced by I/R injury. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining showed that MIF expression was significantly lower in the TSA+I/R group than in the vehicle+I/R group. MIF was found almost all located in neurons and hardly any located in astrocytes in the cerebral cortex. Western blot analysis and EMSA demonstrated that NF-κB expression and activity were significantly increased in the vehicle+I/R group. However, these changes were attenuated by TSA. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that TSA helps alleviate the proinflammatory responses associated with I/R-induced injury and that this neuroprotective effect may occur through down-regulation of MIF expression in neurons.

21664366|t|Ginsenoside Rd attenuates redox imbalance and improves stroke outcome after focal cerebral ischemia in aged mice.
21664366|a|We previously found that ginsenoside Rd (Rd), one of the main active ingredients in Panax ginseng, protects against ischemic brain damage induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo. Considering stroke happens frequently in aged individuals, we herein sought to further define the protective effects of Rd in the aged mice. 16-18-month-old mice administered with Rd (0.1-200 mg/kg) or vehicle were subjected to transient MCAO. Rd at the doses of 10-50 mg/kg significantly reduced both cortical and striatal infarct volume. This protection was associated with an improvement in neurological function and was sustained for at least 2 weeks after the insult. Importantly, Rd was effective even when administered up to 4 h after recirculation. To evaluate the underlying mechanisms, oxidative DNA damage was identified by 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine immunostaining, oxidative protein damage was identified by the assessment of protein carbonyl, and lipid peroxidation was estimated by determining the malondialdehyde formation. Rd significantly suppressed the accumulations of DNA, protein and lipid peroxidation products at 24 h post-ischemia. Rd also protected mitochondria at 4 and 24 h after reperfusion as indicated by preserved respiratory chain complex activities and aconitase activity, lowered mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production, and hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, Rd partly enhanced endogenous antioxidant activities following MCAO. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that Rd exerts neuroprotection against transient focal ischemia in the aged brain, which may be associated with the attenuation of redox imbalance.

21647765|t|Ginsenoside rd in experimental stroke: superior neuroprotective efficacy with a wide therapeutic window.
21647765|a|Ginsenoside Rd (Rd), one of the main active ingredients in Panax ginseng, has been demonstrated to protect against ischemic cerebral damage in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we aimed to further define the preclinical characteristics of Rd. We show that Rd passes the intact blood-brain barrier and exerts protection in both transient and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. In the dose-response study, Rd (10-50 mg/Kg) significantly reduced the infarct volume on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, and 7. This protection was associated with an improved neurological outcome for as many as 6 weeks after transient MCAO, as assessed by modified neurological severity score, modified sticky-tape test, and corner test. For comparison, Rd was significantly more effective than edaravone and slightly more effective than N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN). In the therapeutic window study, Rd exhibited remarkable neuroprotection, even when administered for as many as 4 h after the recirculation of transient MCAO or after the onset of permanent MCAO. Furthermore, in female rats or 16-month-old male rats, the salutary effects of Rd were also observed. These findings suggest Rd is a promising neuroprotectant and provide support for future clinical studies to confirm whether Rd is beneficial in ischemic stroke.

21219973|t|Ginsenoside Rd attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction and sequential apoptosis after transient focal ischemia.
21219973|a|We previously found that ginsenoside Rd (Rd), one of the major active ingredients in Panax ginseng, protects neuronal cells from hydrogen peroxide and oxygen-glucose deprivation, an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia. In this study, we examined the protective effects of Rd in an animal model of focal cerebral ischemia. Rats administered with Rd or vehicle were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Rd (50 mg/kg) significantly reduced the infarct volume by 52.8%. This reduction of injury volume was associated with an improvement in neurological function and was sustained for at least 2 weeks after the induction of ischemia. To evaluate the underlying mechanisms of Rd against stroke, brain tissues were assayed for mitochondrial enzyme activities, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), energy metabolites, and apoptosis. Rd markedly protected mitochondria as indicated by preserved respiratory chain complex activities and aconitase activity, lowered mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production, and hyperpolarized MMP. Microdialysis results illustrated that Rd significantly decreased the accumulation of lactate, the end product of anaerobic glycolysis, and increased pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, hence inducing a lower lactate/pyruvate ratio. Additionally, in vitro studies further exhibited that Rd protected isolated mitochondria from calcium-induced damage by attenuating mitochondrial swelling, preserving MMP and decreasing ROS production. Moreover, Rd treatment reduced mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (CytoC) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), thereby minimizing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis following ischemia. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that Rd exerts neuroprotective effects in transient focal ischemia, which may involve an integrated process of the mitochondrial protection, energy restoration and inhibition of apoptosis.

21293466|t|Active ingredients in Chinese medicines promoting blood circulation as Na+/K+ -ATPase inhibitors.
21293466|a|The positive inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides lies in their reversible inhibition on the membrane-bound Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in human myocardium. Steroid-like compounds containing a core structure similar to cardiac glycosides are found in many Chinese medicines conventionally used for promoting blood circulation. Some of them are demonstrated to be Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitors and thus putatively responsible for their therapeutic effects via the same molecular mechanism as cardiac glycosides. On the other hand, magnesium lithospermate B of danshen is also proposed to exert its cardiac therapeutic effect by effectively inhibiting Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Theoretical modeling suggests that the number of hydrogen bonds and the strength of hydrophobic interaction between the effective ingredients of various medicines and residues around the binding pocket of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase are crucial for the inhibitory potency of these active ingredients. Ginsenosides, the active ingredients in ginseng and sanqi, substantially inhibit Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase when sugar moieties are attached only to the C-3 position of their steroid-like structure, equivalent to the sugar position in cardiac glycosides. Their inhibitory potency is abolished, however, when sugar moieties are linked to C-6 or C-20 position of the steroid nucleus; presumably, these sugar attachments lead to steric hindrance for the entrance of ginsenosides into the binding pocket of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Neuroprotective effects of cardiac glycosides, several steroid-like compounds, and magnesium lithospermate B against ischemic stroke have been accordingly observed in a cortical brain slice-based assay model, and cumulative data support that effective inhibitors of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in the brain could be potential drugs for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

21185898|t|Ginsenoside Rd attenuates early oxidative damage and sequential inflammatory response after transient focal ischemia in rats.
21185898|a|We previously found that ginsenoside Rd (Rd), one of the main active ingredients in Panax ginseng, attenuates neuronal oxidative damage in vitro induced by hydrogen peroxide and oxygen-glucose deprivation. In this study, we sought to investigate the potential protective effects and associated mechanisms of Rd in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Rats administered with Rd (0.1-200mg/kg) or vehicle was subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Rd at the dose of 10-50mg/kg significantly reduced the infarct volume and improved the long-term neurological outcome up to 6 weeks after ischemia. To evaluate the underlying mechanisms, in vivo free radical generation was monitored using microdialysis, oxidative DNA damage was identified by 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine immunostaining, oxidative protein damage was identified by the assessment of protein carbonyl and advanced glycosylation end products, and lipid peroxidation was estimated by determining the malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal formations. Microdialysis results displayed a prominent inhibitory effect of Rd on the hydroxy radical formation trapped as 2,3- and 2,5-DHBA. Early accumulations of DNA, protein and lipid peroxidation products were also suppressed by Rd treatment. Although Rd partly preserved endogenous antioxidant activities in the ischemic penumbra, in sham rats without stroke, endogenous antioxidant activities were not affected by Rd. Furthermore, we assayed sequential inflammatory response in a later phase after ischemia. Rd significantly eliminated inflammatory injury as indicated by the suppression of microglial activation, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that Rd exerts neuroprotection in transient focal ischemia, which may involve early free radicals scavenging pathway and a late anti-inflammatory effect.

22115353|t|Therapeutic applications of organosulfur compounds as novel hydrogen sulfide donors and/or mediators.
22115353|a|Hydrogen sulfide, once considered as toxic gas, is now recognized as an important biological mediator. The deficiency of hydrogen sulfide could lead to various pathological changes, such as arterial and pulmonary hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, gastric mucosal injury and liver cirrhosis. However, excessive production of hydrogen sulfide, by using inorganic hydrogen sulfide donors such as NaHS, may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, septic shock, cerebral stroke and mental retardation in patients with Down syndrome. Therefore, an increasing interest in organic molecules that are capable of regulating the formation of hydrogen sulfide has extended in recent years. Allium vegetables are one natural source of organic sulfur-containing compounds and have been widely investigated regarding their therapeutic applications, and it has been proven that the ingredients of garlic, such as diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide and S-ally cysteine act as hydrogen sulfide donors or mediators in pharmaceutical studies. In addition, S-propargyl cysteine (ZYZ-802) and S-propyl cysteine, two synthetic cysteine analogs, have been examined and could be used to treat ischemic heart disease via modulation of the hydrogen sulfide pathway. In addition, drugs containing hydrogen sulfide-releasing moieties have been synthesized and widely reported in recent years, such as S-nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the derivative of Lawesson's reagents, which exhibit varied biological effects in experiments. As cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase are the enzymes that are able to catalyze the production of endogenous hydrogen sulfide from cysteine, their inhibitors, such as dl-propylargylglycine and β-cyanoalanine, have been frequently used in studies on the biological mechanism of hydrogen sulfide. All these hydrogen sulfide donors, mediators and inhibitors have provided useful tools in the research of a variety of biological effects and are promising drug candidates of hydrogen sulfide.

21060079|t|Translation and implementation of added sugars consumption recommendations: a conference report from the American Heart Association Added Sugars Conference 2010.
21060079|a|BACKGROUND: A 2-day forum was convened to (1) discuss ways to translate the 2009 American Heart Association added sugars recommendations into actions in areas such as regulation, food labeling, nutrient content claims, and practical application in the American diet; (2) review surveillance methodology and metrics for tracking and understanding the impact of reducing added sugars in the diet; and (3) initiate the development of a framework for future collaboration to help Americans implement science-based guidance relative to added sugars. METHODS AND RESULTS: More than 100 multinational participants representing scientists from academia and government and stakeholders engaged in food production, development, and processing, food manufacturing and servicing, food and nutrition policy, and nutrition recommendations for the public attended the conference. Presentations included definitions and examples of added sugars, current US and international added sugars perspectives, added sugars in diets of individuals and in the food supply, food technology behind added sugars, added sugars and health, food manufacturer perspectives, added sugars food-labeling considerations, and examples of positive approaches to improve eating behaviors and the food environment. Facilitated breakout sessions were conducted after the plenary sessions to allow participants to contribute their expertise and thoughts. CONCLUSION: The American Heart Association Added Sugars Conference is the first step in an important process that facilitates collaboration across science, public health, and industry to foster innovation, partnerships, policy, and implementation of new products and services for the benefit of the health and well-being of the American public. Science has advanced in the area of added sugars and health, creating mounting pressure to use better methods for translation and dissemination of the science for consumer education and for food companies to respond by producing foods and beverages with fewer added sugars. The new science also reinforces the importance of preventing, rather than simply treating diseases, especially overweight and obesity, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Reducing added sugars consumption is a good target for addressing obesity, along with other sources of excess calories. However, the potential unintended consequences of substituting added sugars with ingredients that may not reduce calories and of increasing other macronutrients or food groups that may not result in a net health gain must be considered. Although there are many challenges to incorporating added sugars to the food label as was discussed during the conference, disclosure of added sugars content on food and beverage labels is an essential element in consumer education and can provide the information and motivation for making healthier food choices. This conference demonstrated the value of interactive dialogue among multiple sectors and disciplines. More disciplines should be at the table to bring expertise to discuss cross-cutting issues related to public policies and offer diverse insights to finding a solution.

20570121|t|The effects of Tanshinone IIA on blood-brain barrier and brain edema after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.
20570121|a|Disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and edema formation play a key role in the development of neurological dysfunction after cerebral ischemia. In this study, the effects of Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), one of the active ingredients of Salvia miltiorrhiza root, on the BBB and brain edema after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats were examined. Our study demonstrated that Tan IIA reduced brain infarct area, water content in the ischemic hemisphere. Furthermore, Tan IIA significantly decreased BBB permeability to Evans blue, suppressed the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), inhibited the degradation of tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Occludin. These results demonstrated that Tan IIA was effective for attenuating the extent of brain edema formation in response to ischemia injury in rats, partly by Tan IIA's protective effect on the BBB. Our results may have implications in the treatment of brain edema in cerebral ischemia.

20623618|t|Preferential inhibition by antidiarrheic 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol of Ca(2+) influx across acquired N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels composed of NR1/NR2B subunit assembly.
20623618|a|In our previous studies, particular phenolic ingredients, such as 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (2M4MP), of the antidiarrheic drug wood creosote significantly prevented cell death by both hydrogen peroxide and glutamate in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. In this study, we further evaluated the pharmacological properties of 2M4MP on Ca(2+) influx across native and acquired N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) channels. The addition of 2M4MP significantly prevented the loss of cellular viability and the increase in intracellular free Ca(2+) levels as determined by Fluo-3 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons briefly exposed to NMDA. Brief exposure to NMDA also led to a marked increase in mitochondrial free Ca(2+) levels determined by Rhod-2, in addition to intracellular free Ca(2+) levels, in HEK293 cells expressing either NR1/NR2A or NR1/NR2B subunit channels. The further addition of the general NMDAR channel blocker dizocilpine similarly inhibited the increase of intracellular Ca(2+) levels by NMDA in both types of acquired NMDAR channels, whereas the NR2B subunit selective antagonist ifenprodil drastically inhibited the increase by NMDA in HEK293 cells expressing NR1/NR2B, but not NR1/NR2A, subunits. Similarly, 2M4MP significantly and selectively inhibited the NMDA-induced influx of Ca(2+) across acquired NR1/NR2B channels in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, prior daily oral administration of 2M4MP significantly reduced the infarct volume in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion 1 day after reperfusion. These results suggest that 2M4MP may protect neurons from excitotoxicity through preferential inhibition of Ca(2+) influx across NMDAR channels composed of NR1/NR2B subunits.

20138073|t|Role of dairy beverages in the diet.
20138073|a|The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends 3 cups of low fat milk or equivalent daily for most calorie levels [1]. Milk provides over 10% of the requirement for calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, riboflavin, protein, and carbohydrates for most people. Obtaining adequate intakes of calcium, potassium, and magnesium without milk in the diet requires effort. Milk has bioactive ingredients that may play unique roles in health. Benefits of dairy consumption are associated with reduced risk of low bone mass, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and some cancers. Concerns over milk consumption have focused on saturated fats historically. More research is needed to resolve potential concerns of milk consumption and risk of several disorders including ovarian cancer and soft tissue calcification.

20199692|t|Absolute risk representation in cardiovascular disease prevention: comprehension and preferences of health care consumers and general practitioners involved in a focus group study.
20199692|a|BACKGROUND: Communicating risk is part of primary prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke, collectively referred to as cardiovascular disease (CVD). In Australia, health organisations have promoted an absolute risk approach, thereby raising the question of suitable standardised formats for risk communication. METHODS: Sixteen formats of risk representation were prepared including statements, icons, graphical formats, alone or in combination, and with variable use of colours. All presented the same risk, i.e., the absolute risk for a 55 year old woman, 16% risk of CVD in five years. Preferences for a five or ten-year timeframe were explored. Australian GPs and consumers were recruited for participation in focus groups, with the data analysed thematically and preferred formats tallied. RESULTS: Three focus groups with health consumers and three with GPs were held, involving 19 consumers and 18 GPs. Consumers and GPs had similar views on which formats were more easily comprehended and which conveyed 16% risk as a high risk. A simple summation of preferences resulted in three graphical formats (thermometers, vertical bar chart) and one statement format as the top choices. The use of colour to distinguish risk (red, yellow, green) and comparative information (age, sex, smoking status) were important ingredients. Consumers found formats which combined information helpful, such as colour, effect of changing behaviour on risk, or comparison with a healthy older person. GPs preferred formats that helped them relate the information about risk of CVD to their patients, and could be used to motivate patients to change behaviour.Several formats were reported as confusing, such as a percentage risk with no contextual information, line graphs, and icons, particularly those with larger numbers. Whilst consumers and GPs shared preferences, the use of one format for all situations was not recommended. Overall, people across groups felt that risk expressed over five years was preferable to a ten-year risk, the latter being too remote. CONCLUSIONS: Consumers and GPs shared preferences for risk representation formats. Both groups liked the option to combine formats and tailor the risk information to reflect a specific individual's risk, to maximise understanding and provide a good basis for discussion.

19447300|t|Neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rd against oxygen-glucose deprivation in cultured hippocampal neurons.
19447300|a|We previously found that ginsenoside Rd (GSRd), one of the main active ingredients in Panax Ginseng, attenuates H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative injury in PC12 cells. Mounting evidence suggests that the oxidative stress is crucially involved in the pathophysiologic process of ischemia. In the present study, we examined the protective role of GSRd to attenuate ischemic neuronal injury in vitro. Cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 2h followed by a 24-h reoxygenation. GSRd exhibited remarkable neuroprotection when presented during OGD and reoxygenation, which may be ascribed to its antioxidative properties by reducing the intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde production; increasing glutathione content; and enhancing the antioxidant enzymatic activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Additionally, GSRd could stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential and attenuate apoptotic death of hippocampal neurons after OGD exposure. These findings suggested that GSRd may be a potential neuroprotective agent for cerebral ischemic injury and should encourage further in vivo studies on stroke to explore the potential neuroprotective efficacy of GSRd.

19289648|t|Cocoa and cardiovascular health.
19289648|a|Epidemiological data demonstrate that regular dietary intake of plant-derived foods and beverages reduces the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Among many ingredients, cocoa might be an important mediator. Indeed, recent research demonstrates a beneficial effect of cocoa on blood pressure, insulin resistance, and vascular and platelet function. Although still debated, a range of potential mechanisms through which cocoa might exert its benefits on cardiovascular health have been proposed, including activation of nitric oxide and antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects. This review summarizes the available data on the cardiovascular effects of cocoa, outlines potential mechanisms involved in the response to cocoa, and highlights the potential clinical implications associated with its consumption.

19592798|t|Socially assistive robotics for stroke and mild TBI rehabilitation.
19592798|a|This paper describes an interdisciplinary research project aimed at developing and evaluating effective and user-friendly non-contact robot-assisted therapy, aimed at in-home use. The approach stems from the emerging field of social cognitive neuroscience that seeks to understand phenomena in terms of interactions between the social, cognitive, and neural levels of analysis. This technology-assisted therapy is designed to be safe and affordable, and relies on novel human-robot interaction methods for accelerated recovery of upper-extremity function after lesion-induced hemiparesis. The work is based on the combined expertise in the science and technology of non-contact socially assistive robotics and the clinical science of neurorehabilitation and motor learning, brought together to study how to best enhance recovery after stroke and mild traumatic brain injury. Our approach is original and promising in that it combines several ingredients that individually have been shown to be important for learning and long-term efficacy in motor neurorehabilitation: (1) intensity of task specific training and (2) engagement and self-management of goal-directed actions. These principles motivate and guide the strategies used to develop novel user activity sensing and provide the rationale for development of socially assistive robotics therapy for monitoring and coaching users toward personalized and optimal rehabilitation programs.

18782607|t|Chinese medicinal herb Radix Astragali suppresses cardiac contractile dysfunction and inflammation in a rat model of autoimmune myocarditis.
18782607|a|Radix Astragali, a Chinese medicinal herb, consists of polysaccharides and flavonoids as its main active ingredients. It has been widely used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and stroke in Asian countries. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of Radix Astragali on myocardial dysfunction, cardiac remodeling and morphological alteration in an experimental model of autoimmune myocarditis, a clinical condition often resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy. Experimental autoimmune myocarditis was established with a subcutaneous injection of porcine cardiac myosin into rear footpad in Lewis rats. Radix Astragali treatment was delivered via an intravenous injection (0.2 ml/100g body weight, daily) for 3 weeks. Results from transthoracic echocardiography indicated that experimental autoimmune myocarditis led to impaired myocardial contractile function which was reconciled by Radix Astragali. The experimental autoimmune myocarditis triggered profound inflammation and fibrosis in myocardium as assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) and Masson's trichrome staining. Interestingly, Radix Astragali significantly attenuated autoimmune myocarditis-induced myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. Similarly, Radix Astragali treatment alleviated autoimmune myocarditis-triggered overt lymphocyte proliferation. Furthermore, Radix Astragali significantly attenuated elevated levels of the Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-2), and increased the Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in autoimmune myocarditis. Collectively, our data revealed that Radix Astragali effectively protected against cardiac functional and morphological aberrations in experimental autoimmune myocarditis.

18360685|t|Induction of heme oxygenase-1 by traditional Chinese medicine formulation ISF-1 and its ingredients as a cytoprotective mechanism against oxidative stress.
18360685|a|Traditional medicines are clinically used to treat post-stroke disorders in China. In search of alternative medicines for post-stroke rehabilitation, we recently identified the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway as a key mechanism underlying the biological activities of the ischemic stroke formulation ISF-1. This study was designed to further investigate ISF-1 for HO-1 induction in cultured human cells and corresponding cytoprotective effects against oxidative injury. A rat stroke model induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion was employed to verify the activity of ISF-1 in vivo. It was found that HO-1 expression was induced by ISF-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Four ingredients from ISF-1 were identified to be responsible for HO-1 induction. The appropriate combinations of these active ingredients or purified compounds resulted in synergistic induction of HO-1 expression. A minimal HO-1-inducing formulation was prepared and showed significant cytoprotection against H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Collectively, the herbal formulation ISF-1 was capable of inducing HO-1 expression, in vitro and in vivo, offering a potential mechanism for post-stroke rehabilitation. This study may shed light on the development of mechanism-defined therapies based on traditional herbal remedies.

21631815|t|How has the impact of 'care pathway technologies' on service integration in stroke care been measured and what is the strength of the evidence to support their effectiveness in this respect?
21631815|a|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:BACKGROUND: Across the developed world, we are witnessing an increasing emphasis on the need for more closely coordinated forms of health and social care provision. Integrated care pathways (ICPs) have emerged as a response to this aspiration and are believed by many to address the factors which contribute to service integration. ICPs map out a patient's journey, providing coordination of services for users. They aim to have: 'the right people, doing the right things, in the right order, at the right time, in the right place, with the right outcome'. The value for ICPs in supporting the delivery of care across organisational boundaries, providing greater consistency in practice, improving service continuity and increasing collaboration has been advocated by many. However, there is little evidence to support their use, and the need for systematic evaluations in order to measure their effectiveness has been widely identified. A recent Cochrane review assessed the effects of ICPs on functional outcome, process of care, quality of life and hospitalisation costs of inpatients with acute stroke, but did not specifically focus on service integration or its derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, no such systematic review of the literature exists. OBJECTIVES: • To systematically review all high-quality studies which have evaluated the impact of care pathway technologies on 'service integration' and its derivatives in stroke care • To examine how elements of service integration are defined in such studies • To examine the type of evidence utilised to measure service integration • To analyse the weight of evidence used to support claims about the effectiveness of ICPs on improving service integration • To produce recommendations for ICP developers, users and evaluators. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Types of participants The review focused on the care of adult patients who had suffered a stroke. It included the full spectrum of services - acute care, rehabilitation and long-term support - in hospital and community settings. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest Integrated care pathways were the intervention of interest, defined for the purpose of this review as 'a multidisciplinary tool to improve the quality and efficiency of evidence based care and is used as a communication tool between professionals to manage and standardise the outcome orientated care' Here 'multidisciplinary' is taken to refer to the involvement of two or more disciplines. Types of outcomes 'Service integration' was the outcome of interest however, this was defined and measured in the selected studies. Types of studies This review was concerned with how 'service integration' was defined in evaluations of ICPs; the type of evidence utilised in measuring the impact of the intervention and the weight of evidence to support the effectiveness of care pathway technologies on 'service integration'. Studies that made an explicit link between ICPs and service integration were included in the review. Evidence generated from randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental, qualitative and health economics research was sought. The search was limited to publications after 1980, coinciding with the emergence of ICPs in the healthcare context. Assessment for inclusion of foreign papers was based on the English-language abstract, where available. These were included only if an English translation was available. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: This review excluded studies that: • focused only on a single aspect of stroke care (e.g. dysphasia) • evaluated ICPs as part of a wider program of service development • did not make an explicit link between ICPs and service integration • did not meet the definition of ICP utilised for the purposes of the review • focused exclusively on the outcomes of variance analysis SEARCH STRATEGY: In order to avoid replication, the Joanna Briggs Institute for Evidence Based Nursing and Midwifery Database and the Cochrane Library were searched to establish that no systematic reviews existed and none were in progress. A three-stage search strategy was then used to identify both published and unpublished studies (see Appendix III). DATA COLLECTION: Our search strategy located 2123 papers, of which 39 were retrieved for further evaluation. We critically appraised seven papers, representing five studies. These were all evaluation studies and, as is typical in this field, comprised a range of study designs and data collection methods. Owing to the diversity of the study types included in the review, we developed a single-appraisal checklist and data-extraction tool which could be applied to all research designs.(32) The tool drew on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal checklists for experimental studies and interpretive and critical research, and also incorporated specific information and issues which were relevant for our purposes (see Appendix VI). This extends the thinking outlined in Lyne et al.(31) in which, drawing on Campbell and Stanley's classic paper, the case is made for developing an appraisal tool which is applicable to all types of evaluation, irrespective of study design. In assessing the quality of the papers, we were sympathetic to the methodological challenges of evaluating complex interventions such as ICPs. We were also cognisant of the very real constraints in which service evaluations are frequently undertaken in healthcare contexts. In accordance with the aims of this particular review, we have included studies, which are methodologically weaker than is typical of many systematic reviews because, in our view, in the absence of stronger evidence, they yield useful information. DATA SYNTHESIS: Given the heterogeneity of the included studies, meta-analysis and/or qualitative synthesis was not possible. A narrative summary of the study findings is presented. RESULTS: 1 ICPs can be effective in ensuring that patients receive relevant clinical interventions and/or assessments in a timely manner, although these improvements may reflect better documentation rather than actual changes in practice. 2 ICPs can be effective in improving the documentation of rehabilitation goals, documentation of communication with patients, carers (diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up arrangements) and documentation of notification of primary care physicians of discharge. However, this can create additional burdens of work for staff. 3 Early studies of ICP-managed care in the acute stroke context have demonstrated reduced length of stay without any associated adverse effects on discharge destination, morbidity or mortality. These effects do not reach statistical significance, however, and may reflect wider changes in service provision and a general trend towards reduced length of hospital stay. While later studies in the acute and rehabilitation contexts do not reveal any significant reduction in length of stay, they do report greater documented use of certain clinical interventions and assessments, suggesting that ICPs can be effective in mobilising hospital resources around the patient. 4 ICPs implemented in the context of acute stroke care can be effective in reducing the occurrence of urinary tract infections, although we do not know whether this can be attributed to improved service integration. 5 ICP management in stroke rehabilitation may not be flexible enough to meet diverse patient needs and can result in insufficient attention to higher-level functioning and carer needs influencing perceptions of quality of life. 6 ICP management may assist in clarifying role boundaries and a shared understanding of the work, but this can result in some members of the disciplinary team perceiving that their contribution is not appropriately reflected in the documentation. 7 There is some evidence that ICPs may be effective in changing professional behaviours in the desired direction where there is scope for improvement, but in situations in which multidisciplinary working is effective, their positive effects may be limited. Furthermore, it is far from clear what the active ingredients of ICPs actually are. Kwan et al. suggest that it was the process of ICP development that had most impact on behaviours rather than the use of the artefact per se.(20) 8 None of the studies assessed the balance of costs and benefits of ICP use. Therefore, we do not know whether the costs of ICP development and implementation are justified by any of the reported benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Implications for practice There is some evidence that ICPs may support certain elements of service integration in the context of stroke care. This seems to be as a result of their ability to support the timely implementation of clinical interventions and the mobilisation of resources around the patient without incurring additional increases in length of stay. ICPs appear to be most successful in improving service coordination in the acute stroke context where patient care trajectories are predictable. Their value in the context of rehabilitation settings in which recovery pathways are more variable is less clear. There is some evidence that ICPs may be effective in bringing about behavioural changes in contexts where deficiencies in service provision have been identified. Their value in contexts where inter-professional working is well established is less clear. While earlier before and after studies show a reduction in length of stay in ICP-managed care, this may reflect wider healthcare trends, and the failure of later studies to demonstrate further reductions suggests that there may be limits as to how far this can continue to be reduced. There is some evidence to suggest that ICPs bring about improvements in documentation, but we do not know how far documented practice reflects actual practice.

18309437|a|OBJECTIVES: To analyse, describe and compare the frequency and energy intake of eating events, including specific food items, among diseased older men living in ordinary housing. DESIGN: Descriptive and explorative. SETTING: Interviews were performed in the participants' home. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five co-living and 26 single-living men, 64-88 years of age. Participants had one of three chronic diseases associated with difficulties in buying and preparing food and with difficulties related to the meal situation: Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis or stroke. MEASUREMENTS: A repeated 24-h recall was used to assess food intake and meal patterns. RESULTS: Eating events were distributed over a 24-h period. Co-living men had a higher (p=0.001) number of eating events/day; both hot and cold eating events were consumed more frequently. There was no difference between groups concerning energy intake. Co-living men more often had hot eating events cooked from raw ingredients (p=0.001) and a greater mix of vegetables/roots (p=0.003) included in such eating events. CONCLUSION: Single-living men may constitute a vulnerable group from a nutritional perspective, while co-living men, besides the pleasure of eating with another person, seem to get support with food and eating events from their partners. Hence, the group of single-living men, particularly those with a disability, should receive particular attention with regard to possible food-related difficulties.

18402239|t|[Can cardiovascular diseases be reduced over 80% by a "superpill"? Review on the epidemiological study from Wald and Law, 2003].
18402239|a|As a consequence of our "western" diet and lifestyle, the risk for cardiovascular diseases is increased in the western world. It can be decreased by influencing the LDL-cholesterol values, the blood pressure and the platelet aggregation. It is, however, not proven that lowering of serum homocysteine levels reduces the risk forcardiovascular diseases. Wald and Law suggest in their epidemiological study a polypill, which has as its ingredients a statin, an anti-hypertonic drug, folic acid, and aspirine. Overall, the risk reduction by a polypill is overestimated, since a threshold is currently not existing, in all drugs side effects and interactions are possible, pharmaceuticals are only labelled for specific indications, and with missing efficacy there could be a negative risk-benefit-relation. Indeed, a combined therapy with different drugs is in place in patients with higher risk and for secondary prevention, which is already risk-adjusted. The use of effective drugs, however, in patients without evidence of a positive risk-benefit-relation and without medical control cannot be justified. Therefore, the application of the polypill for subjects beyond 55 years of age is an illusion; by contrast, treatment of patients with a high risk for atherosclerotic diseases is already reality.

17959252|t|Comparison of biochemical effects of statins and fish oil in brain: the battle of the titans.
17959252|a|Neural membranes are composed of glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol and proteins. The distribution of these lipids within the neural membrane is not random but organized. Neural membranes contain lipid rafts or microdomains that are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol. These rafts act as platforms for the generation of glycerophospholipid-, sphingolipid-, and cholesterol-derived second messengers, lipid mediators that are necessary for normal cellular function. Glycerophospholipid-derived lipid mediators include eicosanoids, docosanoids, lipoxins, and platelet-activating factor. Sphingolipid-derived lipid mediators include ceramides, ceramide 1-phosphates, and sphingosine 1-phosphate. Cholesterol-derived lipid mediators include 24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol. Abnormal signal transduction processes and enhanced production of lipid mediators cause oxidative stress and inflammation. These processes are closely associated with the pathogenesis of acute neural trauma (stroke, spinal cord injury, and head injury) and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. Statins, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are effective lipid lowering agents that significantly reduce risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Beneficial effects of statins in neurological diseases are due to their anti-excitotoxic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Fish oil omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, have similar anti-excitotoxic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in brain tissue. Thus the lipid mediators, resolvins, protectins, and neuroprotectins, derived from eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid retard neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptotic cell death in brain tissue. Like statins, ingredients of fish oil inhibit generation of beta-amyloid and provide protection from oxidative stress and inflammatory processes. Collective evidence suggests that antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties of statins and fish oil contribute to the clinical efficacy of treating neurological disorders with statins and fish oil. We speculate that there is an overlap between neurochemical events associated with neural cell injury in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. This commentary compares the neurochemical effects of statins with those of fish oil.

18158825|t|Soy isoflavones as safe functional ingredients.
18158825|a|In recent years, isoflavones have increased in popularity as an alternative to estrogen therapy, particularly after the Women's Health Initiative demonstrated an increased risk of breast cancer, stroke, and heart attacks in response to estrogen and progesterone intervention. Isoflavones are heterocyclic phenols with structural similarity to estradiol-17beta and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Actions at the cellular level depend on the target tissue, receptor status of the tissue, and the level of endogenous estrogen. Clinical studies of soy-based diets evaluating the relation between soy consumption and serum lipid concentrations revealed that soy consumption significantly decreased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Epidemiological studies suggest a protective effect of soy protein on breast tissue as evidenced by the lower rates of breast cancer in East Asian countries where soy is a predominant part of the diet. Soy products also alleviate menopausal symptoms by reducing hot flashes. However, whether these biological effects of soy products originated from isoflavones is not clear. Furthermore, data available from human studies on the effect of isoflavones on osteoporosis are limited, and additional studies are needed to support a role in osteoporosis prevention. To date, no adverse effects of short- or long-term use of soy proteins are known in humans, and the only adverse effects known are those reported in animals. In conclusion, isoflavones are biologically active compounds, and current data are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions regarding the use of isoflavones as an alternative to estrogen for hormone replacement in postmenopausal women. Large, long-term intervention studies examining adverse effects and disease outcomes are needed before definitive conclusion can be drawn.

17678818|t|The octave potencies convention: a mathematical model of dilution and succussion.
17678818|a|Several hypothesized explanations for homeopathy posit that remedies contain a concentration of discrete information-carrying units, such as water clusters, nano-bubbles, or silicates. For any such explanation to be sustainable, dilution must reduce and succussion must restore the concentration of these units. Succussion can be modeled by a logistic equation, which leads to mathematical relationships involving the maximum concentration, the average growth of information-carrying units rate per succussion stroke, the number of succussion strokes, and the dilution factor (x, c, or LM). When multiple species of information-carrying units are present, the fastest-growing species will eventually come to dominate, as the potency is increased. An analogy is explored between iterated cycles dilution and succussion, in making homeopathic remedies, and iterated cycles of reseeding and growth, in bacterial cultures. Drawing on this analogy, the active ingredients in low and medium potency remedies may be present at early dilutions but only gradually come to 'dominate', while high potencies may develop from the occurrence of low-probability but faster-growing 'mutations.' Conclusions from this model include: 'x' and 'c' potencies are best compared by the amount of dilution, not the amount of succussion; the minimum number of succussion strokes needed per cycle is proportional to the logarithm of the dilution factor; and a plausible interpretation of why potencies at approximately regular ratios are traditionally used (the octave potencies convention).

17633364|t|[Comparative study of Buyang Huanwu Decoction and the different combinations of its ingredients on neurogenesis following ischemic stroke in rats].
17633364|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) and the different combinations of its ingredients on neurogenesis following ischemic stroke in rats. METHODS: The model rats of ischemic stroke was established by blocking cerebral media artery with electrocoagulation through craniectomy, and electric stimulation, given from 24 h after blocking, 2 h daily for 15 successive days. They were divided into four groups, Group A treated with saline, Group B treated with BYHWD, Group C treated with BYHWD but earthworm subtracted, and Group D treated with Danggui Buxue Decoction (DGBXD). The expression of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in cerebral tissue was determined by immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: Large amount of BrdU immunoreactive cells presented in the hippocampal region of rats in Group B and C, densely arranged, partial in cluster, with the figure significantly different to that in Group A (P < 0.01), and the amount in the ischemic side was significantly more than that in the opposite side (P < 0.05). While comparing between Group A and D, the amount of BrdU immunoreactive cells in the hippocampal region showed insignificant difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: BYHWD has a effect in promoting neurogenesis better than DGBXD.

17397998|t|Tanshinone IIB, a primary active constituent from Salvia miltiorrhza, exhibits neuro-protective activity in experimentally stroked rats.
17397998|a|Tanshinone IIB (TSB) is a major active constituent of the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) used in the treatment of acute stroke. Danshen extracts and TSB have shown marked neuron-protective effects in mouse studies but there is a lack of clinical evidence for the neuron-protective effects of Danshen and its active ingredients. This study investigated the neuron-protective effects of TSB in experimentally stroked rats. TSB at 5 and 25 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection significantly reduced the focal infarct volume, cerebral histological damage and apoptosis in rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) compared to MCAO rats receiving vehicle. This study demonstrated that TSB was effective in reducing stroke-induced brain damage and may represent a novel drug candidate for further development. Further mechanistic studies are needed for the neuron-protective activity of TSB.

17330510|t|Effect of chlorella and its fractions on blood pressure, cerebral stroke lesions, and life-span in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.
17330510|a|Effects of Chlorella regularis (dried cell powder)--cultured axenically under heterotrophic conditions, and provided as a dietary supplement--and its fractions on the blood pressure, cerebral stroke lesions, and life-span of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP/Izm) were investigated. When SHRSP were fed on diets with supplemented Chlorella to a commercial diet (Funabashi SP), elevation of blood pressure was significantly lower in the Chlorella groups than in the control group. At 21 wk of feeding, serum total cholesterol was significantly lower in the Chlorella groups than in the control group. Histopathological examination revealed cerebral vascular accidents in the brains of the control group, but those of Chlorella groups showed apparently low incidence compared to the control group. The average life-span of the Chlorella groups were significantly longer than that of the control group (p < 0.001). Chlorella powder was fractionated into three fractions, lipid-soluble, hot water-soluble, and residual fractions. The diets supplemented with lipid or residual fractions equivalent to 10% Chlorella significantly suppressed elevation of blood pressure in SHRSP, and then decreased the incidence rate of cerebral vessel lesions compared to the control group. Chemical analysis revealed that the lipid fraction contained large quantities of antioxidants, including carotenoids (especially lutein) and others, and phospholipids involved in aorta collagen and elastin metabolism; the residual fraction contained high concentrations of arginine, enhancing the function of blood vessels. The control diet contained only a little these substances. These experimental results suggest that the beneficial effect of Chlorella on SHRSP is caused by the synergistic action of several ingredients of Chlorella, which play a role in sustention of a vascular function of rats.

17302964|t|Preclinical and clinical examinations of Salvia miltiorrhiza and its tanshinones in ischemic conditions.
17302964|a|Salvia miltiorrhiza (Labiatae, Laminaceae), danshen, is an annual sage mainly found in China and neighboring countries. The crude drug (dried root) and its preparations are currently used in China to treat patients suffering from heart attack, angina pectoris, stroke and some other conditions. The use of S. miltiorrhiza has been increasing in the management of stroke. Pharmacological examinations showed that the plant and its active ingredients, tanshinones and salvianolic acids, have anticoagulant, vasodilatory, increased blood flow, anti-inflammatory, free radical scavenging, mitochondrial protective and other activities. This review discusses the pharmacology, medicinal chemistry and clinical studies published, especially in China, for danshen and tanshinone preparations. Clinical examinations are evaluated in terms of S. miltiorrhiza preparation, dose, double blinding, control, clinical assessments of outcomes and other parameters. Meta-analyses of S. miltiorrhiza are also discussed.

15531085|t|Tetramethylpyrazine reduces ischemic brain injury in rats.
15531085|a|Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), which is widely used in the treatment of ischemic stroke by Chinese herbalists, is one of the most important active ingredients of the traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Ligusticum wallichii Franchat (Chung Xiong). However, the mechanism by which TMP protects the brain is still not clear. We examined neuroprotective effects of TMP after transient focal cerebral ischemia using common carotid artery and middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats and evaluated the involvement of anti-inflammation. TMP administrated intraperitoneally significantly protected the brain against ischemic insult as evidenced by the reduction in infarction volume, preservation of neurons, and decrease in brain edema. TMP markedly reduced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced inflammatory cell activation and proinflammatory mediator production. Moreover, TMP suppressed lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma-induced inflammation and prostaglandin E(2) production in cultured glial cells. Our findings suggest that one of neuroprotective effects of TMP against ischemic brain injury might involve its anti-inflammatory potential.

15051858|t|Hypotensive peptides from milk proteins.
15051858|a|Hypertension is the major controllable risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and end-stage diabetes. A 5 mm Hg decrease in blood pressure has been equated with approximately 16% decrease in CVD. In the U.S. alone current annual antihypertensive drug costs are approximately dollars 15 billion. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a target for blood pressure control. Cleavage of angiotensinogen by renin produces angiotensin I which is subsequently hydrolyzed by angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II (a potent vasoconstrictor). Various side effects are associated with the use of ACE inhibitory drugs in the control of blood pressure including hypotension, increased potassium levels, reduced renal function, cough, angioedema, skin rashes, and fetal abnormalities. Milk proteins, both caseins and whey proteins, are a rich source of ACE inhibitory peptides. Several studies in spontaneously hypertensive rats show that these casokinins and lactokinins can significantly reduce blood pressure. Furthermore, a limited number of human studies have associated milk protein-derived peptides with statistically significant hypotensive effects (i.e., lower systolic and diastolic pressures). The advent of effective milk protein based functional food ingredients/nutraceuticals for the prevention/control of blood pressure therefore has the potential to significantly reduce global healthcare cost.

12723760|t|Hepatoprotective activity of reduohanxiao-tang (yuldahanso-tang) is related to the inhibition of beta-glucuronidase.
12723760|a|Beta-glucuronidase-inhibitory and hepatoprotective effects of Reduohanxiao-tang (Yuldahanso-tang), which has been used for liver diseases and stroke, on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity of rats were investigated. Reduohanxiao-tang potently inhibited beta-glucuronidases. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) levels of the CCl4 group orally treated with Reduohanxiao-tang (100 mg/kg) were lowered to 54%, 71.5% and 66.1% of the CCl4-treated control group, respectively. Among the ingredients of the Reduohanxiao-tang, the rhizomes of Pueraria thunbergiana and Scutellaria baicalensis potently inhibited beta-glucuronidases and protected against CCl4-induced liver injury. Orally administered puerarin, which is a main component of Pueraria thunbergiana, showed potent hepatoprotective activity, but did not inhibit beta-glucuronidase. However, daidzein, which is produced from puerarin by human intestinal bacteria, potently inhibited beta-glucuronidase. These results suggest that beta-glucuronidase inhibition by herbal medicines may protect against CCl4-induced liver injury.

12204769|t|Hwangryun-Hae-Dok-tang (Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang) extract and its constituents reduce ischemia-reperfusion brain injury and neutrophil infiltration in rats.
12204769|a|The preventive effect of Hwangryun-Hae-Dok-tang (HHDT, Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang), a Chinese herbal medicine, and its ingredients on ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury was evaluated in the rat brain. HHDT consists of four herbs, namely, Coptidis rhizoma, Scutellariae radix, Phellodendri cortex, and Gardeniae fructus. Ischemia was induced by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 120 min and reperfusion was continued for 22 h. HHDT (200 mg/kg), Coptidis rhizoma (100 mg/kg), Scutellariae radix (100 mg/kg), Phellodendri cortex (100 mg/kg), and Gardeniae fructus (100 mg/kg) were orally administered, promptly prior to reperfusion and 2 h after reperfusion. Baicalein, a component of Scutellariae radix, was also examined at a dosage of 50 mg/kg given 2 h apart, promptly prior to and 2 h after reperfusion. Total infarction volume in the ipsilateral hemisphere of ischemia/reperfusion rats was significantly lowered by treatment with HHDT, Scutellariae radix, and balicalein. However, the other ingredient of HHDT did not show any ameliorating effects on total infarction volume. The inhibiting effect of Scutellariae radix on total infarction volume was much higher than that of the others. In addition, HHDT, Scutellariae radix, and baicalein significantly inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, an index of neutrophil infiltration in ischemic brain tissue at about the same rate (30%). There was marked mismatch between total infarction volume and MPO activity in the Scutellariae radix-treated rats but not in the HHDT- and baicalein-treated groups. Our findings suggest that Scutellariae radix as an ingredient of HHDT plays a crucial protective role in ischemia-induced brain injury. In addition, it is apparent that the effect of Scutellariae radix is the result, in part, of baicalein, a compound contained in Scutellariae radix.

12215760|t|[Future potential indications for an oral thrombin inhibitor].
12215760|a|By the use of conventional anticoagulants, significant improvements were achieved in all fields of medicine. Although efficacious and widely used, their use is limited in several respects. In particular, the use of vitamin K antagonists is restricted in the clinical routine setting. The main reasons are the delayed on- and off-set of action, the narrow therapeutic window, the necessity of individual laboratory-controlled dosing, and interactions with food ingredients and drugs. The search for new antithrombotics with an improved safety/efficacy profile led to the development of the direct oral thrombin-inhibitor ximelagatran. It can be administered without routine monitoring of coagulation parameters and does not possess any of the previously mentioned limitations. The results from clinical phase II studies obtained so far are very encouraging. After completion of the clinical development program focussing on prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, on stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and on acute coronary syndromes, it is desirable to continue with investigations with regard to long-term prophylaxis in high risk surgery, in chronic peripheral artery disease, in patients with left ventricular thrombi, artificial heart valves, or thrombophilia, as an alternative anticoagulant in heparin induced thrombocytopenia and for prevention of thromboembolic complications in oncology. Because of the mitogenic effects of thrombin on the proliferation of tumour cells, additional experimental studies aiming at a potential inhibition of thrombin-triggered oncogenesis is of uttermost interest.

11914536|t|Altered food preference after cortical infarction: Korean style.
11914536|a|BACKGROUND: Altered food preference or preoccupation with certain food after stroke has been rarely described in the literature. METHODS: We report four Korean patients who developed altered food preference secondary to unilateral cortical infarction. RESULTS: Two patients showed preoccupation with meat such as Pulgogi or Kalbi (roast beef flavored with ingredients), which had not been their preference prior to the occurrence of stroke. All the patients became intolerant to the smell and taste of mackerel, and two disfavored hot Kimchi (cabbage salted with hot pepper). Quantitative taste assessment done in the patients revealed decreased taste perception in a variable pattern along with dysgeusia. Imaging studies showed that the region commonly involved was the frontal opercular area corresponding to the taste cortex. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that strokes involving the taste cortex may produce altered food preference associated with decreased taste sensation.

14523736|t|Activity-dependent factors affecting poststroke functional outcomes.
14523736|a|Over the last several years, there has been increasing recognition of the potential for central nervous system (CNS) recovery after brain damage. One commonality across the recovery and brain plasticity literature is that practice induces plastic, dynamic changes in the CNS. However, more than simply repetition, it is the manipulation of specific practice variables that appears to drive these dynamic processes in the CNS. The experimental manipulations used in the studies on neuroplasticity largely derive from the concept that in the undamaged or healthy brain neuronal connections and cortical maps are continuously remodeled by experience and by the performance of specific, intensive, and complex movements used to solve motor problems and attain goals. Intervention designed to promote recovery rather than compensation after stroke would then manipulate these same practice variables that have consistently promoted behavioral recovery and neuroplasticity in laboratory settings. Three current intervention strategies that incorporate these practice variables are reviewed. Preliminary results provide evidence that manipulation of task intensity and specificity and the sensorimotor experience of the task training are the necessary ingredients for maximizing the tremendous potential for recovery in patients with stroke.

9823823|t|The efficacy of Ginkgo biloba on cognitive function in Alzheimer disease.
9823823|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of treatment with Ginkgo biloba extract on objective measures of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) based on formal review of the current literature. METHODS: An attempt was made to identify all English and non-English-language articles in which G. biloba extract was given to subjects with dementia or cognitive impairment. Inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis were (1) sufficiently characterized patients such that it was clearly stated there was a diagnosis of AD by either Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition, or National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria, or there was enough clinical detail to determine this by our review; (2) clearly stated study exclusion criteria, ie, those studies that did not have stated exclusions for depression, other neurologic disease, and central nervous system-active medications were excluded; (3) use of standardized ginkgo extract in any stated dose; (4) randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind study design; (5) at least 1 outcome measure was an objective assessment of cognitive function; and (6) sufficient statistical information to allow for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of more than 50 articles identified, the overwhelming majority did not meet inclusion criteria, primarily because of lack of clear diagnoses of dementia and AD. Only 4 studies met all inclusion criteria. In total there were 212 subjects in each of the placebo and ginkgo treatment groups. Overall there was a significant effect size of 0.40 (P<.0001). This modest effect size translated into a 3% difference in the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subtest. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a quantitative analysis of the literature there is a small but significant effect of 3- to 6-month treatment with 120 to 240 mg of G. biloba extract on objective measures of cognitive function in AD. The drug has not had significant adverse effects in formal clinical trials but there are 2 case reports of bleeding complications. In AD, there are limited and inconsistent data that preclude determining if there are effects on noncognitive behavioral and functional measures as well as on clinician's global rating scales. Further research in the area will need to determine if there are functional improvements and to determine the best dosage. Additional research will be needed to define which ingredients in the ginkgo extract are producing its effect in individuals with AD.

9666695|t|[Wine and heart].
9666695|a|Many epidemiological studies have shown that moderate alcohol intake, from 10 to 30 g of ethanol a day, decreases cardiovascular mortality from atherosclerotic ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke as compared to non-drinkers. This beneficial effect outweighs the risks of alcohol consumption in subgroups of people with a higher risk of atherosclerosis: the elderly, people with coronary risk factors and patients with previous coronary events. It has not been demonstrated that alcohol intake, even in moderate amounts, is beneficial for the general population, in particular, men under the age of 40 and women under 50, because it raises mortality due to other causes, especially injury, cirrhosis of the liver and some types of cancer, thereby outweighing the benefits for coronary artery disease. Thus, alcohol consumption should not be recommended as a prophylaxis for the general population. Guidelines on alcohol drinking habits--whether to continue, to start, to modify or to stop--must be given on an individual basis, taking into account the relative risks and benefits for each patient. The benefits of moderate alcohol consumption on the cardiovascular system seem to be exerted fundamentally through its effects on plasma lipoproteins, principally by raising high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and to a lesser degree, by decreasing low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. It appears to exert additional beneficial effects on the heart by decreasing platelet aggregability and by bringing about changes in the clotting-fibrinolysis system. Although there has been some debate about the relative superiority of different types of alcoholic beverages (wine, beer or hard liquor), and to a greater extent, about different types of wine, there is no current evidence of any kind of beneficial effect from other components of the beverage besides ethanol. Thus, it does not seem appropriate to recommend any particular type of alcoholic drink, except for sociocultural reasons. The added benefits from some components of different types of wine with a high antioxidant activity on plasma lipoproteins remain only an interesting hypothesis. Meanwhile, encouraging a healthy diet, flavonoid rich and with a predominance of natural ingredients (fruit, legumes, cereals and seeds), in the general population should stop the current tendency of Southern European countries from abandoning the Mediterranean diet. Because of the multifactorial nature of coronary heart disease, it is necessary to remember that atherosclerotic risk reduction is achieved by behavior modification of multiple risk factors present in individual patients and in the general population. Therefore, guidelines regarding alcohol intake should always be linked to pertinent recommendations about other atherosclerotic risk factors.

15335551|t|Medico-legal aspects of doping.
15335551|a|Abuse of anabolic steroids is an increasing problem not only among athletes but also body-builders and teenagers. A fast-developing black market has been established since the opening of the borders to eastern Europe. Medico-legal aspects of doping are addressed with particular reference to toxicology and pathology. Constituents of anabolic steroids bought on the black market were identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; the products did not contain the expected ingredients in 35% of cases. Long-term effects and fatalities because of anabolic steroid abuse are reported here based on our own case material and a literature review. In our own cases, severe cardiovascular side-effects developed after long-term abuse of Dianabol (methandrostenolone) and Oral-Turinabol (chlordehydromethyltestosterone), i.e. myocardial infarction, stroke, organomegaly and/or severe atherosclerosis. The pathogenesis of cardiovascular complications (cardiotoxic effect, risk of atherosclerosis, thrombogenic risk) is discussed based on the available literature reports following fatal outcome after the abuse of anabolic steroids.

8892167|t|Interrelationships of food, nutrition, diet and health: the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges White Paper.
8892167|a|Nutrition and food science have each enhanced the development of an abundant, nutritious, safe food supply. A healthy diet should contain all of the required nutrients and sufficient calories to balance energy expenditure and provide for growth and maintenance throughout the life cycle. Importantly, dietary factors are associated with 5 of the 10 leading causes of death, including coronary heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. National health care expenditures for 1990 totaled $666 billion of which 30% are related to inappropriate diet. Identification of external factors that contribute to premature death would aid preventive efforts, improve the quality of life, and reduce health care costs. Even though genetic predisposition increases susceptible people's risk for many of these chronic diseases, these conditions may be diminished or prevented by improvements in the American diet. Each stage of the life cycle has specific nutrient needs. Throughout infancy, childhood and adolescence nutrients are required to meet the growth processes as well as cognitive function. During pregnancy nutrients are required for both mother and developing infant needs. Adult nutrition focuses on tissue maintenance, nutrient and energy needs, and disease prevention. As the population of elderly increase in number and greater age, nutritional needs must be met to minimize certain disease states and assure the quality of life. Nutrition associated health risks have been identified for coronary heart disease, cancer and diabetes mellitus. Recommendations for each includes a decrease in dietary fat, awareness of caloric intake and enhancement of nutrient density including an increase in fruit and vegetables. These recommendations also impact obesity and diminish the compounding of other disease states affected by excessive body weight. Calcium intake at early ages affects development of bone density and manifestation of osteoporosis. Current gaps in knowledge are also identified that could improve health. Numerous nutrients are being examined for their regulation of specific gene expressions and in the processes of transcription and translation. To offer food products with greater nutrient density or improved functional health ingredients, modification of existing foods is needed to assure an improved diet. Policies to improve health require integration of nutrition needs with economic growth and development, agriculture and food production, processing, marketing, health care and education, and includes changing life styles and food choices. Increased research support is required to achieve national health goals with emphasis on nutrition and food sciences. Education methods must be improved to better inform consumers, to encourage food producers and manufactures to produce healthier foods, to assure training of future professionals and to provide legislators with the basis to make informed decisions. Recommendations to CFERR are identified. Improved quality and availability of nutritious foods will result in a healthier, more productive population. A decrease in the occurrence and duration of chronic disease should diminish the cost of health care and allow these resources to further benefit the nation. International concerns about undernutrition include 780 million people who are malnourished, lacking sufficient food to meet their basic nutritional needs for protein and energy, and 2 billion people who subsist on diets lacking essential nutrients needed for growth, development and physiological maintenance. National concerns about undernutrition exist based on incomplete data identified by indices of hunger and characterized by an increased demand for food assistance for women, children and the elderly. Major health problems in the US impacted by diet and nutrition include coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, some types of cancer, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypert

16350574|t|Visceral obesity: a "civilization syndrome".
16350574|a|The controversial question of the relationship between obesity and disease has been considerably clearer after the demonstration in several prospective, epidemiological studies that the subgroup of central, visceral obesity is particularly prone to develop cardiovascular disease, stroke, and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Visceral obesity is associated with multiple central endocrine aberrations. The hypothalamo-adrenal axis is apparently sensitive to stimuli, sex steroid hormone secretion blunted, and hyperandrogenicity is found in women. In addition, there seem to be signs of central dysfunctions in the regulation of hemodynamic factors after stress, and growth hormone secretion appears to be particularly blunted. Several of these endocrine abnormalities are associated with insulin resistance, particularly glycogen synthesis in muscle. Fiber composition with low type I/type II ratio might be secondary to the prevailing hyperinsulinemia, but low capillary density in muscle may well be of importance. In combination with elevated turn-over of free fatty acids (FFA) this will probably provide powerful mechanisms whereby insulin resistance is created. Portal FFA, from the highly lipolytic visceral depots may, in addition, affect hepatic metabolism to induce increased gluconeogenesis, production of very low density lipoproteins as well as to perhaps inhibit clearance of insulin. By these mechanisms a Metabolic Syndrome Visceral adipocytes seem to have a high density of several steroid hormone receptors, directing steroid hormone effects particularly to these depots. The net effect of cortisol is apparently a stimulation of lipid storage, with opposing effects of sex steroid hormones which also facilitate lipid mobilization, regulations most often found at the gene transcription level. Growth hormone inhibits cortisol effects on lipid accumulation, and amplifies the lipid mobilizing effects of steroid hormones. The combined perturbations of hormonal secretions will therefore probably direct triglycerides toward visceral depots. Circulatory and nervous regulatory mechanisms require, however, more attention. The multiple central endocrine and nervous aberrations of visceral obesity suggest neuroendocrine dysregulations, and have features characteristic of the hypothalamic arousal seen after certain types of stress, alcohol intake, and smoking. Such factors can be traced to subjects with visceral fat accumulation. Standardized stress, eliciting a "defeat reaction" in primates is followed by an apparently identical syndrome. This integrated picture of the multiple symptoms of visceral obesity is based on epidemiological, clinical, experimental, cellular, and molecular evidence. The ingredients of positive energy balance, including physical inactivity, stress, smoking, and alcohol consumption are frequent features of modern, urbanized society. Visceral obesity may therefore be an expression of a "Civilization Syndrome."

2200264|t|Adverse drug effects attributed to phenylpropanolamine: a review of 142 case reports.
2200264|a|Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) is contained in about 106 products, over half of which are available over-the-counter (OTC). Most are cough/cold remedies; nine are OTC diet aids. More than nine million Americans were using OTC diet aids in 1981, making PPA the fifth most used drug in the United States, responsible for over $200 million in revenues. The safety of PPA remains controversial. Although most controlled studies indicate minimal pressor effects with recommended doses, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) continue to be documented. Since 1965, 142 ADRs have been reported in 85 studies, 69% of these in North America. Many such cases may go unrecognized. About two thirds of all ADRs occurred in females and in patients under 30. Of ADRs attributed to legitimately sold PPA products, 85% occurred after consumption of OTC products versus only 15% after prescription drugs. The PPA product often contained combination ingredients, or PPA was consumed along with additional drugs. An overdose of PPA was taken in about a third of the cases. After ingestion of non-overdose amounts, 82% of the ADRs were severe. The most frequent side effects involved symptoms compatible with acute hypertension, with severe headache the most common complaint. Twenty-four intracranial hemorrhages, eight seizures, and eight deaths (most due to stroke) were associated with PPA ingestion. We have summarized these data in an effort to alert clinicians to the prevalence of usage of PPA products and the potential for adverse effects. In patients who present with elevated blood pressure or signs of acute hypertension, especially hypertensive encephalopathy of undetermined origin, we recommend inquiry about recent ingestion of PPA-containing diet aids and cough/cold products and suggest having such patients remain upright rather than supine.

12341244|t|What role do lipid levels play in managing OC patients?
12341244|a|PIP: 6 research physicians are interviewed about the actual clinical relationship between serum cholesterol levels, oral contraceptive (OC) use and cardiovascular disease. Many experts feel that available studies of OC-related serum lipid alterations are flawed by small sample size and lack of longitudinal followup. A Deakin University study may have falsified data and the Framingham study concentrated on men and postmenopausal women who were not taking oral contraceptives. Family histories of heart attack or stroke may be as effective an OC contraindication as expensive lipoprotein screening. Some doctors concur that OC manufacturers are overstressing the effects of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides in order to sell their pills. Doctors concluded that, since research is still inconclusive, the wisest clinical course of action is to prescribe pills that will have the least effect on lipid metabolism, such as those containin 0.5 mg of norethindrone or less, combined with 35 mcg ethinyl estadiol.

6481707|t|Pill formulations and their effect on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.
6481707|a|PIP: Recent data on oral contraceptives (OCs) employing new low-dose formulations appear to indicate that most of the previously reported metabolic effects are minimized, particularly when a product is neigher ovverly estrogenic nor progestational. Evidence suggests that elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the plasma are correlated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. Epidemiologic students have indicated a correlation between elevation of low denisty lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease, and a correlation between decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and arterial disease. Epidemiologic evidence seems to suggest that combination OCs are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, especially risks of venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke. There is some debate as to whether OCs themselves are an independent risk factor or whether they increase the effects of other risk factors. Women using combination OCs have been reported to have higher total serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, related primarily to the estrogen dose. While most of the earlier literature associated estrogens with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, recent studies have increasingly implicated the progestin component. Increasing potencies of progestin have been found to proportionally lower the HDL-cholesterol level. There is a positive association between the estrogen dose and HDL-cholesterol level. Among combination pill users, HDL levels gevverally depend on the relative amounts and potencies of both components. It is generally agreed that there are some high-risk women who should be carefully monitored while using the pill or who should not use it at all. Steroid type and dosage both play a role in affecting carbohydrate metabolism. Ethinyl estradiol (EE), the estrogen component in most OCs, does not seem to have the same biphasic effect on carbohydrate metaolism as most other estrogens. Most of the recent literature suggests that 19-norprogestins alter carbohydrate metabolism in a dose-related manner. The major problems in carbohydrate metabolism have been caused by high dose OCs and the progestin norgestrel. The recent literature confirms the advantages of the new low-dose compounds, with 1 study finding no adverse effects on carbohydrate metabolism and no significant change in plasma insulin levels with a dose of 35 mcg EE and .4-.5 mg norethindrone. The use of OCs in prediabetic and insulin-dependent diabetic women must be weighed against the dangers of pregnancy and the characteristics of the individual patients.

12310419|t|Current technology for abortion.
12310419|a|PIP: This discussion focuses on the presently available technology of abortion induction techniques, which, though recent scientific interest has been in abortifacient agents, still primarily consists of some variation on the ancient technique of forcible cervical dilatation and pregnancy extraction in the first trimester. With the advent of legal abortions in the United States, technology and expertise that will lower the already low rate of abortion-associated complications are of paramount importance. That abortion may be preferable to contraception as a fertility control measure is argued from the following 3 drawbacks of present means of contraception: 1) they are preventitive and must be used in advance of need; 2) they fail more frequently than is usually thought (e.g., 4% for birth control pills, 5% for IUDs, and from 17-21% for more conventional methods); and 3) they are associated, though rarely, with potentially fatal side effects such as heart attack, stroke, or infection (some also raise the incidence of pathological pregnancies). The article devotes itself to an overview of complications of induced abortions (the mortality for legal abortions is 1/100,000 vs. maternal mortality of 10/100,000 in the United States), and to discussions of appropriate evacuation procedures per gestational age. Instruments and techniques for menstrual regulation (uterine aspiration during first trimester), are discussed. Procedures and instrumentation required for standard vacuum aspiration are covered. Use of analgesics and anesthetics during abortion procedures comprises one topic, with especial focus on the use of curettage for midtrimester terminations. Midtrimester terminations by amnioinfusions of abortifacients (saline, urea, and prostaglandins, e.g.) are analyzed. And, in addition to discussing sequelae for each particular abortion type, a section is devoted to the sequelae of induced abortion for subsequent pregnancy. Though 100% effectiveness has not been achieved yet, today a procedure which is 98% effective, menstrual regulation with Karman cannula and 50-ml syringe, already exists and focus should be placed on training developing-nation practitioners to master this relatively simple, safe, effective, and inexpensive procedure.
