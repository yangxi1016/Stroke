31680944|t|Efficacy and Safety of NaoShuanTong Capsule in the Treatment of Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis.
31680944|a|Background: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide. The NaoShuanTong capsule (NSTC), a traditional Chinese patent medicine, has been extensively used in the treatment of stroke in China. However, the clinical efficacy and safety of this treatment has not been statistically and systematically verified by any comprehensive pooled analysis. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NSTC in the treatment of IS. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of NSTC in the treatment of IS conducted before September 2018 were retrieved from five databases, according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two investigators independently reviewed the included studies and extracted relevant data. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using criteria from the Cochrane Handbook, and analyzed using Review Manager 5.3 software. Results: Thirteen RCTs comprising a total of 1,360 participants were included in this study. NSTC was shown to significantly improve the overall response rate (OR = 3.04, 95% CI [1.76, 5.26], P < 0.00001), and neurological function (NSTC increased Modified Barthel Index (MD = 8.15, 95% CI [3.79, 12.52], P = 0.0005), Functional Independence Measure (MD = 29.61, 95% CI [10.11, 49.10], P = 0.003) and European Stroke Scale scores (MD = 8.51, 95% CI [7.00, 10.01], P = 0.03). In addition, NSTC significantly increased serum adiponectin level (MD = 0.66, 95% CI [0.23, 1.08], P = 0.002). Moreover, NSTC reduced atherosclerotic plaque area (MD = -2.24, 95% CI [-4.02, -0.46], P = 0.01) and intima-media thickness (MD = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.13, -0.05], P < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between NSTC treatment and conventional therapy with respect to Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (MD = 10.59, 95% CI [-1.78, 22.96], P = 0.09) or Crouse score (MD = -0.78, 95% CI [-1.79, -0.22], P = 0.13). Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis showed that NSTC exhibits efficacy in the treatment of cerebral infarction. NSTC can improve the overall response rate and neurological function, increase blood adiponectin, reduce neurological deficits, and decrease atherosclerotic plaque area.

31553733|t|Estimated stroke risk, yield, and number needed to screen for atrial fibrillation detected through single time screening: a multicountry patient-level meta-analysis of 141,220 screened individuals.
31553733|a|BACKGROUND: The precise age distribution and calculated stroke risk of screen-detected atrial fibrillation (AF) is not known. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the number needed to screen (NNS) to identify one treatable new AF case (NNS-Rx) (i.e., Class-1 oral anticoagulation [OAC] treatment recommendation) in each age stratum. If the NNS-Rx is known for each age stratum, precise cost-effectiveness and sensitivity simulations can be performed based on the age distribution of the population/region to be screened. Such calculations are required by national authorities and organisations responsible for health system budgets to determine the best age cutoffs for screening programs and decide whether programs of screening should be funded. Therefore, we aimed to determine the exact yield and calculated stroke-risk profile of screen-detected AF and NNS-Rx in 5-year age strata. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A systematic review of Medline, Pubmed, and Embase was performed (January 2007 to February 2018), and AF-SCREEN international collaboration members were contacted to identify additional studies. Twenty-four eligible studies were identified that performed a single time point screen for AF in a general ambulant population, including people ≥65 years. Authors from eligible studies were invited to collaborate and share patient-level data. Statistical analysis was performed using random effects logistic regression for AF detection rate, and Poisson regression modelling for CHA2DS2-VASc scores. Nineteen studies (14 countries from a mix of low- to middle- and high-income countries) collaborated, with 141,220 participants screened and 1,539 new AF cases. Pooled yield of screening was greater in males across all age strata. The age/sex-adjusted detection rate for screen-detected AF in ≥65-year-olds was 1.44% (95% CI, 1.13%-1.82%) and 0.41% (95% CI, 0.31%-0.53%) for <65-year-olds. New AF detection rate increased progressively with age from 0.34% (<60 years) to 2.73% (≥85 years). Neither the choice of screening methodology or device, the geographical region, nor the screening setting influenced the detection rate of AF. Mean CHA2DS2-VASc scores (n = 1,369) increased with age from 1.1 (<60 years) to 3.9 (≥85 years); 72% of ≥65 years had ≥1 additional stroke risk factor other than age/sex. All new AF ≥75 years and 66% between 65 and 74 years had a Class-1 OAC recommendation. The NNS-Rx is 83 for ≥65 years, 926 for 60-64 years; and 1,089 for <60 years. The main limitation of this study is there are insufficient data on sociodemographic variables of the populations and possible ascertainment biases to explain the variance in the samples. CONCLUSIONS: People with screen-detected AF are at elevated calculated stroke risk: above age 65, the majority have a Class-1 OAC recommendation for stroke prevention, and >70% have ≥1 additional stroke risk factor other than age/sex. Our data, based on the largest number of screen-detected AF collected to date, show the precise relationship between yield and estimated stroke risk profile with age, and strong dependence for NNS-RX on the age distribution of the population to be screened: essential information for precise cost-effectiveness calculations.

31461825|t|[Research progress on the treatment of cryptogenic stroke with patent foramen ovale].
29374291|t|Intracardiac echocardiography for percutaneous patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect occlusion.
29374291|a|BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) plays a unique role in transcatheter closure of atrial septal defects (ASD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO). However, problems such as the need for general anesthesia, possible trauma from endotracheal intubation, presence of "blind spots," and occasional inadequate imaging of some cardiac structures have necessitated better imaging techniques. Our study aimed to compare the findings of TEE during the initial diagnostic examination with those from intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) acquired during the interventional procedure. METHODS: A total of 65 patients in whom TEE was used for the diagnosis of ASD or PFO were included. Of these, 40 patients (61.5%) had ASD with significant left to right shunt and 25 (38.5%) patients had PFO associated with transient ischemic attack or stroke. ICE imaging was performed under local anesthesia in all patients to guide interatrial communication closure. RESULTS: ICE provided adequate views of the defects and surrounding structures during the various stages of device deployment. In eight patients (12.3%) an additional anatomical variation was detected. All patients had successful device implantation and were discharged 1 day after the procedure. CONCLUSION: ICE is a safe and high-quality imaging technique for guiding transcatheter ASD and PFO occlusion. Additionally, ICE can both facilitate device implantation and detect cardiac abnormalities that are not identified with TEE during the initial diagnostic investigation.

30910581|t|Angong Niuhuang Pill as adjuvant therapy for treating acute cerebral infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
30910581|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Angong Niuhuang Pill (ANP) is a well-known traditional Chinese patent medicine. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ANP as an adjuvant therapy in patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI) and acute intracerebral hemorrhage (AIH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a literature search in Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP database from their inceptions to April 2018. Randomized controlled trials evaluating ANP as an adjuvant therapy for acute stroke were selected. Risk ratio (RR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated between with and without ANP therapy. RESULTS: Eighteen trials involving 1,601 patients were identified and analyzed. Meta-analysis showed that ANP plus usual treatment significantly improved the total response rate in patients with ACI (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.14-1.41) and AIH (RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.14-1.38) compared with the usual treatment alone. Adjuvant treatment with ANP also significantly reduced the neurologic deficit score in patients with ACI (WMD -3.64; 95% CI -4.97 to - 2.31) and AIH (WMD -3.52; 95% CI -5.51 to -1.54). Moreover, ANP significantly improved the Glasgow Coma Scale in patients with ACI (WMD 1.18; 95% CI 0.79-1.56) and AIH (WMD 2.28; 95% CI 1.37-3.19). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant treatment with ANP appears to improve the total response rate and neurologic deficit score in patients with ACI and AIH. More well-designed trials are required due to the suboptimal methodological quality of the included trials.

31231259|t|Combination of Alprazolam and Bailemian Capsule Improves the Sleep Quality in Patients With Post-Stroke Insomnia: A Retrospective Study.
31231259|a|Insomnia is often ignored in the diagnosis and treatment of patients of stroke. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of alprazolam (ALP) combined with Bailemian capsule (BC, a traditional Chinese patent medicine) in the treatment of post-stroke insomnia (PSI). A total of 231 stroke patients involved in this retrospective study were treated with ALP, BC, or ALP + BC for 3 weeks. The quality of sleep was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and polysomnography (PSG), while self-care ability was monitored by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) before and after treatment. Compared with the baseline, the self-care ability of patients in each group was significantly improved after treatment (P < 0.01). The PSQI data showed a significant improvement in all patients in all of the subjective PSQI items and global score (P < 0.05). Notably, ALP + BC administration had a significantly greater effect on sleep latency, quality, disturbance, and efficiency, as well as daytime dysfunction and global PSQI than the use of ALP or BC alone (P < 0.05). The PSG data showed that ALP significantly improved the sleep efficiency and decreased the arousal times, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and sleep latency (P < 0.05), while BC significantly improved the sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and the duration of N3 (P < 0.05). Strikingly, ALP + BC achieved the effect of both ALP and BC (P < 0.05). Importantly, the effect of the combination of ALP and BC was greater than the use of ALP or BC alone, which was consistent with the result of PSQI. In conclusion, the sleep quality and self-care ability of patients with PSI were improved by ALP and BC, thereby supporting the potential advantages of ALP combined with BC in the treatment of patients with PSI.

30868832|t|[Regularity of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for same treatment for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases].
30868832|a|To explore the regularity of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) prescriptions for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases,the core drug groups with common therapeutic effects on cerebrovascular diseases represented by stroke and cardiovascular diseases represented by coronary artery disease were extracted,and their consistency and difference in the treatment of different diseases were analyzed.A total of 388 Chinese patent medicines were collected for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases,cardiovascular diseases and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases.The dominant and recessive patterns of Chinese patent medicines in clinical use were found by "frequency analysis","compatibility analysis" and "network analysis" respectively.According to the findings of the three parts,Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma,Chuanxiong Rhizoma,Carthami Flos and Astragali Radix have a high frequency of use in the treatment of brain disease,heart disease and both,with frequent combined medication.Data mining confirmed the core drug combinations for the treatment of cerebral and cardiac vascular diseases,so as to reveal the similarities and differences in the drug use of Chinese medicine for these diseases,and provide a basis for the rational use of traditional Chinese medicine in clinical practice.This analysis also defines a new direction for the future development of prescription combinations for different indications of cerebral and cardiac diseases.

29982215|t|Rationale and design for the detection and neurological impact of cerebrovascular events in non-cardiac surgery patients cohort evaluation (NeuroVISION) study: a prospective international cohort study.
29982215|a|OBJECTIVES: Covert stroke after non-cardiac surgery may have substantial impact on duration and quality of life. In non-surgical patients, covert stroke is more common than overt stroke and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Little is known about covert stroke after non-cardiac surgery.NeuroVISION is a multicentre, international, prospective cohort study that will characterise the association between perioperative acute covert stroke and postoperative cognitive function. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We are recruiting study participants from 12 tertiary care hospitals in 10 countries on 5 continents. PARTICIPANTS: We are enrolling patients ≥65 years of age, requiring hospital admission after non-cardiac surgery, who have an anticipated length of hospital stay of at least 2 days after elective non-cardiac surgery that occurs under general or neuraxial anaesthesia. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients are recruited before elective non-cardiac surgery, and their cognitive function is measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) instrument. After surgery, a brain MRI study is performed between postoperative days 2 and 9 to determine the presence of acute brain infarction. One year after surgery, the MoCA is used to assess postoperative cognitive function. Physicians and patients are blinded to the MRI study results until after the last patient follow-up visit to reduce outcome ascertainment bias.We will undertake a multivariable logistic regression analysis in which the dependent variable is the change in cognitive function 1 year after surgery, and the independent variables are acute perioperative covert stroke as well as other clinical variables that are associated with cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The NeuroVISION study will characterise the epidemiology of covert stroke and its clinical consequences. This will be the largest and the most comprehensive study of perioperative stroke after non-cardiac surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01980511; Pre-results.

30018549|t|Danhong Injection Reversed Cardiac Abnormality in Brain-Heart Syndrome via Local and Remote β-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling.
30018549|a|Ischemic brain injury impacts cardiac dysfunction depending on the part of the brain affected, with a manifestation of irregular blood pressure, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Generally called brain-heart syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine, few mechanistic understanding and treatment options are available at present. We hypothesize that considering the established efficacy for both ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI), Danhong injection (DHI), a multicomponent Chinese patent medicine, may have a dual pharmacological potential for treating the brain-heart syndrome caused by cerebral ischemic stroke through its multi-targeted mechanisms. We investigated the role of DHI in the setting of brain-heart syndrome and determined the mechanism by which it regulates this process. We induced Ischemia/Reperfusion in Wistar rats and administered intravenous dose of DHI twice daily for 14 days. We assessed the neurological state, infarct volume, CT scan, arterial blood pressure, heart rhythm, and the hemodynamics. We harvested the brain and heart tissues for immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. Our data show that DHI exerts potent anti-stroke effects (infarct volume reduction: ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. vehicle. Neurological deficit correction: ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. vehicle), and effectively reversed the abnormal arterial pressure (∗p < 0.05 vs. vehicle) and heart rhythm (∗∗p < 0.01 vs. vehicle). The phenotype of this brain-heart syndrome is strikingly similar to those of MI model. Quantitative assessment of hemodynamic in cardiac functionality revealed a positive uniformity in the PV-loop after administration with DHI and valsartan in the latter. Immunohistochemistry and western blot results showed the inhibitory effect of DHI on the β-adrenergic pathway as well as protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) (∗∗p < 0.01 vs. model). Our data showed the underlying mechanisms of the brain-heart interaction and offer the first evidence that DHI targets the adrenergic pathway to modulate cardiac function in the setting of brain-heart syndrome. This study has made a novel discovery for proper application of the multi-target DHI and could serve as a therapeutic option in the setting of brain-heart syndrome.

26919833|t|Comparison of Aspirin and Naoxintong Capsule () with Adjusted-Dose Warfarin in Elderly Patients with High-Risk of Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation and Genetic Variants of Vitamin K Epoxide Reductase.
26919833|a|OBJECTIVE: To compared the therapeutic effect of a Chinese patent medicine Naoxintong Capsule (, NXT) and aspirin with adjusted-dose warfarin in Chinese elderly patients (over 65 years) with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and genetic variants of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), who are at high-risk of thromboembolism. METHODS: A total of 151 patients, with NVAF and AA genotype of VKORC1-1639 (a sensitive genotype to warfarin) and a CHA2DS2-VASc clinical risk score of 2 or above, were chosen for this study. Patients were randomized into two groups and orally treated with a combination of aspirin (100 mg/day) and NXT (1.6 g thrice a day) or adjusted-dose warfarin [international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0). The primary end points including ischemic stroke and death as well as the secondary end points including hemorrhage events were followed up for at least 1 year. RESULTS: Baseline clinical data and the rates of primary end points were similar between groups. However, the rate of serious bleeding (secondary event) in the combination therapy group was lower than that in the adjusted-dose warfarin group (0% vs. 7.9%, odds ratio: 0.921, 95% confidence interval: 0.862-0.984, P=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin combined with NXT and warfarin displayed comparable rates of primary end point including ischemic stroke and all-cause death during the 1-year follow-up. However, as compared with warfarin, the combination therapy reduced the rate of serious bleeding. Therefore, aspirin combined with NXT might provide an alternative pharmacotherapy in preventing ischemic stroke for elderly patients with NAVF who cannot tolerate warfarin. (No. ChiCTR-TRC-13003596).

29458937|t|Chinese herbal medicine Dengzhan Shengmai capsule as adjunctive treatment for ischemic stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.
29458937|a|OBJECTIVE: The existing eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were critically appraised for the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine Dengzhan Shenmai for ischemic stroke. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis (CRD42016042914, http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO). METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched from inception to May 2016. Risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as effect estimates using RevMan 5.3. Meta-analysis was performed where data were available. A summary of finding table was generated by the GRADEpro (version 3.6). RESULTS: We identified 14 RCTs involving 5206 participants. Majority of the included trials were of high risk of bias in methodological quality. For acute ischemic stroke, adding DZSM capsule to conventional therapy achieved higher Barthel Index scores (MD 22.37, 95% CI 21.34-23.40), lower neurological function deficit scores (MD - 3.73, 95% CI -5.27 to -2.19) and lower recurrence rate (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.10, 0.46). For patients in their convalescence (or sequelae) stage of ischemic stroke, DZSM capsule was superior in improving quality of life (MD 28.8, 95% CI 7.10-50.50) and recurrence rate (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.99) compared to placebo. No trials reported serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: DZSM capsule appears to improve neurological function, quality of life, and reduce recurrence rate based on conventional therapy for ischemic stroke. DZSM capsule seems generally safe for clinical application. However, the findings of benefit are inconclusive due to generally weak evidence, and further large, rigorous trials are still warranted.

29619066|t|Efficacy and Safety of the Injection of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Puerarin for the Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 53 Randomized Controlled Trials.
29619066|a|Objective: The injection of the traditional Chinese patent medicine puerarin has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases such as angina pectoris or ischemic stroke. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of puerarin injection for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in seven medical databases from their inception until June 2017. 53 studies with RCTs, totaling 3284 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. The included studies were assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias and analyzed by Review Manager 5.3 software. Results: The meta-analysis showed that puerarin injection for the treatment of DPN was significantly better compared with the control group in terms of the total effective rate. The result showed that puerarin injection for the treatment of DPN can significantly increase the probability of sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) of the median and peroneal nerves. Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrated that puerarin injection may be more effective and safe for the treatment of DPN. However, further and higher quality RCTs are required to prove its efficacy and provide meaningful evidence for clinical treatment due to the poor methodological quality.

30271571|t|Patent foramen ovale closure versus medical therapy for stroke prevention: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
30271571|a|Background: Previous randomized trials on patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure versus medical therapy for stroke prevention were inconclusive. Recently, two new randomized trials and new findings from an extended follow-up of a previous trial have been published on this topic. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing PFO closure with medical therapy for stroke prevention. Methods: PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched until 16 th September 2017. The following search terms were used for PubMed: "patent foramen ovale" AND (stroke OR embolism) and "randomized" AND "Trial". For Cochrane Library, the following terms were used: "patent foramen ovale" AND "closure" AND (stroke OR embolism). Results: A total of 91 and 55 entries were retrieved from each database using our search strategy respectively, of which six studies on five trials met the inclusion criteria. This meta-analysis included 1829 patients in the PFO closure arm (mean age: 45.3 years; 54% male) and 1972 patients in the medical therapy arm (mean age: 45.1 years; 51% male). The median follow-up duration was 50 ± 30 months. When compared to medical therapy, PFO closure significantly reduced primary endpoint events with a risk ratio [RR] of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.44-0.83, P < 0.0001; I 2: 15%). It also reduced stroke (RR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.35-0.73, P < 0.0001; I 2: 32%) despite increasing the risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter (RR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.23-2.93, P < 0.01; I 2: 43%). However, it did not reduce transient ischemic accident events (0.75; 95% CI: 0.51-1.10, P = 0.14; I 2: 0%), all-cause bleeding (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.44-1.78, P = 0.74; I 2: 51%) or gastrointestinal complications (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.32-2.70, P = 0.88; I 2: 0%). Conclusions: PFO closure significantly reduces risk of stroke when compared to medical treatment and should therefore be considered for stroke prevention in PFO patients.

29245245|t|Therapeutic effect of Chinese herbal medicines for post stroke recovery: A traditional and network meta-analysis.
29245245|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is a condition with high morbidity and mortality, and 75% of stroke survivors lose their ability to work. Stroke is a burden to the family and society. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese herbal patent medicines in the treatment of patients after the acute phase of a stroke. METHODS: We searched the following databases through August 2016: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), China Science Periodical Database (CSPD), and China Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc) for studies that evaluated Chinese herbal patent medicines for post stroke recovery. A random-effect model was used to pool therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal patent medicines on stroke recovery. Network meta-analysis was used to rank the treatment for each Chinese herbal patent medicine. RESULTS: In our meta-analysis, we evaluated 28 trials that included 2780 patients. Chinese herbal patent medicines were effective in promoting recovery after stroke (OR, 3.03; 95% CI: 2.53-3.64; P < .001). Chinese herbal patent medicines significantly improved neurological function defect scores when compared with the controls (standard mean difference [SMD], -0.89; 95% CI, -1.44 to -0.35; P = .001). Chinese herbal patent medicines significantly improved the Barthel index (SMD, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-0.94; P < .001) and the Fugl-Meyer assessment scores (SMD, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34-0.86; P < .001). In the network analysis, MLC601, Shuxuetong, and BuchangNaoxintong were most likely to improve stroke recovery in patients without acupuncture. Additionally, Mailuoning, Xuesaitong, BuchangNaoxintong were the patented Chinese herbal medicines most likely to improve stroke recovery when combined with acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that the Chinese herbal patent medicines were effective for stroke recovery. The most effective treatments for stroke recovery were MLC601, Shuxuetong, and BuchangNaoxintong. However, to clarify the specific effective ingredients of Chinese herbal medicines, a well-designed study is warranted.

29122785|t|Naoxuekang, Xinnaoshutong and Xuesaitong capsules for treating stroke: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
29122785|a|INTRODUCTION: After stroke, hemiplegia, dysphasia and facial paralysis can manifest during the convalescent period. Currently, no Chinese patent medicine (CPM) is previously reported to cure each of these symptoms primarily, and thus, there are no relevant instructions for the use of CPM. This study presents a new approach based on comparative effectiveness research to distinguish the curative effects of three CPMs that are often used in stroke convalescence to determine the ideal medicine for the treatment of each symptom. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multicentre and double-blind clinical trial, stratified randomisation is used to group the patients according to their primary symptoms (hemiplegia, dysphasia and facial paralysis). Three strata will be enrolled, with 80 eligible participants included in each stratum. Each stratum will be randomly and equally divided into four groups, and each group will receive one of the following treatments: Naoxuekang, Xinnaoshutong (XNST), Xuesaitong (XST) or placebo. This study will include two stages: the initial treatment period (30 days) and a follow-up period (180 days). Three replicates for each data point will be completed during this trial. The first visit will occur on day 0 after enrolment, the second visit on day 30±2 and the third visit on day 210±5. The Delphi technique is adopted to achieve index weighting, which ensures that the evaluation outcome is patient oriented. The weighted index value will be computed as the final measurement index of the outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (registration number TJUTCM-EC20160007). The results will be offered for publication in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IOR-17010397). The date of registration was 11 January 2017.

28500428|t|A novel classification method for aid decision of traditional Chinese patent medicines for stroke treatment.
28500428|a|Traditional Chinese patent medicines are widely used to treat stroke because it has good efficacy in the clinical environment. However, because of the lack of knowledge on traditional Chinese patent medicines, many Western physicians, who are accountable for the majority of clinical prescriptions for such medicine, are confused with the use of traditional Chinese patent medicines. Therefore, the aid-decision method is critical and necessary to help Western physicians rationally use traditional Chinese patent medicines. In this paper, Manifold Ranking is employed to develop the aid-decision model of traditional Chinese patent medicines for stroke treatment. First, 115 stroke patients from three hospitals are recruited in the cross-sectional survey. Simultaneously, traditional Chinese physicians determine the traditional Chinese patent medicines appropriate for each patient. Second, particular indicators are explored to characterize the population feature of traditional Chinese patent medicines for stroke treatment. Moreover, these particular indicators can be easily obtained byWestern physicians and are feasible for widespread clinical application in the future. Third, the aid-decision model of traditional Chinese patent medicines for stroke treatment is constructed based on Manifold Ranking. Experimental results reveal that traditional Chinese patent medicines can be differentiated. Moreover, the proposed model can obtain high accuracy of aid decision.

28912713|t|Meta-Analysis for Clinical Evaluation of Xingnaojing Injection for the Treatment of Cerebral Infarction.
28912713|a|Objective: Xingnaojing injection (XNJ) is derived from An-Gong-Niu-Huang pill, a well-known traditional Chinese patent medicine, which is widely used for stroke. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of XNJ on cerebral infarction, an extensive meta-analysis was used. Methods: Six major electronic databases including the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Wanfang, the VIP medicine information system (VMIS) and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were examined to retrieve randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of XNJ in treating CI before November 26, 2016. Results: There were 53 randomized controlled trials with 4915 participants in this study. The results reflected that compared with the conventional therapy (CT) alone, XNJ could significantly improve the overall response rate (OR = 3.56, 95% CI [2.94, 4.32], P < 0.00001), and clinical symptom (including increasing activities of daily living (ADL, MD = 10.23, 95% CI [9.47, 10.99], P < 0.00001), and reduce infarction size (MD = -1.83, 95% CI [-2.49, -1.16], P < 0.00001)). However, there was no significant difference between the XNJ treatment and conventional therapy in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS, P = 0.32). Neurological deficit score demonstrated that XNJ could significantly reduce the score in two different evaluation criterions as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS, MD = -3.44, 95% CI [-4.52, -2.36], P < 0.00001), and the Chinese Stroke Scale (CSS, MD = -5.72, 95% CI [-6.94, -4.50], P < 0.00001). Additionally, serum MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly reduced by XNJ treatment compared with conventional therapy (MD = -11.24, 95% CI [-20.83, -1.65], P = 0.02; MD = -25.08, 95% CI [-35.49, -14.67], P < 0.00001, respectively). Moreover, XNJ was able to improve hemorrheology in reducing whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, and hematocrit (MD = -1.44, 95% CI [-2.18, 0.70], P = 0.001; MD = -0.22, 95% CI [-0.37, -0.07], P = 0.003; MD = -3.63, 95% CI [-6.23, -1.03], P = 0.006, respectively). The therapeutic efficacy of XNJ was found associated with improving hemodynamics (increasing peak-flow rate, and average velocity) (MD = 12.66, 95% CI [10.50, 14.81], P < 0.00001; MD = 9.90, 95% CI [8.63, 11.17], P < 0.00001). XNJ was also related to reducing cholesterol and triglyceride (MD = -1.06, 95% CI [-1.21, -0.92], P < 0.00001; MD = -1.05, 95% CI [-1.12, -0.97], P < 0.00001). Conclusion: Despite the sample size and the poor quality of the included studies of this review, the results of the research showed that XNJ might be a beneficial therapeutic method for the treatment of cerebral infarction.

28994524|t|[Clinical value evaluation of Chinese herbal formula in context of multi-omics network].
28994524|a|Clinical value evaluation is the key issue to solve the problems such as high repetition rate, fuzzy clinical positioning, broad indications and unclear clinical values in Chinese herbal formula(Chinese patent medicine). By analyzing the challenges and opportunities of Chinese herbal formula in clinical value evaluation, this paper introduced a strategy of multi-omic network analysis. Through comparative analysis of three stroke treatment formulas, we suggested their different characteristic advantages for variant symptoms or phenotypes of stroke, which may provide reference for rational clinical choice. Such multi-omic network analysis strategy may open a unique angle of view for clinical evaluation and comparison of Chinese herbal formula.

27868379|t|Qualitative and quantitative analysis of multiple components for quality control of Deng-Zhan-Sheng-Mai capsules by ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method coupled with chemometrics.
27868379|a|Deng-Zhan-Sheng-Mai capsules are a well-known traditional Chinese patent medicine that was developed in China for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Its quality control focuses on Erigerontis Herba but ignores the contributions of Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus, and Ophiopogonis Radix. To improve the quality standards for this medicine, this work reports the application of a systematic ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method coupled with chemometrics. Three qualitative and quantitative parameters are established for the evaluation of quality: chemical profiling, the relationship between the contents of 18 compounds and the antioxidant activity, and chemometric analysis. A total of 55 compounds, including 20 phenolic acids, 10 flavonoids, 15 saponins, and 10 lignans, were identified. The method for the quantitative determination of the aforementioned 18 compounds was validated. The limit of quantification ranged from 0.13 to 9.60 ng/mL. The overall recoveries ranged from 95.31 to 103.54%. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were applied to the data of 18 components in ten batches of samples. Nine compounds, including scutellarin, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Re, ginsenoside Rg1, ophiopogonin D, schisandrin, and schisandrol B, are suggested as chemical markers for evaluating the quality.

28243308|t|Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.
28243308|a|Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, which is related to many cardiac and cerebral vascular diseases, especially stroke. It can therefore increase cardiovascular mortality and all-cause death. The current treatments of AF remain to be western drugs and radiofrequency ablation which are limited by the tolerance of patients, adverse side effects, and high recurrence rate, especially for the elderly. On the contrary, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with long history of use involves various treatment methods, including Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) or bioactive ingredients, Chinese patent medicines, acupuncture, Qigong, and Tai Chi Chuan. With more and more researches reported, the active roles of TCM in AF management have been discovered. Then it is likely that TCM would be effective preventive means and valuable additional remedy for AF. The potential mechanisms further found by numerous experimental studies showed the distinct characteristics of TCM. Some CHMs or bioactive ingredients are atrial-selective, while others are multichannel and multifunctional. Therefore, in this review we summarized the treatment strategies reported in TCM, with the purpose of providing novel ideas and directions for AF management.

27015174|t|Traditional Chinese Patent Medicine for Acute Ischemic Stroke: An Overview of Systematic Reviews Based on the GRADE Approach.
27015174|a|The aim of the study is to conduct an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) to provide a contemporary review of the evidence for delivery of Traditional Chinese Patent Medicine (TCPMs) for patients with acute ischemic stroke.SRs were assessed for quality using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the Oxman-Guyatt Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire (OQAQ). We assessed the quality of the evidence of high methodological quality (an AMSTAR score ≥9 or an OQAQ score ≥7) for reported outcomes using the GRADE (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.(1) Dan Shen agents: tiny trends toward the improvement in different neurological outcomes (RR = 1.16, 1.10, 1.23, 1.08, 1.12); (2) Mailuoning: a tiny trend toward improvement in the neurological outcome (RR = 1.18); (3) Ginkgo biloba: tiny trends toward improvement in the neurological outcome (RR = 1.18, MD = 0.81); (4) Dengzhanhua: a tiny trend toward an improvement in neurological (RR = 1.23); (5) Acanthopanax: a small positive (RR = 1.17, 1.31) result on neurological improvement reported; (6) Chuanxiong-type preparations: neurological functional improved (MD = 2.90);(7) Puerarin: no better effect on the rate of death or disability (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.35-1.87); (8) Milk vetch: no better effect on the rate of death (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.11-2.83);(9) Qingkailing: rate of death reduced (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.11-2.83). Limitations in the methodological quality of the RCTs, inconsistency and imprecision led to downgrading of the quality of the evidence, which varied by review and by outcome. Consequently, there are currently only weak evidences to support those TCPMs.The 9 TCPMs may be effective in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, as the GRADE approach indicated a weak recommendation for those TCPMs' usage.

27245023|t|[Complex network analysis on dynamic change regularity of combining use of Chinese and western medicine in 27,678 cases with ischemic stroke in acute phase].
27245023|a|The acute phase of ischemic stroke patients are often treated with both Chinese patent medicine:and western medicine therapies in clinical practice. This research included 27,678 cases of the acute phase of ischemic stroke came from 14 3A level hospitals. We collected data from patients with ischemic stroke who used both Chinese patent medicine and western medicine and were hopitalized within 14 days from hospital information system (HIS). Constructing complex network of Chinese patent medicine and western medicine were found to show scale-free network. Hierarchical structure of the core algorithm was used to analyze the characteristics of combined core Chinese patent medicine and western medicine in admission condition of "acute", "critically", and "general" of ischemic stroke acute phase patient within one day, 2-3 days, 4-7 days and 8-14 days. We found that the core Chinese patent medicine mainly used for activate blood and resolve stasis medicine, and phlegm eliminating brain refreshing medicine in all kinds of patients, but the phlegm eliminating brain refreshing medicine were used to reduce with time elapsing. The core western medicine mainly used for anti-platelet medicine, improve circulation medicine, neuroprotective medicine, anticoagulants medicine and dehydration medicine. The dehydration medicine as the core western medicine for critically patients within 14 days, but the patients for general admission as core western medicine within 3 days. The neuroprotective medicine was used to decreases after 7 days in hospital. Combination of Chinese patent medicine and western medicine were mainly for neuroprotective medicine + activate blood and resolve stasis medicine, and anti-platelet medicine + activate blood and resolve stasis medicine, and improve circulation medicine + activate blood and resolve stasis medicine. The phlegm eliminating brain refreshing medicine was mainly combined with neuroprotective medicine by urgent and general admission condition patients, and it was more combined with dehydration medicine by critically admission condition patients. This research found that the dynamic characteristics for the combination of Chinese patent medicine and western medicine of acute phase of ischemic stroke patients by big data analytics and complex networks modeling, and provide basis for acute phase of ischemic stroke patients, it provide basis for ischemic stroke treatment strategy making.

26359258|t|Spatiotemporal PET Imaging of Dynamic Metabolic Changes After Therapeutic Approaches of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells, Neuronal Stem Cells, and a Chinese Patent Medicine in Stroke.
26359258|a|This study aimed to use spatiotemporal PET imaging to investigate the dynamic metabolic changes after a combined therapeutic approach of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neuronal stem cells (NSCs), and Chinese patent medicine in a rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.METHODS: Cerebral ischemia was established by the middle cerebral artery occlusion approach. Thirty-six male rats were randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 groups: control phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Chinese patent medicine (Qing-kai-ling [QKL]), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), combination of iPSCs and QKL, neuronal stem cells (NSCs), and combination of NSCs and QKL. Serial (18)F-FDG small-animal PET imaging and neurofunctional tests were performed weekly. Autoradiographic imaging and immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analyses were performed at 4 wk after stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: Compared with the PBS control group, significantly higher (18)F-FDG accumulations in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction were observed in 5 treatment groups from weeks 1-4. Interestingly, the most intensive (18)F-FDG accumulation was found in the NSCs + QKL group at week 1 but in the iPSCs + QKL group at week 4. The neurofunctional scores in the 5 treatment groups were significantly higher than that of the PBS group from week 3 to 4. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the PET imaging findings and neurofunctional recovery (P < 0.05) or glucose transporter-1 expression (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies found that transplanted iPSCs survived and migrated to the ischemic region and expressed protein markers for cells of interest. CONCLUSION: Spatiotemporal PET imaging with (18)F-FDG demonstrated dynamic metabolic and functional recovery after iPSCs or NSCs combined with QKL in a rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. iPSCs or NSCs combined with Chinese medicine QKL seemed to be a better therapeutic approach than these stem cells used individually.

In this study we applied a gene expression data and connectivity map (CMAP) based approach to study action mechanisms of a Chinese medicine Xuesaitong injection (XST) on preventing cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. XST is a standardized patent Chinese medicine of Panax notoginseng roots and it has long been used for the effective prevention and treatment of stroke in China. However, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying its effects against ischemic stroke. We first evaluated the effect of XST against ischemic stroke in an ischemia-reperfusion rat animal model and dissected its mechanisms based on gene expression data of injured brain. The results showed that treatment with XST significantly attenuated infarct area and histological damage. Based upon pathway analysis and the CMAP query of microarray data, anti-inflammatory response and anti-platelet coagulation were found as the major mechanisms of XST against stroke, which were further validated in vitro and with pharmacological assays of serum. We demonstrated the feasibility of applying the combination of the microarray with the CMAP in identifying mechanisms of Chinese medicine.

25749902|t|Ginkgo Biloba extract for angina pectoris: a systematic review.
25749902|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ginkgo Biloba extract for patients with angina pectoris according to the available evidence. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for all of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of angina pectoris treatments with Ginkgo Biloba extract, either alone or combined with routine Western medicine (RWM), and controlled by untreated, placebo, Chinese patent medicine, or RWM treatment. The RCTs were retrieved from the following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete, Springer, Elsevier, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Wanfang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database, China Biology Medicine (CBM), Chinese Medical Citation Index (CMCI), from the earliest database records to December 2012. No language restriction was applied. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. RevMan 5.1.0 provided by Cochrane Collaboration The data were analysed by using. RESULTS: A total of 23 RCTs (involving 2,529 patients) were included and the methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. Ginkgo Biloba extract with RWM was more effective in angina relief and electrocardiogram improvement than RWM alone. Reported adverse events included epigastric discomfort, nausea, gastrointestinal reaction, and bitter taste. CONCLUSIONS: Ginkgo Biloba extract may have beneficial effects on patients with angina pectoris, although the low quality of existing trials makes it difficult to draw a satisfactory conclusion. More rigorous, high quality clinical trials are needed to provide conclusive evidence.

25360841|t|Effects and Perspectives of Chinese Patent Medicines for Tonifying Qi and Promoting Blood Circulation on Patients with Cerebral Infarction.
25360841|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stroke is a disease with high morbidity, disability, and fatality. Since ischemic stroke is the most common kind of stroke, increasing attention has been paid to its prevention and treatment. Given the limitations of conventional medicine, there is growing interest in Chinese Medicine (CM), especially Chinese Patent Medicine (CPM) for its convenience and stability. Studies of CM show that Chinese Patent Medicines for Tonifying Qi and Promoting Blood Circulation (CPMs-TQPBC) are one of the most common and effective categories of all clinical CPMs in China. METHODS: This review investigated and summarized the randomized controlled trials (RCT) of CPMs-TQPBC combined with conventional interventions in the last 10 years. RESULTS: Trial results demonstrated the potential in reducing the endpoints and improving neurologic impairments, body movements, Barthel index, quality of life, and certain biomarkers. Furthermore, certain CM syndromes were alleviated with rare adverse events. Advantages of interventions combined with CPMs-TQPBC for patients with cerebral infarction were discovered. Compared with the Chinese patent medicines for promoting blood circulation (CPMs-PBC) alone, CPMs for both tonifying qi and promoting blood circulation exhibited noticeably better effects. The underlying reasons could be related to the improvement of microcirculation in the brain, protection against ischemic reperfusion injury, generation of neuroprotective factors, and inhibition of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Under the circumstances of qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome (QDBSS) (Qixu-Xueyu Zheng), CPMs- TQPBC showed a substantial difference. More trials focusing on specific patient groups should be carried out to corroborate and expand the findings.

25231888|t|Prolinamide derivatives as thrombin inhibitors for the treatment of thrombin-mediated diseases: a patent evaluation of US2013296245.
25231888|a|INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic disorders can lead to deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. Thrombin plays a vital role in cascade reaction of blood coagulation, inhibition of the activity of thrombin can block the formation of thrombus and direct thrombin inhibitor has a prospect to overcome the limitations in application of the traditional anticoagulant drugs. AREAS COVERED: The current patent US2013296245 describes a series of prolinamide derivatives with formula (I) as thrombin inhibitors. These new compounds are defined to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acid and organic acid, and pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug where N-alkoxycarbonyl is protected or carboxylic acid is protected by ester. EXPERT OPINION: The patent used formamidine and its N-alkoxycarbonyl-protected derivatives as the P1 group; these groups were less basic compared with the traditional guanidine group, so their lipophilicity could be optimized to achieve oral absorption. Furthermore, these pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs where N-alkoxycarbonyl is protected or carboxylic acid is protected by ester could achieve prolonged half-life for a convenient once- or twice-daily oral dosing. These efforts gave a new hope and confidence to treat thrombotic disorders with selective and orally active thrombin inhibitors.

25098768|t|Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors: a patent review (2011 - 2013).
25098768|a|INTRODUCTION: The MMPs are involved in tissue remodeling. An imbalance between the inhibition and activation of MMPs results in excessive degradation of the extracellular matrix, which leads to some diseases including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, heart disease and neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke. In this review, recent advances in the research of MMP inhibitors are reviewed. AREAS COVERED: This updated review summarized new patents on MMP inhibitors within January 2011 - December 2013. EXPERT OPINION: This review gives the latest development in the area of MMP inhibitors, which aim to treat disease processes associated with the MMPs. Structure-based design techniques have been used successfully in the search of selective MMP inhibitors, and these inhibitors can also be derived from natural products. Furthermore, imaging 'in vivo' technologies have been developed in order to follow the drug distribution to the targeted tissues, and to quantify the drug efficiency.

25087603|t|Cost-effectiveness analysis of combined Chinese medicine and Western medicine for ischemic stroke patients.
25087603|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of combining Chinese medicine (CM) with Western medicine (WM) for ischemic stroke patients. METHODS: Hospitalization summary reports between 2006 and 2010 from eight hospitals in Beijing were used to analyze the length of stay (LOS), cost per stay (CPS), and outcomes at discharge. RESULTS: Among 12,009 patients (female, 36.44%; mean age, 69.98±13.06 years old), a substantial number of patients were treated by the WM_Chinese patent medicine (CPM)_Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) (38.90%); followed by the WM_CPM (32.55%), the WM (24.26%), and the WM_CHM (4.15%). With adjustment for confounding variables, LOS of the WM_CPM_CHM group was about 10 days longer than that of the WM group, and about 6 days longer than that of the WM_CPM group or the WM_CHM group (P<0.01); CPS of the WM_CPM_CHM group was United States dollar (USD) 1,288 more than that of the WM group, and about USD 600 more than that of the WM_CPM group or the WM_CHM group (P<0.01). Compared with the WM group, odd ratio (OR) of recovered and improved outcome of the WM_CPM_CHM group was the highest [OR: 12.76, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 9.23, 17.64, P<0.01], OR of death outcome of the WM_CPM_CHM group was the lowest (OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.12, P<0.01). There was no significant difference between LOS, CPS and OR of the WM_CPM group and those of the WM_CHM group (P>0.05). Cost/effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the WM_CPM_CHM group were robustly higher than those of the WM group. CONCLUSION: Compared with WM alone, supplementing CPM and CHM to WM provides significant health benefits of improving the chance of recovered and improved outcome, and reducing the death rate, at an expense of longer LOS and higher CPS.

24495982|t|Risk of stroke in patients with patent foramen ovale: an updated meta-analysis of observational studies.
24495982|a|BACKGROUND: Although patent foramen ovale (PFO) is considered to be associated with cryptogenic stroke (CS), there remains an ongoing disputation on this issue because of unstable results from randomized controlled trials. The aim of this study was to reassess the PFO effect on stroke through observational data. METHODS: An electronic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were finished. Only case-control studies and cohort studies in Chinese or English were included in the analysis. Then random-effected meta-analysis models were performed to assess the association between PFO and stroke. RESULTS: Twelve case-control studies and 6 cohort studies were eligible. Case-control studies showed strong association between PFO and CS (odds ratio [OR]: 2.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.06, 4.20; P < .001), but cohort studies failed to demonstrate a significant association (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.28, 95% CI: .91, 1.80; P = .155). Subgroup analysis revealed that the pooled OR decreased significantly when the region was limited to the United States (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.00, 2.32; P = .083). OR of studies that adjusted major confounders was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.22, 2.47; P = .119) and high-quality studies was 1.68 (95% CI: 1.14, 2.47; P = .072). For cohort studies, a weak statistical association was observed in using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) studies (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.01; P = .138) and follow-up years less than 4 years' studies (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.00, 2.09; P = .064). CONCLUSIONS: Although case-control studies still show a positive effect of PFO on stroke, the results of cohort challenged the credibility. Further trial data are needed to confirm the effect of PFO on stroke.

24525155|t|HTUPA as a new thrombolytic agent for acute myocardial infarction: a multicenter, randomized study.
24525155|a|BACKGROUND: It is necessary to develop a new thrombolytic agent which can be used by a single bolus at first aid sites to decrease the time to reperfusion in clinical practice. HTUPA, a genetically engineered new thrombolytic with a longer half-life, is well qualified. We aim to compare the thrombolytic efficacy and safety of human tissue urokinase type plasminogen activator (HTUPA) to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in Chinese patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: AMI patients (n=221) were randomized to rt-PA (a standard protocol) or HTUPA (25 mg bolus) treatment groups. All patients also received oral aspirin and intravenous heparin. Coronary angiography was performed 90 min after therapy initiation to determine infarct-related coronary artery (IRA) patency. Clinical outcomes and changes of clotting variables, heart rate, blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and electrocardiogram were evaluated. RESULTS: Patent IRA [thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 2 or 3] was observed in 77% of HTUPA-treated patients, compared to 76% of rt-PA-treated patients (P=0.76). TIMI grade 3 patency rates were 52% and 44% in the HTUPA and rt-PA groups, respectively (P=0.37). The total patency rate was 77% (86/111 patients) in the HTUPA group and 73% (80/110 patients) in the rt-PA group (P=0.41). Adverse events were infrequent in both groups, and no significant differences were detected in mortality, re-occlusion rate, revascularization rate, adverse effects, clotting index, LVEF, or electrocardiogram between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous HTUPA had a safe and efficacious profile as good as rt-PA in patients with AMI.

24707306|t|Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of xingnaojing treatment for stroke.
24707306|a|Objective. Xingnaojing injection (XNJ) is a well-known traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM) for stroke. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of XNJ for stroke including ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Methods. An extensive search was performed within using eight databases up to November 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on XNJ for treatment of stroke were collected. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and meta-analysis were conducted according to the Cochrane standards, and RevMan5.0 was used for meta-analysis. Results. This review included 13 RCTs and a total of 1,514 subjects. The overall methodological quality was poor. The meta-analysis showed that XNJ combined with conventional treatment was more effective for total efficacy, neurological deficit improvement, and reduction of TNF- α levels compared with those of conventional treatment alone. Three trials reported adverse events, of these one trial reported mild impairment of kidney and liver function, whereas the other two studies failed to report specific adverse events. Conclusion. Despite the limitations of this review, we suggest that XNJ in combination with conventional medicines might be beneficial for the treatment of stroke. Currently there are various methodological problems in the studies. Therefore, high-quality, large-scale RCTs are urgently needed.

23890879|t|Percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale for cryptogenic stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
23890879|a|BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate on the role of percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in preventing recurrent ischemic events in patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO. We systematically reviewed the latest randomized data on the efficacy and safety of percutaneous PFO closure in patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched in April 2013 for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Primary outcome measures included: (i) stroke; (ii) transient ischemic attack (TIA); and (iii) all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and bleeding. RESULTS: We included a total of three RCTs randomizing 2303 participants. The intervention groups used either the STARFlex® Septal Closure System (one trial, n = 447) or the AMPLATZER™ PFO Occluder (two trials, n = 703). Control arms (n = 1153) used medical treatment composing of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. There were no significant differences between groups in the analyses of stroke (odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-1.20, P = 0.17), TIA (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.45-1.32, P = 0.35), all-cause mortality (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.23-1.85, P=0.42) or bleeding (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.47-4.42, P = 0.53). Percutaneous PFO closure was associated with a significantly higher incidence of new-onset AF as compared to medical therapy (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.44-9.87, P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Currently-available randomized data do not support the use of percutaneous PFO closure for secondary stroke prevention in patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO. An updated meta-analysis including further data from ongoing RCTs is warranted.

23363717|t|[One-stop hybrid cardiac surgery for adults with complex heart disease].
23363717|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and security of one-stop hybrid cardiac surgery for the treatment of adult patients with complex heart disease. METHODS: From November 2011 to March 2012, a total of 5 patients [4 male, mean age: (58.8 ± 14.7) years] underwent one-stop hybrid approach in the hybrid operating room. Two patients suffered from multi-coronary lesions, 2 patients were diagnosed with both valvular heart disease and coronary disease, and another 1 patient had valve disease and congenital heart disease (patent ductus arteriosus). Minimally invasive cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting for the left anterior descending or valvular surgery) and percutaneous intervention were performed in an enhanced operative unit. The efficacy and security of one-stop hybrid cardiac surgery were evaluated after the procedure. RESULTS: The one-stop hybrid procedure was successful in all patients. Left internal mammary artery grafts were unobstructed. A total of 6 non-left anterior descending coronary lesions were treated by percutaneous coronary intervention and 6 drug-eluting stents were implanted. There was no death, perioperative myocardial infarction, heart failure, prosthetic valve dysfunction, respiratory failure, stroke or repeat surgery during the procedure period. All patients remained free from angina, prosthetic valve dysfunction and patent ductus arteriosus recanalisation during the 3.2 months (rang 1 to 5 months) follow-up period. CONCLUSION: One-stop hybrid cardiac surgery provides a reasonable, feasible and safe alternative for treating adult patients with complex heart disease.

22855032|t|Several considerations in using traditional Chinese patent medicine for cerebral infarction.
22855032|a|Nowadays, a great number of traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM) are used more and more widely to treat cerebral infarction in China. When great attention is paid to using TCPM in the real world, several problems can be identified: ignoring the Chinese medicine (CM) therapeutic principle based on syndrome differentiation, a lack of appropriate dosage and usage based on individual patient conditions, and a shortage of evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Furthermore, in terms of evaluation of the TCPM effectiveness, few comprehensive criteria and evaluation methods recognized by the international community exist. This article addresses some opinions regarding the above mentioned problems.

22675376|t|Chinese medicine injection qingkailing for treatment of acute ischemia stroke: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
22675376|a|Qingkailing (QKL) injection was a famous traditional Chinese patent medicine, which was extensively used to treat the acute stages of cerebrovascular disease. The aim of this study was to assess the quantity, quality and overall strength of the evidence on QKL in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Methods. An extensive search was performed within MEDLINE, Cochrane, CNKI, Vip and Wan-Fang up to November 2011. Randomized controlled trails (RCTs) on QKL for treatment of acute stroke were collected, irrespective of languages. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards, and RevMan5 was used for data analysis. Results. 7 RCTs (545 patients) were included and the methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. The pooled results showed that QKL combined with conventional treatment was more effective in effect rate, and the score of MESSS and TNF-α level compared with conventional treatment alone, but there was no significant difference in mortality of two groups. Only one trial reported routine life status. There were four trials reported adverse events, and no obvious adverse event occurred in three trials while one reported adverse events described as eruption and dizziness.

21573109|t|Huangqi injection (a traditional Chinese patent medicine) for chronic heart failure: a systematic review.
21573109|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a global public health problem. Therefore, novel and effective drugs that show few side-effects are needed. Early literature studies indicated that Huangqi injection is one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese patent medicines for CHF in China. As a large number of clinical studies has been carried out and published, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Huangqi injection. Therefore, we carried out this systematic review under the support of the framework of the Joint Sino-Italian Laboratory (JoSIL). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Huangqi injection for CHF according to the available scientific knowledge. METHODS: An extensive search including PubMed, EMBASE, CBM, the Cochrane Library and Chinese literature databases was performed up to July 2008. Clinical trials regarding Huangqi injection for the treatment of CHF were searched for, irrespective of languages. The quality of each trial was assessed according to the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook 5.0, and RevMan 5.0 provided by the Cochrane Collaboration and STATA 9.2 were used for data analysis. RESULTS: After selection of 1,205 articles, 62 RCTs and quasi-RCTs conducted in China and published in Chinese journals were included in the review. The methodological quality of the trials was low. In most trials inclusion and exclusion criteria were not specified. Furthermore, only one study evaluated the outcomes for drug efficacy after an adequate period of time. For these reasons and because of the different baseline characteristics we did not conduct a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Although available studies are not adequate to draw a conclusion on the efficacy and safety of Huangqi injection (a traditional Chinese patent medicine), we hope that our work could provide useful experience on further studies on Huangqi injections. The overall level of TCM clinical research needs to be improved so that the efficacy of TCM can be evaluated by the international community and possibly some TCM can enter into the international market.

21094030|t|Radix/rhizoma notoginseng extract (sanchitongtshu) for ischemic stroke: a randomized controlled study.
21094030|a|Agents of sanchi have been widely used as a complementary medicine for stroke in China. Sanchitongshu is a new Chinese patent medicine extracted from sanchi which has stronger anti-platelet activity than other agents of sanchi. Our aim was to investigate the synergistic action of low dose of aspirin combined with sanchitongshu capsule in the treatment of patients with light and moderate ischemic stroke in acute and subacute stages. This was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in four hospitals in China from July 2004 to 2006. 140 patients of ischemic stroke in anterior cerebral circulation within 30 days of onset were enrolled. Participants were assigned either to receive aspirin (50mg per day) and sanchitongshu capsule (200mg three times a day) or aspirin (50mg per day) and placebo capsule. Low dose of aspirin combined with sanchitongshu capsule significantly ameliorated neurological deficit (increased score of ESS: t=-5.02, p<0.0001) and activities of daily living (increased score of BI: t=-2.4, p=0.0178) after treatment compared with aspirin alone. Adverse reaction which occurred equally in both arms, was light to moderate and disappeared without special treatment. Sanchitongshu capsule, as a complementary medicine to aspirin, was effective in improving outcomes after ischemic stroke. It was a safe drug in our trial.

17463317|t|Meta-analysis of traditional Chinese patent medicine for ischemic stroke.
17463317|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A large number of traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM) are widely used for ischemic stroke in China. The aim of this study was to systematically review the existing clinical evidence on TCPM for ischemic stroke. METHODS: We identified all TCPM that were listed in the Chinese National Essential Drug list of 2004 and those commonly used TCPM in current clinical practice for ischemic stroke. Fifty-nine TCPM were identified for further evaluation. We applied Cochrane systematic review methods. We searched for reports of randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials on any of the 59 TCPM for ischemic stroke comparing one TCPM with control. PRIMARY OUTCOMES included death or dependency at the end of follow-up (at least 3 months) and adverse events. Effects on neurological impairments were a secondary outcome. RESULTS: One-hundred ninety-one trials (19,338 patients) on 22 TCPM were available and included, of which 120 were definite or possible randomized controlled trials and 71 were controlled clinical trials. The methodological quality of included trials was generally "poor." Few trials reported methods of randomization. Three trials were randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: one trial on Puerarin and one trial on Shenmai injection assessed death or dependency at the end of long-term follow-up (at least 3 months) and found no statistically significant difference between 2 groups. The reported adverse events including allergic reaction, headache, nausea, diarrhea, bellyache, blood pressure change, and subcutaneous ecchymosis. Most of the adverse events were not severe. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: analysis of the secondary outcome, "marked improvement in neurological deficit," showed apparent benefits of about the same magnitude for all the TCPM studied. Of the 22 TCPM, 8 drugs (Milk vetch, Mailuoning, Ginkgo biloba, Ligustrazine, Danshen agents, Xuesetong, Puerarin, and Acanthopanax) had relatively more studies and patient numbers. CONCLUSIONS: There was insufficient good quality evidence on the effects of TCPM in ischemic stroke on the primary outcome (death or dependency). We considered the apparent benefit on neurological impairment was as likely to be attributable to bias from poor methodology as to a real treatment effect. However, because the agents assessed appeared potentially beneficial and nontoxic, further randomized controlled trials are justified. Eight drugs could be further research priorities.
