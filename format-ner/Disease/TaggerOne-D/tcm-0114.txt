31854225|t|XingNaoJing injection ameliorates cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury via SIRT1-mediated inflammatory response inhibition.
31854225|a|Context: XingNaoJing injection (XNJ), extracted from a traditional compound Chinese medicine Angong niuhuang pill, is well known for treating stroke in the clinic, but the specific effects and mechanisms remain unclear.Objective: We investigated the mechanistic basis for the protective effect of XNJ on cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.Materials and methods: Five groups of 10 SD rats underwent 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 h reperfusion. XNJ at 10 and 15 mL/kg was intraperitoneally administered 24 h before ischaemia and at the onset of reperfusion respectively. The silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor EX527 was intracerebroventricularly injected 0.5 h before reperfusion. Cerebral infarction size, neurological scores, morphological changes, and expression levels of inflammatory mediators and SIRT1 were measured. Furthermore, human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were subjected to 3 h oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 24 h reoxygenation to mimic cerebral I/R in vitro. EX527 pre-treatment occurred 1 h before OGD. SIRT1 and inflammatory mediator levels were analyzed.Results: Both XNJ doses significantly decreased cerebral infarct area (40.11% vs. 19.66% and 9.87%) and improved neurological scores and morphological changes. Inflammatory mediator levels were remarkably decreased in both model systems after XNJ treatment. XNJ also enhanced SIRT1 expression. Notably, the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 attenuated the XNJ-mediated decrease in inflammation in vivo and in vitro.Conclusions: XNJ improved cerebral I/R injury through inhibiting the inflammatory response via the SIRT1 pathway, which may be a useful target in treating cerebral I/R injury.

31908922|t|Overview of Cochrane reviews on Chinese herbal medicine for stroke.
31908922|a|Background: Stroke is a major health issue worldwide. Since Chinese herbal medicine is widely used for the treatment of stroke, there is a need to evaluate its efficacy as an alternative treatment option. The aim of this paper is to carry out an overview of Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of stroke by summarizing and evaluating all existing Cochrane reviews. Methods: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched from its inception date to August 2019 using "stroke" and "herbal medicine" or "traditional medicine" as search terms. For the methodological quality assessment of the Cochrane reviews, the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool was used. Results: Eight Cochrane reviews that evaluated the efficacy of herbal medicine for the treatment of stroke were included in this overview. There were 71 randomized controlled trials, with 5770 patients in total. The AMSTAR scores of the Cochrane reviews included in this study ranged from 9 to 11 with a mean score of 10. Three reviews met all the 11-item criteria of the AMSTAR. All reviews presented potential efficacy of herbal medicine for stroke treatment in terms of improvement of neurological deficit. Conclusion: This overview reveals the potential efficacy of herbal medicines for the treatment of stroke in terms of neurological deficit improvement. However, due to the high risk of bias in the reviews' studies, an affirmative conclusion for the recommendation of herbal medicine for clinical practice could not be drawn.

31775011|t|Longzhibu disease and its therapeutic effects by traditional Tibetan medicine: Ershi-wei Chenxiang pills.
31775011|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ershi-wei Chenxiang pills (ECP) or Aga Nixiu wan (ཨ་གར་ཉི་ཤུ།), composed of 20 Tibetan medicines, has the effect of promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis. As a common and frequent prescription used by traditional Tibetan medicine in clinical treatment of Longzhibu disease (cerebral ischemia sequelae), it has a significant effect. However, its anti-cerebral ischemia mechanism is still unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical components of ECP were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. SD rats were randomly divided into Sham, MCAO, Nim (20.00 mg/kg), and ECP (1.33 and 2.00 g/kg) groups, with 13 animals in each group. After 14 days of oral administration, we established a model of cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury by blocking the middle cerebral artery of rats. After 24 h of reperfusion injury, we evaluated the protective effect of ECP on ischemic brain by neural function score, TTC, H&E and Nissl staining. TUNEL fluorescence, western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the phenomenon of apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bax, Bcl-2, Cyto-c and activated Caspase-3. Furthermore, western blot, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were employed to detect CaMKⅡ, ATF4 and c-Jun gene and protein expression. RESULTS: ECP contains agarotetrol, eugenol, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, dehydrodiisoeugenol, hydroxysafflor yellow A, kaempferide, gallic acid, alantolactone, isoalantolactone, costunolide, dehydrocostus lactone, brucine, strychnine, echinacoside, bilirubin and cholic acid. Compared with MCAO group, ECP can significantly ameliorate the neurological deficit of cerebral ischemia in rats and reduce the volume of cerebral infarction. Pathological and Nissl staining results showed that ECP sharply inhibited the inflammatory infiltration injury of neurons and increased the activity of neurons in comparation with the MCAO group. TUNEL fluorescence apoptosis results confirmed that ECP obviously inhibited the apoptosis of neurons. Meanwhile, the results of immunohistochemistry and western blot demonstrated that EPC can dramatically inhibit the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Cyto-c and activated Caspase-3, while increase the level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In addition, compared with MCAO group, CaMK Ⅱ gene and protein expression were improved significantly by ECP administration. while, the expression of ATF4 and c-Jun genes and proteins were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study preliminarily demonstrated that the protective effect of ECP on ischemic brain is related to the improvement of neurological deficit, reducing the size of cerebral infarction, improving the activity of neurons, inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by regulating the protein expression of CaMKⅡ, ATF4 and c-Jun. However, further in vivo and in vitro investigations are still needed to clarify the underlying mechanism of ECP in treating cerebral ischemia sequelae.

31730888|t|Ligusticum chuanxiong exerts neuroprotection by promoting adult neurogenesis and inhibiting inflammation in the hippocampus of ME cerebral ischemia rats.
31730888|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cerebral ischemia, also known as stroke, can stimulate the proliferation and migration of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCS) in subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and subgranularzone of the dentate gyrus in the adult hippocampus as a defense response to damage. However, the proliferation of endogenous NSCS is insufficient for central nervous system repair. Neurogenesis and anti-neuroinflammation are two important aspects for neuroprotection. Rhizome Ligusticum chuanxiong (LC), the dried rhizomes of Ligusticum striatum DC., has been widely used to treat stroke for over hundreds of years in Traditional Chinese Medicine. PURPOSE: of the study: Previous reports on pharmacological mechanism of LC mainly focus on the cerebral blood flow and thrombolysis. We aim to explore whether LC provides neuroprotective effect by increasing neurogenesis and inhibiting the IL-1β, TNF-α and expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LC extract was delivered to microsphere-embolized (ME) cerebral ischemia Wister rats to examine its neuroprotection. Body weight, neurological scores, hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE), TUNEL assay were conducted for neurological damage. Neurogenesis was evaluated by assessing the expression of Doublecortin (DCX) and neurogenic differentiation1 (NeuroD1) through immunofluorescence staining. Western blot performed to measure the protein levels of growth associated protein-43(GAP-43), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). IL-1β and TNF-α was detected by Elisa. RESULTS: LC alleviated pathomorphological change and apoptosis of neurons in the hippocampus caused by ME surgery. Furthermore, LC significantly increased the DCX in the DG of adult rat hippocampus at 14 days after surgery. A significant upregulation of GAP-43 compared to the ME after LC was administered. Besides, LC decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, TNF-α) and protein level of GFAP. CONCLUSION: The finding suggested that LC had the ability to protect neurons by promoting the endogenous proliferation of neuroblast and production of neural differentiation factor in rats after ischemia injury. Meanwhile, LC can anti-neuroinflammation, which is important for the treatment of neuron injury. Accordingly, LC perhaps a promising medicine for neuron damage therapy after cerebral ischemia.

31678414|t|Ginkgo diterpene lactones inhibit cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced inflammatory response in astrocytes via TLR4/NF-κB pathway in rats.
31678414|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae) is a traditional Chinese medicine known to treating stroke and other cardio-cerebrovascular diseases for thousands of years in China. Ginkgo diterpene lactones (GDL) attracted much attention because of their neuroprotective properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: To uncover the effects of GDL, which consist of ginkgolide A (GA), ginkgolide B (GB), and ginkgolide K (GK), on ischemic stroke, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) models mimicking the process of ischemia/reperfusion in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Anticoagulant effects of GDL were investigated on platelet activating factor (PAF), arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation both in vivo and in vitro. We also evaluated the effects of GDL on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in primary cultured rats' astrocytes. Infarct size, neurological deficit score, and brain edema were measured at 72 h after MCAO. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to analyze neurons necrosis and astrocytes activation. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrotic factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real time PCR. The levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) were assessed by real time PCR or Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with MCAO/R rats, GDL significantly reduced infarct size and brain edema, improved neurological deficit score. Meanwhile, GDL suppressed platelet aggregation, astrocytes activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing, TLR4 mRNA expression and transfer of NF-κB from cytoplasm to nucleus. Furthermore, GDL alleviated OGD/R injury and LPS-induced inflammatory response in primary astrocytes, characterized by promoting cell viability, decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and inhibiting IL-1β and TNF-α releasing. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, GDL attenuate cerebral ischemic injury, inhibit platelet aggregation and astrocytes activation. The anti-inflammatory activity might be associated with the downregulation of TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway. Our present findings provide an innovative insight into the novel treatment of GDL in ischemic stroke therapy.

31571660|t|Neurological recovery and antioxidant effects of resveratrol in rats with spinal cord injury: a meta-analysis.
31571660|a|Objective: To critically assess the neurological recovery and antioxidant effects of resveratrol in rat models of spinal cord injury. Data sources: Using "spinal cord injury", "resveratrol" and "animal experiment" as the main search terms, all studies on the treatment of spinal cord injury in rats by resveratrol were searched for in PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Science Direct, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed databases by computer. The search was conducted from their inception date to April 2017. No language restriction was used in the literature search. Data selection: The methodological quality of each study was assessed by the initial Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable recommendations. Two reviewers independently selected studies according to the title, abstract and full text. The risk of bias in the included studies was also evaluated. Meta-analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.3 software. Outcome measures: Neurological function was assessed by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score, inclined plane score and Gale's motor function score. Molecular-biological analysis of antioxidative effects was conducted to determine superoxide dismutase levels, malondialdehyde levels, nitric oxide synthase activity, nitric oxide levels, xanthine oxidase and glutathione levels in spinal cord tissues. Results: The methodological quality of the 12 included studies was poor. The results of meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group, resveratrol significantly increased the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale scores after spinal cord injury (n = 300, mean difference (MD) = 3.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.10, 5.59], P < 0.0001). Compared with the control group, superoxide dismutase levels were significantly elevated (n = 138, standardized mean difference (SMD) = 5.22, 95% CI [2.98, 7.45], P < 0.00001), but malondialdehyde levels were significantly diminished (n = 84, SMD = -3.64, 95% CI [-5.84, -1.43], P = 0.001) in the spinal cord of the resveratrol treatment group. Conclusions: Resveratrol promoted neurological recovery and exerted antioxidative effects in rat models of spinal cord injury. The limited quality of the included studies reduces the application of this meta-analysis. Therefore, more high-quality studies are needed to provide more rigorous and objective evidence for the pre-clinical treatment of spinal cord injury.

31571650|t|Therapeutic potential of natural compounds from Chinese medicine in acute and subacute phases of ischemic stroke.
31571650|a|Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in adults worldwide, resulting in huge social and financial burdens. Extracts from herbs, especially those used in Chinese medicine, have emerged as new pharmaceuticals for stroke treatment. Here we review the evidence from preclinical studies investigating neuroprotective properties of Chinese medicinal compounds through their application in acute and subacute phases of ischemic stroke, and highlight potential mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects. It is noteworthy that many herbal compounds have been shown to target multiple mechanisms and in combinations may exert synergistic effects on signaling pathways, thereby attenuating multiple aspects of ischemic pathology. We conclude the paper with a general discussion of the prospects for novel natural compound-based regimens against stroke.

31689480|t|The efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines on acute coronary syndrome with renal insufficiency after percutaneous coronary intervention.
31689480|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Fufang Chuanxiong capsule consists of Angelica sinensis radix and Chuanxiong rhizome, which are used in the traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of coronary artery disease, and Xinyue capsule is composed of panax quinquefolius saponin extracted from leaves and stems of Panax quinquefolium L, which has the functions of anti-myocardial ischemia, improving myocardial energy metabolism and inhibiting apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. OBJECTIVE: To observe the role of Chinese herbal medicines in the cardiovascular outcome among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and renal insufficiency after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: The subjects came from the 5C trial (chictr.org number: chictr-trc-07000021), post-PCI patients suffered from ACS with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency (30 mL•min-1•1.73 m-2 < estimated glomerular filtration rate≤89 mL•min-1•1.73 m-2) included. The study population consisted of 215 subjects in the control group who were treated with western medicine standard therapy, and 211 subjects in the treatment group who were treated with Chinese herbal medicines (Fufang Chuanxiong Capsule and Xinyue Capsule) for 6 months on the basis of western medicine standard therapy. All were followed for 1 year. The primary endpoint included the composite of cardiac death, nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven revascularization. Secondary endpoint included the composite of stroke, congestive heart failure, and readmission for ACS. The serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were evaluated. RESULTS: After 1 year follow-up of two groups, there were 16 cases of primary endpoint in the control group and 6 cases of primary endpoint in the treatment group [absolute risk reduction (ARR): 0.046, 95%CI: 0.004-0.088; relative risk (RR): 0.38, 95%CI: 0.15-0.96, P = 0.040]. There were 15 cases of secondary endpoint in the control group and 5 cases of secondary endpoint in the treatment (ARR: 0.041, 95%CI: 0.006-0.086; RR: 0.34, 95%CI: 0.13-0.92, P = 0.033). The eGFR in the treatment group was significantly higher than that in the control group (75.19 ± 16.74 mL min-1·1.73 m-2 VS 72.03 ± 14.96 mL min-1·1.73 m-2, P < 0.05). The eGFR in the treatment group was significantly higher after the intervention with Chinese herbal medicines than that before intervention (72.27 ± 11.83 mL min-1·1.73 m-2 VS 75.19 ± 16.74 mL min-1·1.73 m-2, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Chinese herbal medicines plus western medicine standard therapy improved clinical outcomes in patients with ACS and mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. Additionally, this study also demonstrated Chinese herbal medicines were useful in deferring decline of renal function.

31751592|t|GAS5 knockdown ameliorates apoptosis and inflammatory response by modulating miR-26b-5p/Smad1 axis in cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury.
31751592|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) caused by cerebral arterial embolism remains the leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Cerebral ischemia / reperfusion (CI / R) injury is one of the common complications of ischemic stroke. Growth arrest specific transcript 5 (GAS5) has been found to be abnormally expressed in various tumors. However, the role and potential molecular mechanisms of GAS5 in CI / R-induced injury remain unknown. This study established a CI / R injury model in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that the expression of GAS5 was increased in CI / R rats, while miR-26b-5p expression was decreased. Besides, knockdown of GAS5 by siRNA (si-GAS5) reversed CI / R-induced apoptosis and inflammatory responses. Notably, bioinformatics analysis indicated that GAS5 competitively adsorbed miR-26b-5p, and the relationship was further confirmed by pull-down assay. In addition, miR-26b-5p overexpression reversed CI / R-induced apoptosis and inflammatory responses, whereas low expression of miR-26b-5p had the opposite effect. Moreover, TargetScan assay predicted that drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein 1 (Smad1) was a target of miR-26b-5p, and miR-26b-5p overexpression inhibited Smad1 expression. Conversely, Smad1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-26b-5p on CI / R-induced apoptosis and inflammatory responses in rats. Collectively, these results indicate that GAS5 knockdown can improve apoptosis and inflammatory responses by modulating the miR-26b-5p / Smad1 axis in CI / R rats.

31514228|t|KIF2 mediates the neuroprotection in cerebral ischaemia injury by affecting NF-κB pathway.
31514228|a|Stroke is the most common cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity and mortality around the world. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in nerve injury and cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) during cerebrovascular disease are still not completely clear. In the present study, we investigate the role of kinesin family member 2 (KIF2) in the neuroprotection after cerebral I/R injury. KIF2 was aberrantly expressed in the cerebral tissues from middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model in a time dependent manner. A similar changing pattern was found in the cultured hypoxic neurons as well as SK-N-SH cells in vitro. Compared to the control, KIF2 inhibition significantly increased the level of malonic dialdehyde (MDA), and reduced the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activity in cerebral tissues of MCAO rat model. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was also up-regulated after KIF2 siRNA knockdown in cultured hypoxic SK-N-SH cells. The apoptosis rates of hypoxic neurons and SK-N-SH cells as well as activated-caspase-3 level were obviously increased after KIF2 silencing. Furthermore, we found that the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway was involved in KIF2-mediated neuroprotection after cerebral I/R injury, and induced apoptosis of hypoxic SK-N-SH cells by KIF2 silencing could be attenuated by the specific inhibitor BAY11-7082 of NF-κB. In conclusion, we demonstrate that KIF2 could mediate the neuroprotection in cerebral I/R injury by inhibiting activation of NF-κB pathway. This might provide a novel therapeutic target for cerebral I/R injury.

31865785|t|Estimated Stroke-Free Survival of Folic Acid Therapy for Hypertensive Adults: Projection Based on the CSPPT.
31865785|a|The CSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial) demonstrated a significant risk reduction of first stroke in hypertensive patients treated with enalapril plus folic acid compared with those with enalapril alone, but the lifetime stroke-free survival associated with the treatment is unknown. By establishing adjusted models for competing risks and an age-based time scale using data from 19 053 participants of the CSPPT, we estimated lifetime incremental stroke-free survival for enalapril-folic acid versus enalapril alone. Compared with enalapril alone, the enalapril plus folic acid treatment projected a mean lifetime stroke-free survival gain of 1.75 months, with an interquartile range from 0.73 to 2.39 months and the maximum gain up to 12.95 months. Subgroup analyses showed greater gain in stroke-free survival in younger, male patients, those with lower baseline folate levels, higher baseline systolic blood pressure, higher baseline total cholesterol and blood glucose, and with MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) C677T CT or TT genotype. Overall, besides significant benefit in certain subgroups, enalapril plus folic acid treatment for hypertensive patients is associated with a modest gain in lifetime stroke-free survival, compared with enalapril alone.

31539363|t|Reconstituting neurovascular unit based on the close relations between neural stem cells and endothelial cells: an effective method to explore neurogenesis and angiogenesis.
31539363|a|The discovery of neural stem cells (NSCs) and their microenvironment, the NSC niche, brought new therapeutic strategies through neurogenesis and angiogenesis for stroke and most neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Based on the close links between NSCs and endothelial cells, the integration of neurogenesis and angiogenesis of the NSC niche is also a promising area to the neurovascular unit (NVU) modeling and is now offering a powerful tool to advance our understanding of the brain. In this review, critical aspects of the NVU and model systems are discussed. First, we briefly describe the interaction of each part in the NSC niche. Second, we introduce the co-culture system, microfluidic platforms, and stem cell-derived 3D reconstitution used in NVU modeling based on the close relations between NSCs and endothelial cells, and various characteristics of cell interactions in these systems are also described. Finally, we address the challenges in modeling the NVU that can potentially be overcome by employing strategies for advanced biomaterials and stem cell co-culture use. Based on these approaches, researchers will continue to develop predictable technologies to control the fate of stem cells, achieve accurate screening of drugs for the nervous system, and advance the clinical application of NVU models.

31924256|t|Acupuncture of fascia points to relieve hand spasm after stroke: a study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
31924256|a|BACKGROUND: The loss of functional ability of patients after stroke is mostly caused by dysfunction of the upper limbs, especially the hands. Hand functional exercise is the premise of alleviating hand dysfunction, and the relief of hand spasm is the basis of timely and effective hand functional exercise. Previous clinical observation have shown that fascial-point needling can effectively alleviate hand spasm immediately after stroke, but further evidence from large-sample studies is needed. The overall objective of this trial is to further evaluate the clinical efficacy of fascial-point acupuncture on hand spasm after stroke. METHODS/DESIGN: This multicenter randomized controlled trial will compare the efficacy of fascial-point acupuncture versus sham acupuncture and routine rehabilitation therapy in stroke patients with hand spasm. Patients will be randomized to undergo either the fascial-point acupuncture, the sham acupuncture or the control (routine rehabilitation therapy). We will recruit 210 stroke inpatients who meet the trial criteria and observe the remission of hand spasm and improvement of limb function after 4 weeks of intervention. The first evaluation indices are the remission of hand spasm and the duration of spasm remission. The second evaluation indices are the hand function of the affected limbs and the activities of daily living. When the accumulative total number of cases included reaches 120, a mid-term analysis will be conducted to determine any evidence that experimental intervention does have an advantage. DISCUSSION: Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of fascial-point acupuncture in relieving hand spasm after stroke. The results should provide more evidence for the clinical application of this therapy in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR), ID: ChiCTR1900022379.

31916203|t|Knockdown of IL-32 protects PC12 cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced injury via activation of Nrf2/NF-κB pathway.
31916203|a|Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of major causes of ischemic organ damage. It is well established that inflammatory cytokines serve as regulatory factors in cerebral oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). However, the involving mechanism is not clear enough. OGD/R PC12 cells were used as a hypoxia/reoxygenation model. IL-32 expression and cell viability were detected by qRT-PCR and CCK-8 assay, respectively. Cell apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry and western blotting. Protein levels of inflammatory factors, and the activity of MPO, MDA and SOD were analyzed. Furthermore, western blot assay was carried out to assess protein levels of Nrf2, keap1, NQO-1, p-p65, p-IκBα, p65 and IκBα. The results revealed that IL-32 expression was significantly upregulated in PC12 cells induced by OGD/R. Nrf2, keap1 and NQO-1 level was reduced while phosphorylation level of p65 and IκBα was up-regulated in OGD/R-induced PC12 cells. Mechanism investigations found that IL-32 silence elevated the level of Nrf2, Keap1 and NQO-1, reduced p-p65 and p-IκBα level, and regulated the contents of TNF-a, IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1 in OGD/R PC12 cells. In addition, knockdown of IL-32 suppressed production of intracellular ROS, elevated SOD activity, reduced MPO and MDA content, and enhanced cell viability. Furthermore, cell apoptosis was induced in OGD/R PC12 cells with IL-32 silence. However, Nrf2 inhibitor reversed the effects of IL-32 knockdown on OGD/R PC12 cells. This research suggests that IL-32 silence may alleviate OGD/R and Nrf2 plays an important role in the protection by IL-32 silence on PC12 cells induced by OGD/R.

31898161|t|Serum Neurofilament Light Predicts Severity and Prognosis in Patients with Ischemic Stroke.
31898161|a|Serum neurofilaments are markers of axonal injury. We investigated whether serum neurofilament light (sNfL) is a potential prognostic marker of functional outcome in Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). From May 2015 to December 2018, consecutive patients with AIS from the Department of Neurology of the Second Hospital of Jilin University were included. sNfL concentration was tested at baseline, and stroke severity was analyzed at admission using the NIHSS score. Functional outcome was assessed at discharge by the modified Rankin scale (mRS). The sNfL concentration was tested in 343 patients with a median value of 17.8 (IQR, 13.4-25.2) pg/ml. sNfL concentration paralleled lesion size (P = 0.035). At admission, 174 patients were defined as moderate-to-high stroke (NIHSS ≥ 5); the sNfL concentration in those patients were higher than that observed in patients with minor clinical severity [21.2 (IQR, 15.1-31.7) vs. 14.9 (11.8-19.4) pg/ml, P < 0.001]. For each 1 quartile increase of sNfL concentration, the unadjusted and adjusted risk of moderate-to-high stroke increased by 202% (with the OR of 3.04 (95% CI 2.15-4.32), P < 0.001) and 102% [2.02 (1.10-3.16), P = 0.001), respectively. At discharge, 85 patients (24.8%) had poor functional outcome (mRS, 3-6); the sNfL concentration in those patients were higher than that observed in patients with good outcome [24.1 (IQR, 18.8-33.9) vs. 15.7 (11.9-21.8) pg/ml, P < 0.001]. For each 1 quartile increase of sNfL concentration, the unadjusted and adjusted risk of poor outcome increased by 236% [with the OR of 3.36 (95% CI 2.23-5.06), P < 0.001] and 102% [2.29 (1.37-3.82), P < 0.001], respectively. The results show sNfL is meaningful blood biomarker to monitor stroke severity and functional outcome in ischemic stroke, suggesting that sNfL may play a role in stroke progression.

31743876|t|Microvascular pericytes in brain-associated vascular disease.
31743876|a|Pericytes, as mural cells of microvessels, are important regulators of vascular structure formation and function maintenance in the process of cerebrovascular maturation, cerebrovascular homeostasis and disease. In the recent years, they have gradually become the hot spot of the research. In fact, pericytes are not isolated cells. Their functions can't be played without the cooperation with surrounding cells. In the neurovascular unit (NVU), they communicate with other cells by direct contact or through signaling pathways to regulate cerebral vascular function and the state of blood vessels in response to changes in neural activity. Pericytes are closely related to the cerebrovascular and central nervous system disease. Currently, a large number of clinical and animal studies have confirmed that pericytes biological function is related to cerebral blood flow, blood-brain barrier permeability, cerebral vascular formation maintenance, and neuroinflammation. The objective of this review is to highlight the role of pericytes in cerebral microvessels as well as their relationships with stroke, dementia, and brain tumor disease. The possible pathogenic mechanisms between pericytes and these diseases will also be described. As a matter of fact, the role of pericytes in the brain-associated vascular disease may provide new ideas for clinical treatment.

31715314|t|Longitudinal tracing of white matter integrity on diffusion tensor imaging in the chronic cerebral ischemia and acute cerebral ischemia.
31715314|a|Brain ischemia leads to insufficient oxygen supply or hypoxia and thus to ischemic stroke or chronic hypoperfusion, which results in neuronal death and white matter damage is irreversible or partially recoverable under the interruption of blood flow more than a few minutes. The present study investigated the abnormal characteristics of white matter integrity after the chronic cerebral ischemia in a mouse model of bilateral carotid artery stenosis and the acute cerebral ischemia in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion via longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging, which revealed that the mean diffusivity of corpus callosum (cc) was decreased as early as the 1 st day after chronic cerebral ischemia, and then the damage gradually aggravated and lasted to the 28th day. Moreover, the brain regions, including cingulum (cg), dorsal hippocampal commissure (dhc), forceps major of the corpus callosum (fmj), alveus of the hippocampus (alv) and medial lemniscus (ml), were damaged in duration of 7∼28 days after chronic cerebral ischemia. Oppositely, white matter signals in the contralateral hemisphere appeared compensatory increase in the internal capsule (ic) at the 1 st day after acute cerebral ischemia, simultaneously the ipsilateral hemisphere signals were decreased in alv, cerebral peduncle (cp), external capsule (ec), ml, fimbria of the hippocampus (fi), ic, forceps minor of the corpus callosum (fmi) and dhc. While these regional white matter signals were decreased in the bilateral hemisphere at the 7th day after acute cerebral ischemia. In addition, the motor function was impaired after acute cerebral ischemia, and cognitive function were impaired after chronic and acute cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, voxel-wise analysis revealed the obvious differences of white matter integrity in these two models of ischemia. The chronic cerebral ischemia showed better white matter integrity in the ipsilateral hemisphere of acute cerebral ischemic model at the 1 st day after surgery, but worse in the contralateral hemisphere. Subsequently, these differences were reduced significantly and just only the ipsilateral cp and bilateral ml signals were higher in chronic cerebral ischemia. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the chronic and acute cerebral ischemia cause progressive damages of white matter that are irreversible in a relatively long time, of which the contralateral white matter present transient compensation in acute cerebral ischemia but not in chronic cerebral ischemia. These might be helpful to better diagnosis of clinical different cerebral ischemia.

31629858|t|Acrolein is involved in ischemic stroke-induced neurotoxicity through spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase activation.
31629858|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic stroke is the most common type of cerebrovascular event and is responsible for approximately 85% of all strokes in Taiwan. Neurons contain high concentrations of polyamines, which are prone to various pathological states in the brain and are perturbed after cerebral ischemia. Acrolein, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been suggested as the primary culprit of neuronal damage in stroke patients. However, the mechanism by which acrolein induces neuronal damage during ischemic stroke is not clear. METHODS: Urinary 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPMA), an acrolein-glutathione (GSH) metabolite, plasma acrolein-protein conjugates (Acr-PC) and plasma GSH levels were analyzed to correlate disease severity and prognosis of stroke patients compared with control subjects. In vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal models and an in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke model were used to investigate the mechanisms of acrolein-induced neuronal damage. RESULTS: A deregulated acrolein metabolism, including significantly increased plasma Acr-PC levels, decreased urinary 3-HPMA levels and decreased plasma GSH levels, was found in stroke patients compared to control subjects. We further observed that acrolein was produced during ischemia resulting in brain damage in in vivo MCAO animal model. The induction of acrolein in neuronal cells during OGD occurred due to the increased expression of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) by NF-kB pathway activation. In addition, acrolein elicited a vicious cycling of oxidative stress resulting in neurotoxicity. Finally, N-acetylcysteine effectively prevented OGD-induced neurotoxicity by scavenging acrolein. CONCLUSION: Overall, our current results demonstrate that acrolein is a culprit of neuronal damage through GSH depletion in stroke patients. The mechanism underlying the role of acrolein in stroke-related neuronal damage occurs through SSAT-induced polyamine oxidation by NF-kB pathway activation. These results provide a novel mechanism of neurotoxicity in stroke patients, aid in the development of neutralizing or preventive measures, and further our understanding of neural protection.

31602806|t|Automated label-free detection of injured neuron with deep learning by two-photon microscopy.
31602806|a|Stroke is a significant cause of morbidity and long-term disability globally. Detection of injured neuron is a prerequisite for defining the degree of focal ischemic brain injury, which can be used to guide further therapy. Here, we demonstrate the capability of two-photon microscopy (TPM) to label-freely identify injured neurons on unstained thin section and fresh tissue of rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model, revealing definite diagnostic features compared with conventional staining images. Moreover, a deep learning model based on convolutional neural network is developed to automatically detect the location of injured neurons on TPM images. We then apply deep learning-assisted TPM to evaluate the ischemic regions based on tissue edema, two-photon excited fluorescence signal intensity, as well as neuronal injury, presenting a novel manner for identifying the infarct core, peri-infarct area, and remote area. These results propose an automated and label-free method that could provide supplementary information to augment the diagnostic accuracy, as well as hold the potential to be used as an intravital diagnostic tool for evaluating the effectiveness of drug interventions and predicting potential therapeutics.

31535585|t|Economic evaluation of transferring first-stroke survivors to rehabilitation wards: A 10-year longitudinal, population-based study.
31535585|a|Background: Transferring stroke survivors to the rehabilitation ward for rehabilitation reduces long-term mortality; however, the long-term economic impact remains unknown.Objective: We aimed to assess the 10-year economic outcome of transferring first-stroke survivors to the rehabilitation ward.Methods: In this population-based, retrospective study, we examined the incremental costs per life year gained (ICLYG) for stroke survivors who were transferred to the rehabilitation ward (TR) as compared to that for those who underwent rehabilitation without being transferred to the rehabilitation ward (R) and those who did not undergo rehabilitation (NR). The differences in the daily medical expenditures among the three groups during the 10-year post-stroke period were examined.Results: After balancing characteristics of the three groups, the data of 14,544 first-stroke survivors between 1999 and 2003 were collected. The medical expenditure of index hospitalization was the lowest and the survival period was the longest in the TR group. The ICLYG of TR vs. NR (reference) was -388.5 (95% CI -396.2, -380.8) USD/year and that of TR vs. R (reference) was -121.5 (95% CI -130.4, -112.6) USD/year. The daily medical expenditure of the post-stroke survival period was significantly lower in the TR group (median 11.0, IQR 5.7-22.5 USD) than in the R (median 14.2, IQR 6.4-41.4 USD) and NR (median 19.5, IQR 6.4-88.2 USD) groups.Conclusions: The 10-year post-stroke follow-up showed that transferring patients to the rehabilitation ward is more cost effective than rehabilitation without transfer to the rehabilitation ward and no rehabilitation.

31415895|t|Influence of the Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 Geners3918242 Polymorphism on Development of Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-analysis.
31415895|a|BACKGROUND: The association between matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) gene -1562C/T (rs3918242) polymorphism and the susceptibility of ischemic stroke (IS) has been investigated. However, results were ambiguous and inconsistent. Therefore, we performed this study to better assess the potential relationship between rs3918242 polymorphism and susceptibility risk of IS. METHODS: We included case-control studies concerning the relationship between the rs3918242 polymorphism and IS, and odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to describe the associations. Furthermore, meta-regression analyses, heterogeneity, cumulative analyses, sensitivity analyses, and publication bias were examined. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were included for analysis. Significant associations with the risk of IS were detected for the rs3918242 polymorphism in overall population, Asians, and whites. When available data were stratified by gender, we found a significant correlation with the risk of IS in both males and females. Further subgroup analysis by the subtypes of IS showed that the rs3918242 polymorphism was significantly correlated with the risk of patients with large artery atherosclerosis. When stratified by age, we found that the rs3918242 polymorphism was significantly correlated with the risk of IS in patients both aged ≥65 years and >65 years. Both the diabetes and the nondiabetes subgroups reached significant results, and in an analysis stratified by smoking status, an increased risk of IS was associated with smoking. CONCLUSIONS: The rs3918242 polymorphism may be a susceptible predictor of susceptibility of IS. Further large-scale studies are needed to verify the results of our findings.

31708024|t|A photostable Si-rhodamine-based near-infrared fluorescent probe for monitoring lysosomal pH during heat stroke.
31708024|a|Heat stroke is a symptom of hyperthermia with a temperature of more than 40 °C, which usually leads to all kinds of physical discomfort and even death. It is necessary to study the mechanism of action of heat stroke on cells or organelles (such as cytotoxicity of heat) and the processes of cells or organelles during heat stroke. Recent studies have shown that there is a certain correlation between heat stroke and lysosome acidity. In order to clarify their relationship, Lyso-NIR-pH, a photostable Si-rhodamine-based near-infrared fluorescent probe, was developed for sensing pH changes in lysosomes during heat stroke in this paper. For Lyso-NIR-pH, a morpholine group is employed as the lysosome-targeting unit and a H+-triggered openable deoxylactam is employed as the response unit to pH. Lyso-NIR-pH can detect pH with a high selectivity and a sensitivity, and its pKa is 4.63. Lyso-NIR-pH also has outstanding imaging performances, such as excellent lysosome-targeting ability, low autofluorescence and photostable fluorescence signal, which are in favor of long-term imaging of pH with accurate fluorescence signals. Moreover, we successfully applied Lyso-NIR-pH to monitor lysosomal pH increases induced by chloroquine and apoptosis in live cells. Finally, we successfully applied Lyso-NIR-pH for monitoring changes of lysosomal pH during heat stroke. These results confirmed that Lyso-NIR-pH is a powerful tool to monitor pH change in lysosomes and study its possible effects.

The present study aimed to verify the efficiency of motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) control of continuous passive motion (CPM) in the recovery of wrist extension due to stroke. An observational study was conducted in 26 chronic stroke patients, aged 49.0 ± 15.4 years, with upper extremity motor impairment. All patients showed no wrist extension recovery. A 24-channel highresolution electroencephalogram (EEG) system was used to acquire cortical signal while they were imagining extension of the affected wrist. Then, 20 sessions of BCI-driven CPM training were carried out for 6 weeks. Primary outcome was the increase of active range of motion (ROM) of the affected wrist from the baseline to final evaluation. Improvement of modified Barthel Index, EEG classification and motor imagery pattern of wrist extension were recorded as secondary outcomes. Twenty-one patients finally passed the EEG screening and completed all the BCI-driven CPM trainings. From baseline to the final evaluation, the increase of active ROM of the affected wrists was (24.05 ± 14.46)˚. The increase of modified Barthel Index was 3.10 ± 4.02 points. But no statistical difference was detected between the baseline and final evaluations (P > 0.05). Both EEG classification and motor imagery pattern improved. The present study demonstrated beneficial outcomes of MI-based BCI control of CPM training in motor recovery of wrist extension using motor imagery signal of brain in chronic stroke patients.

31882831|t|Association between Serum Gamma-glutamyl transferase and Intracranial Arterial Calcification in Acute Ischemic Stroke Subjects.
31882831|a|Intracranial artery calcification (IAC) is an important risk factor for cerebral infarction and a key biomarker for intracranial artery stenosis. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) has been independently associated with increased cardiovascular events and coronary calcification. Our study assessed whether GGT is an independent factor for IAC in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. This cross-sectional study involved a total of 754 patients with AIS (mean age: 65 ± 13.2 years). All the patients had received brain computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination to evaluate IAC. Further, serum GGT levels and other biochemical parameters were analyzed. The average GGT level in patients who died was also significantly increased (37.0 ± 26.8 vs 29.0 ± 21.5 U/L, p = 0.012). Partial correlation analysis showed that serum GGT levels were associated with NIHSS score at admission after adjustment for age and gender was considered (r = 0.150, p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that serum GGT levels independently predicted all-cause mortality (OR = 1.036, 95% CI: 1.014-1.060, p = 0.002), NIHSS scores (β = 0.051, 95% CI: 0.020-0.082, p = 0.001) and IAC scores (β = 0.006, 95% CI: 0.003-0.014, p = 0.005) in male patients. Each SD (standard deviation) increase of serum GGT levels was also associated with risk of all-cause mortality (OR = 2.272, 95% CI: 1.364-3.787, P = 0.002). GGT levels in patients with severe IAC were significantly elevated (37.6 ± 33.6 vs 28.6 ± 19.2, p < 0.001). However, serum GGT levels could not independently predict the severity of IAC in AIS patients. Our study identified that serum GGT levels were significantly elevated in patients who died, and the GGT levels had a certain association with the risk of death and IAC in male patients.

31867903|t|[Research advances in neurovascular unit mechanism in acupuncture treatment of ischemic stroke].
31867903|a|Ischemic stroke is a type of clinical syndrome caused by brain blood supply disorders due to various cerebrovascular diseases, which lead to local cerebral ischemia, hypoxic necrosis, and corresponding neurological defects. In recent years, the neurovascular unit mechanism of ischemic stroke has been proposed in modern medicine. With the principles of syndrome differentiation-based treatment and holistic view in traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture has the advantage of multi-target and multi-link effect and good clinical efficacy on this disease, and current studies have shown that acupuncture has a marked effect on each component and the whole of neurovascular unit. This article reviews the effect of acupuncture on the regulation of blood-brain barrier, astrocytes, microglial cells, neurons, and neurovascular units.

31882240|t|Tibetan Medicated Bathing Therapy for Patients With Post-stroke Limb Spasticity: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.
31882240|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the short- (4 weeks) and long-term (6 month) effectiveness of Tibetan medicated bathing therapy in patients with post-stroke limb spasticity. DESIGN: Prospective, blinded, randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS: Post-stroke patients with limb spasticity were recruited between December 2013 and February 2017 and randomly assigned 1:1 to a control group that received conventional rehabilitation (n = 222) or an experimental group that received Tibetan medicated bathing therapy in combination with conventional rehabilitation (n = 222). METHODS: All patients received conventional rehabilitation. In addition, the experimental group received Tibetan medicated bathing therapy. The interventions were conducted 5 times per week for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was changes from baseline after 4 weeks of therapy in muscle tone in the spastic muscles (elbow flexors, wrist flexors, finger flexors, knee extensors, ankle plantar flexors), as measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). RESULTS: The mean change from baseline after 4 weeks of therapy in the MAS score for the elbow flexors (P = .017), wrist flexors (P < .001), and ankle plantar flexors (P < .001) was significantly greater in patients in the experimental group compared to the control group. The benefit was maintained for 3 muscle groups (elbow flexors P < .001, wrist flexors P = .001, and ankle plantar flexors P < .001) and 6 months (elbow flexors P < .001, wrist flexors P = .002, and ankle plantar flexors P < .001) after therapy. All adverse events were mild, and no serious adverse reactions to Tibetan medicated bathing therapy were recorded. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Tibetan medicated bathing therapy, in combination with conventional rehabilitation, has potential as a safe, effective treatment for the alleviation of post-stroke upper limb spasticity. Tibetan medicated bathing therapy was most advantageous for patients who had a baseline muscle tone score of 1+ to 2 on the MAS in the affected limb and recent onset of stroke (duration of the disease of 1-3 months).

31878035|t|The Potential Role of MicroRNA-124 in Cerebral Ischemia Injury.
31878035|a|Cerebral ischemia injury, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, initiates sequential molecular and cellular pathologies that underlie ischemic encephalopathy (IE), such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, etc. Targeted therapeutic treatments are urgently needed to tackle the pathological processes implicated in these neurological diseases. Recently, accumulating studies demonstrate that microRNA-124 (miR-124), the most abundant miRNA in brain tissue, is aberrant in peripheral blood and brain vascular endothelial cells following cerebral ischemia. Importantly, miR-124 regulates a variety of pathophysiological processes that are involved in the pathogenesis of age-related IE. However, the role of miR-124 has not been systematically illustrated. Paradoxically, miR-124 exerts beneficial effects in the age-related IE via regulating autophagy, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal excitability, neurodifferentiation, Aβ deposition, and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, while it may play a dual role via regulating apoptosis and exerts detrimental effects on synaptic plasticity and axonal growth. In the present review, we thus focus on the paradoxical roles of miR-124 in age-related IE, as well as the underlying mechanisms. A great understanding of the effects of miR-124 on the hypoxic-ischemic brain will open new avenues for therapeutic approaches to protect against cerebral ischemia injury.

31920923|t|A Network-Based Method for Mechanistic Investigation and Neuroprotective Effect on Post-treatment of Senkyunolid-H Against Cerebral Ischemic Stroke in Mouse.
31920923|a|Senkyunolide-H (SEH), a major bioactive compound extracted from Ligusticum chuanxiong, has been reported to be effective in preventing cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS). In this study, we employed network pharmacology to reveal potential mechanism of SEH against CIS on a system level and confirmed the therapeutic effects of SEH on CIS by models of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in vivo and in vitro. Through protein-protein interaction networks construction of SEH- and CIS-related targets, a total of 62 key targets were obtained by screening topological indices and analyzed for Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that SEH might have a role in treating CIS via regulating some biological processes including regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling, and some molecular function, such as transcription factor and protein phosphatase binding and nitric oxide synthase regulator activity. Meanwhile, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway was significantly enriched. In addition, our result showed that SEH posttreatment significantly decreased the neurological scores, infarct volume, and neuronal death in the middle cerebral artery occlusion mice. Moreover, the PI3K/Akt/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway was activated by intragastric administration of 40 mg/kg SEH, as verified by Western blot. In vitro, treatment of PC12 cells with 100 μM SEH markedly reduced cell death induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation through the activation of PI3K/Akt/nuclear factor kappa B pathway, and the therapeutic effect of SEH was obviously inhibited by 10 μM LY294002. In summary, these results suggested that SEH carries a therapeutic potential in CIS involving multiple targets and pathways, and the most crucial mechanism might be through the activation of PI3K/Akt/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to inhibit inflammatory factor releases and increase the antiapoptosis capacity. Our study furnishes the future traditional Chinese medicine research with a network pharmacology framework.

31920724|t|MRI Evaluation of Axonal Remodeling After Combination Treatment With Xiaoshuan Enteric-Coated Capsule and Enriched Environment in Rats After Ischemic Stroke.
31920724|a|Xiaoshuan enteric-coated capsule (XSEC) is a compound Chinese medicine widely used for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Enriched environment (EE) is a rehabilitative intervention designed to facilitate physical, cognitive, and social activity after brain injury. This study aimed to assess whether the XSEC and EE combination could provide synergistic efficacy in axonal remodeling compared to that with a single treatment after ischemic stroke using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by histological analysis. Rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion and treated with XSEC and EE alone or in combination for 30 days. T2-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed to examine the infarct volume and axonal remodeling, respectively. The co-localization of Ki67 with NG2 or CNPase was examined by immunofluorescence staining to assess oligodendrogenesis. The expressions of growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and growth inhibitors NogoA/Nogo receptor (NgR)/RhoA/Rho-associated kinase2 (ROCK2) were measured using western blot and qRT-PCR. The Morris water maze (MWM) was performed to evaluate the cognitive function. MRI and histological measurements indicated XSEC and EE individually benefited axonal reorganization after stroke. Notably, XSEC + EE decreased infarct volume compared with XSEC or EE monotherapy and increased ipsilateral residual volume compared with vehicle group. DTI showed XSEC + EE robustly increased fractional anisotropy while decreased axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity in the injured cortex, striatum, and external capsule. Meanwhile, diffusion tensor tractography revealed XSEC + EE elevated fiber density in the cortex and external capsule and increased fiber length in the striatum and external capsule compared with the monotherapies. These MRI measurements, confirmed by histology, showed that XSEC + EE promoted axonal restoration. Additionally, XSEC + EE amplified oligodendrogenesis, decreased the expressions of NogoA/NgR/RhoA/ROCK2, and increased the expression of GAP-43 in the peri-infarct tissues. In parallel to these findings, rats treated with XSEC + EE exhibited higher cognitive recovery than those treated with XSEC or EE monotherapy, as evidenced by MWM test. Taken together, our data implicated that XSEC + EE exerted synergistic effects on alleviating atrophy and encouraging axonal reorganization partially by promoting oligodendrogenesis and overcoming intrinsic growth-inhibitory signaling, thereby facilitating higher cognitive recovery.

31888139|t|Multimodal Laser Stimulation and Traditional Needle Acupuncture in Post-Stroke Patients-A Pilot Cross-Over Study with Results from Near Infrared Spectroscopy.
31888139|a|Background: The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the cerebral effects of laser stimulation and traditional needle acupuncture in patients after stroke. Methods: Seventeen stroke patients (12 female and five male; mean age ± SD: 66.5 ± 12.9 years) were randomly selected in a stroke rehabilitation hospital. Patients' regional cerebral blood oxygen saturation (rSO2) values were recorded before, during, and after needle acupuncture (scalp, ear and body) as well as before, during, and after corresponding laser stimulation (red laser, four points: 100 mW, 658 nm, 500 µm; yellow laser, one point: 50 mW, 589 nm, 500 µm; infrared laser, three points: 100 mW, 810 nm, 500 µm; green laser, one point: 5 mW, 532 nm, 500 µm) in a cross-over study design. Results: There were no significant changes after needle acupuncture in the phases immediately after needle insertion or during acupuncture stimulation. However, after manual needle acupuncture and after laser stimulation, the majority of the rSO2 values showed increases. The highest value (+3%) was reached after laser stimulation treatment. Heart rate and blood pressure before and after the treatments did not show significant alterations. Conclusions: Changes in local cerebral oxygen saturation could be quantified, although confirmation may only be expected after extensive follow-up studies.

31920641|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Salidroside on Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion-Induced Behavioral Impairment Involves the Dopaminergic System.
31920641|a|Salidroside, a phenylpropanoid glycoside, is the main bioactive component of Rhodiola rosea L. Salidroside has prominent anti-stroke effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion models. However, the underlying mechanisms of its actions are poorly understood. This study examined the anti-stroke effects of salidroside in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced rat model of stroke and its potential mechanisms involving the dopaminergic system. Salidroside administration increased the levels of dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the ipsilateral striatum after induction of transient ischemia, which were assessed using microdialysis with high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Furthermore, treatment with salidroside ameliorated neurobehavioral impairment, assessed with the modified neurological severity scores (mNSS), the balance beam test, and the foot fault test. Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) suggested that MCAO-induced reduction in monoamine oxidase (MAO) was inhibited by salidroside. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses revealed high level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the ipsilateral striatal caudate putamen (CPu) after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, which could be further elevated by salidroside. In addition, salidroside could reverse the decreased immunoreactivity of TH in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). These results suggest that the anti-stroke effects of salidroside in MCAO-induced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion may involve the modulation of monoamine metabolism in the striatum and SNpc, which may be related to the function of the dopaminergic system in the rat brain.

31835774|t|Exercise Training Enhances Platelet Mitochondrial Bioenergetics in Stroke Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
31835774|a|Exercise training (ET) may impact physical fitness by affecting mitochondrial functions. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of ET on aerobic capacity and platelet mitochondrial bioenergetics (MTB) in stroke patients. Among the 30 stroke patients who underwent the traditional rehabilitation program (TRP), 15 were randomly assigned to have ET (50-60% VO2peak for 30 min/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks), and those remaining received only the TRP (control group). The peak exercise capacity (VO2peak) and platelet MTB, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the electron transport chain (ETC), were measured through automatic gas analysis and high-resolution respirometry, respectively. The results demonstrated that ET significantly increased the VO2peak (17.7%) and O2 uptake efficiency slope (31.9%) but decreased the ventilation versus CO2 production slope (-7.65%). Patients who underwent ET also had significantly enhanced platelet mitochondrial OXPHOS and ETC by activating the FADH2 (Complex II)-dependent pathway, but depressed plasma myeloperoxidase (-28.4%) and interleukin-6 levels (-29.9%). Moreover, changes in VO2peak levels were positively correlated with changes in platelet OXPHOS and ETC capacities. In conclusion, ET increases the platelet MTB by enhancing Complex II activity in stroke patients. The exercise regimen also enhances aerobic fitness and depresses oxidative stress/pro-inflammatory status in stroke patients.

31817993|t|An Overview of Systematic Reviews and Meta- analyses on Acupuncture for Post-acute Stroke Dysphagia.
31817993|a|BACKGROUND: Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) on acupuncture treatment for post-acute stroke dysphagia have been published. Conflicting results from different SRs necessitated an overview to summarize and assess the quality of this evidence to determine whether acupuncture is effective for this condition. The aim was to evaluate methodological quality and summarizing the evidence for important outcomes. METHODS: Seven databases were searched for SRs and/or meta-analysis of RCTs and quasi-RCTs on acupuncture for post-acute stroke dysphagia. Two authors independently identified SRs and meta-analyses, collected data to assess the quality of included SRs and meta analyses according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2). RESULTS: Searches yielded 382 SRs, 31 were included. The quality of 22 SRs was critically low, five SRs were low, and four Cochrane SRs were moderate when evaluated by AMSTAR2. A total of 17 SRs reported 85.2-96.3% of PRISMA items. Five SRs included explanatory RCTs, 16 SRs included pragmatic RCTs, and 10 SRs included both. CONCLUSION: Currently, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture on post-acute stroke dysphagia is of a low quality. The type of study appeared to have no direct influence on the result, but the primary outcome measures showed a relationship with the quality of SRs. High quality trials with large sample sizes should be the focus of future research.

31401319|t|Botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of Ilex pubescens Hook et Arn.
31401319|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ilex pubescens (I. pubescens), which is well known in Chinese as Mao-Dong-Qing, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. This plant is distributed in the wild in southern China, and the roots and stems are used for clearing heat, detoxifying, activating blood circulation and dispelling stasis. Moreover, it is used for treating wind-heat cold, lung-heat asthma, swelling and pain of pharynxes and gingivae, thoracic obstruction and cardiodynia with pungent, stroke, hemiplegia, thromboangiitis obliterans, burn, scald and central retinitis. AIMS OF THE REVIEW: This paper aims to provide a critical summary of the current studies on I. pubescens. The progress in research on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of the plant is discussed. We mainly focus on the phytochemical and pharmacological investigations of I. pubescens. Furthermore, perspectives for possible future studies on I. pubescens are also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted on the studies of I. pubescens performed during the past 40 years with resources including the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and literature databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Wiley, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), SciFinder, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Baidu Scholar. RESULTS: To date, more than 200 compounds have been isolated and identified from the plant, a substantial proportion of which were reported to be triterpenes. Biological effects such as protective effects against cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, anti-thrombosis, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour activities were also investigated in in vitro and in vivo research. Therapeutic effects are attributed to the bioactivities of the naturally occurring compounds in this herb. Furthermore, toxicological studies on I. pubescens are relatively scarce, and it is worthy of further research. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes the results from current studies of I. pubescens, which is one of the valuable medicinal sources from traditional herbs. Some conventional uses have been evaluated by pharmacological investigation. In addition, unresolved issues include molecular mechanisms underlying bioactivities, pharmacokinetics, toxicology and efficacy, which are still being studied and explored before achieving integration into clinical medicines.

31866861|t|Efficacy and Safety of Ginkgo Leaf Extract and Dipyridamole Injection for Ischemic Stroke: A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis.
31866861|a|Objective: Ginkgo leaf extract and dipyridamole injection (GDI), a kind of Chinese medicine preparation, has been considered as a promising supplementary treatment for ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of GDI mediated therapy for ischemic stroke. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Chinese Biological Medicine Database (CBM), were searched systematically for clinical trials of conventional treatments combined with GDI for ischemic stroke. The reported outcomes including overall response, hemorrheology and blood lipid indexes, and adverse events were systematically investigated. Results: Data from thirty-nine trials including 3,182 ischemic stroke patients were involved. The results indicated that, compared with conventional treatments alone, the combination of conventional treatments with GDI obviously improved the overall response (odds ratio [OR] = 4.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.26-5.25, P < 0.00001), neurological status (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, OR = -3.13, 95% CI = -3.98 to -2.28, P < 0.00001) and activity of daily living (Barthel Index score, OR = 14.10, 95% CI = 9.51-18.68, P < 0.00001) of patients. Moreover, the hemorheology and blood lipids indexes of ischemic stroke patients were also significantly ameliorated after the combined therapy (P < 0.01). The frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Evidence from the meta-analysis suggested that the combination of conventional treatments and GDI is safe and more effective in treating ischemic stroke than conventional treatments alone. Therefore, GDI mediated therapy could be recommended as an adjuvant treatment for ischemic stroke.

31792665|t|Involvement of PARP-1/AIF Signaling Pathway in Protective Effects of Gualou Guizhi Decoction Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury-Induced Apoptosis.
31792665|a|Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury is a complex pathophysiological process. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)/apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) signaling pathway-mediated apoptosis is one of the non-caspase-dependent cell death programs that are widely present in neurological diseases such as stroke. In our study, we aimed to conduct further research on the effects of Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) on the PARP-1/AIF signaling pathway in cell apoptosis after ischemia-reperfusion injury caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The results showed that GLGZD administration for 7 days significantly ameliorated MCAO-induced neurological damage, limb paralysis and the pathological state of the ischemic cortex. GLGZD exerted its effects by significantly reducing the volume of ischemic cerebral infarction, increasing the number of Nissl-positive cells, and reducing neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that GLGZD significantly inhibited the total protein expression of PARP-1, PAR, AIF and endonuclease G (Endo G) in the ischemic cortex and significantly increased the total protein expression of heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70). On the one hand, the expression of PARP-1, AIF and Endo G protein in the nucleus significantly decreased while the expression of PAR nucleoprotein significantly upregulated. On the other hand, compared with the MCAO model group, the GLGZD-treated group showed a significantly reduced protein expression of PAR in mitochondria and significantly increased protein expression of mitochondrial AIF and Endo G. It was concluded that GLGZD had good therapeutic effects in MCAO model rats. These effects were closely related to GLGZD-mediated inhibition of ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulation of protein expression and translocation in the PARP-1/AIF signaling pathway.

31588805|t|Lycium barbarum polysaccharide alleviates oxygen glucose deprivation-induced PC-12 cells damage by up-regulating miR-24.
31588805|a|Objective: This research was aimed to detect the functions of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) on oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) injury and potential mechanisms at PC-12 cells. Methods: CCK-8, flow cytometry and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays were used to detect OGD, LBPs and miR-24 effects on cell viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. MiR-24 was transfected and texted by transfection and qRT-PCR. Moreover, the related-protein levels of apoptosis, autophagy and pathways were tested by Western blotting. Results: LBPs significantly enhanced cell viability , inhibited cell apoptosis, autophagy and ROS level in OGD injury. In addition, miR-24 expression was declined in OGD-treated cells, while it was elevated when added LBPs. The preventive effects of LBPs on PC-12 cell damage induced by OGD were reversed by down-regulating miR-24. Furthermore, miR-24 inhibitor declined LBPs-induced change in Wnt/β-catenin and JAK1/STAT3 pathways in OGD-injuried cells. Conclusions: LBPs exhibited preventive effects via up-regulating miR-122 and activating Wnt/β-catenin and JAK1/STAT3 pathways in OGD-induced PC-12 cells.

31780034|t|Qing-Xin-Jie-Yu Granule for patients with stable coronary artery disease (QUEST Trial): A multicenter, double-blinded, randomized trial.
31780034|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Despite optimal secondary preventive treatment, patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. This multicenter, double-blinded, randomized trial sought to determine whether the addition of Qing-Xin-Jie-Yu Granule (QXJYG), a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, to standard therapy would further reduce risk of cardiovascular events in patients with SCAD. METHODS: A total of 1500 patients with documented SCAD were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to QXJYG or placebo for 6 months, and followed up for another 6 months. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary revascularization. Near the end of the trial, but before unblinding, a commonly used composite 'hard' endpoint composed of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke was additionally analyzed. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 months, no significant difference of the primary outcome between the two groups was observed (1.59% vs. 1.62%; hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.13-1.28). However, absolute risk of the composite 'hard' endpoint was reduced by 0.99% (0.31% vs. 1.30%; hazard ratio, 0.06; 95%CI, 0.01 to 0.53). No difference of adverse events between the two groups was observed. CONCLUSION: In patients with SCAD, the addition of QXJYG to standard therapy was associated with reduced risk of nonfatal MI and the composite 'hard' endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI and stroke.

31779994|t|The utility of traditional Chinese medicine (Shenmai) in the cardiac rehabilitation after coronary artery bypass grafting: A single-center randomized clinical trial.
31779994|a|OBJECTIVE: examine the efficacy and safety of Shenmai to the cardiac rehabilitation in patients received coronary artery bypass grafting. DESIGN: a single-center randomized, single blind clinical trial. SETTING: Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. SUBJECTS: Patients with coronary artery disease who received coronary artery bypass grafting in our center were studied. They must be competent to complete the 6-minute walking test without any assistance and without any severe comorbidity. INTERVENTIONS: in Shemmai group, the participants were treated with Shenmai injection (100 ml/day) right after the surgery to discharge for 9.28 ± 3.75 days and then capsule (3.6 g/day) sequentially for 30 days in addition to the cardiac rehabilitation. In control group, only cardiac rehabilitation was conducted. MAIN MEASURES: the 6-Minute Walking Test was measured at three time points: one day before operation, on the day of discharge and 30 days follow up. RESULTS: The sample (n = 166) was predominately male (84%), with mean age was 61.12 ± 9.13 years. There was no significant difference between groups in baseline characteristics and the procedural characteristics. There was one death in control group and one stroke in Shenmai group right after the surgery. Overall, there was group (p = .005) and time effect (p < .001) on the 6-minute walking distance. Participants in the Shenmai group walked longer distance in meters compared with control group on the day of discharge (314.54 ± 64.14 vs. 271.29 ± 76.82, P < .001), while no significant differences before operation (399.72 ± 93.19 vs. 403.67 ± 91.99, p = .78) and on 30-day follow up (436.54 ± 67.64 vs. 421.64 ± 83.53, p = .21). CONCLUSION: Shenmai improves the exercise tolerance in the early stage of the cardiac rehabilitation for patients received coronary artery bypass grafting.

31222746|t|Silencing of PTGS2 exerts promoting effects on angiogenesis endothelial progenitor cells in mice with ischemic stroke via repression of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
31222746|a|The objective of the current study is to investigate the effect of PTGS2 on proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and apoptosis of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in mice with ischemic stroke through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established in mice. EPCs were identified, in which ectopic expression and depletion experiments were conducted. The mRNA and protein expression of related factors in tissues and cells were measured. Besides, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, as well as cell cycle distribution, of cells were determined. MCAO mice showed overexpression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-17, and IL-23, and increased positive protein expression of PTGS2, as well as expression of PTGS2, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), tumor suppressor region 1 (TSP-1) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), but underexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2), and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Moreover, ectopic expression of tumor necrosis factor-α significantly elevated the expression of PTGS2, NF-κB, TSP-1, and Bax, as well as cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, but decreased the expression of VEGF, Skp2, and Bcl-2, as well as proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of EPCs, and the PTGS2-siRNA group showed an opposite trend. Taken together, we conclude that the specific knockdown of PTGS2 expression could repress the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby inhibits apoptosis and promotes proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of EPCs, providing protective effect on mice with ischemic stroke.

31447358|t|Association between homocysteine and multivascular atherosclerosis in stroke-related vascular beds determined by three-dimensional magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging.
31447358|a|BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis in stroke-related vascular beds is the major cause of stroke. Studies demonstrated that multivascular atherosclerosis is prevalent in stroke patients and those with multivascular plaques had higher risk of recurrent stroke. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the relationship between homocysteine and multivascular atherosclerosis in stroke-related vascular beds using magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: Patients with recent ischemic cerebrovascular symptoms were enrolled and underwent three-dimensional magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging for intracranial arteries, extracranial carotid arteries and aortic arch. Traditional risk factors and homocysteine were measured. Presence of multivascular plaques defined as plaques in at least two stroke-related vascular beds on magnetic resonance imaging was determined. The relationship between homocysteine and characteristics of multivascular plaques was determined. RESULTS: Of 49 enrolled patients (mean age: 56.3 ± 13.8 years; 35 males), 23 had multivascular plaques. Homocysteine (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.34; p = 0.022) and age (odds ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.41; p = 0.002) were significantly associated with presence of multivascular plaques. The adjusted associations remained significant (both p < 0.05). In discriminating presence of multivascular plaques, the area-under-the-curve of age, homocysteine and combination of them was 0.79, 0.70 and 0.87 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Homocysteine is independently associated with stroke-related multivascular plaques and combination of age and homocysteine has stronger predictive value.

31876755|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is one of the most serious cardiovascular diseases. Shenqi Fuzheng injection (SQFZI), as a Chinese herbal injection, is usually used for the treatment of CHF. However, the clinical evidence of SQFZI for the treatment of CHF is unclear. METHODS: Two researchers will dependently search literatures of SQFZI for CHF from Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database, VIP database, Chinese Biological and Medicine database, Wangfang database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. These inclusive data of included studies will be conducted by RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: This meta-analysis and systematic review will provide a series of outcome measures to verify clinical efficacy and safety of SQFZI for treating CHF, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) function classification, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, cardiac output, stroke volume, brain natriuretic peptide, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis and systematic review will provide up-to-date clinical evidence to assess SQFZI treatment efficacy for CHF patients.

31852125|t|Efficacy and safety of Shenmayizhi decoction as an adjuvant treatment for vascular dementia: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
31852125|a|BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia. The treatment of VaD still remains a challenge so far. Traditional Chinese Herbal medicine is a promising therapy due to their multiple components and targets. Shenmayizhi decoction (SMYZD), a Chinese Herbal prescription, has been reported its effective in alleviating cognitive dysfunction in clinical practice. However, strong clinical research of SMYZD in the treatment of VaD was lack. Therefore, we design this study to evaluate the adjuvant role of SMYZD in the treatment of VaD. METHODS: This is a multicenter, randomized, blind, controlled trial. A total of 196 eligible patients will be assigned to receive Ginkgo biloba extracts (GBEs) plus SMYZD granule or GBEs plus SMYZD mimetic granule in a 1:1 ratio. The duration of the trial will be 12 weeks, and a follow-up will be performed at the 24th week. The primary outcomes are the National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) and the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The secondary outcomes include the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome scale, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), concentrations of hypersensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and homocysteine (HCY) in serum. Researchers will record any adverse events throughout the trial. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidences to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SMYZD in combination with GBEs in treatment of VaD, as well as the adjuvant role of SMYZD in combination.

31470105|t|KCa3.1 deficiency attenuates neuroinflammation by regulating an astrocyte phenotype switch involving the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β pathway.
31470105|a|Neuroinflammation may induce a phenotype switch to reactive astrogliosis in neurodegenerative disorders. The calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa3.1) is active in the phenotypic switch that occurs during astrogliosis in Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke. Here, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), immunohistochemistry, western blotting, pharmacological blockade, and calcium imaging were used to investigate astrocyte KCa3.1 activity in neuroinflammation, Tau accumulation, and insulin signaling deficits in male wild-type C57BL/6 and KCa3.1-/- knockout (KO) mice, and in primary astrocyte cultures. KCa3.1 deficiency in KO mice decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced memory deficits, neuronal loss, glial activation, Tau phosphorylation, and insulin signaling deficits in vivo. KCa3.1 expression in astrocytes was associated with LPS-induced upregulation of the Orai1 store-operated Ca2+ channel protein. The KCa3.1 channel was found to regulate store-operated Ca2+ overload through an interaction with Orai1 in LPS-induced reactive astrocytes. The LPS-induced effects on KCa3.1 and Orai1 indirectly promoted astrogliosis-related changes via the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β and NF-κB signaling pathways in vitro. Unbiased evaluation of RNA-Seq results for actively translated RNAs confirmed that substantial astrocyte diversity was associated with KCa3.1 deficiency. Our results suggest that KCa3.1 regulated astrogliosis-mediated neuroinflammation, Tau accumulation, and insulin signaling deficiency via PI3K/AKT/GSK3β and NF-κB signaling pathways, and contributing to neuronal loss and memory deficits in this neuroinflammation mouse model.

30712471|t|Proteomic Analysis of Hydroxysafflor Yellow A Against Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Rats.
30712471|a|Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), an active component from Chinese medicinal herb, has been applied to the prevention and treatment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). To clarify the comprehensive mechanisms HSYA for stroke, we used label-free quantitative proteomic analysis to investigate the modulated proteins of rats subjected to CIRI and their alteration by HSYA. Neurological examination, infarct assessment, and biochemical assay were performed to validate the effects of HSYA, and the results indicated that HSYA played a significant role in brain protection. A total of 13 proteins were identified as overlapped proteins by label-free quantitative proteomic analysis. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis showed that these differentially expressed proteins were mainly enriched in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway. Furthermore, networks were constructed with respect to protein function interactions. The results suggested that seven proteins were identified as hub proteins between model and sham groups, while 25 proteins were identified as hub proteins between HSYA and model groups. In addition, the expressions of three overlapping proteins were validated by Western blot, and their levels were consistent with the results of label-free analysis. In conclusion, Eftud2, mTOR, Rab11, Ppp2r5e, and HIF-1 signaling pathways have been detected as key hub proteins and pathways in HSYA against CIRI through proteomic analysis. Our research has provided convincing explanations for the mechanism of HSYA against CIRI and the identified key proteins and pathways might provide novel therapeutics for CIRI.

31782597|t|Synthesis and Target Identification of Benzoxepane Derivatives as Potential Anti-Neuroinflammatory Agents for Ischemic Stroke.
31782597|a|Benzoxepane derivatives were designed and synthesized, and one hit compound emerged as being effective in vitro with low toxicity. In vivo, this hit compound ameliorated both sickness behavior through anti-inflammation in LPS-induced neuroinflammatory mice model and cerebral ischemic injury through anti-neuroinflammation in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Target fishing for the hit compound using photoaffinity probes led to identification of PKM2 as the target protein responsible for anti-inflammatory effect of the hit compound. Furthermore, the hit exhibited an anti-neuroinflammatory effect in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting PKM2-mediated glycolysis and NLRP3 activation, indicating PKM2 as a novel target for neuroinflammation and its related brain disorders. This hit compound has a better safety profile compared to shikonin, a reported PKM2 inhibitor, identifying it as a lead compound in targeting PKM2 for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases.

31777227|t|[Effect of scalp acupuncture stimulation on expression of pentraxin 3 in striatum in acute ische-mic cerebrovascular disease rats].
31777227|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of scalp-acupuncture on the expression of pentraxin 3 (PTX3), Interleukin (IL)-1β, zonula occludens-1(ZO-1) mRNA and Occludin mRNA in striatum in acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease (AICD) rats, so as to investigate its mechanisms underlying improvement of AICD. METHODS: Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly allocated to control, model, IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture groups (n=12 rats in each group). The AICD model was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Rats of the IL-1Ra group and IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture group received intraperitoneal injection of IL-1Ra (0.05 mg·kg-1·d-1), once daily for 6 days. Scalp acupuncture stimulation was applied to bilateral "Dingnieqianxiexian" (MS6) once daily for 6 days for rats in IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture group. Before and after intervention, the neurologic deficit score (NDS) was evalua-ted according to Longa's method. The expression of striatum PTX3 and IL-1β was detected by immunohistochemistry, and ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA in the striatum tissue were detected by fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR. The Evans Blue (EB) tracer method was used to monitor the degree of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage. RESULTS: Following modeling, the NDS, EB content and the expression of PTX3 and IL-1β in the striatum tissue were significantly increased, and the ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression was considerably decreased in the model group compared with the control group (P<0.05). After the interventions and compared with the model group, the NDS, EB content in both IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture groups, and PTX3 in the IL-1Ra group were significantly down-regulated (P<0.05), while the striatum ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression in both IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture groups, and PTX3 in the IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture group were obviously up-regulated (P<0.05), and the expression of IL-1β was obviously down-regulated in the IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture group (P<0.05) rather than in the IL-1Ra group (P>0.05). The effects of scalp acupuncture combined with IL-1Ra were obviously superior to that of IL-1Ra in down-regulating NDS, EB content and IL-1β expression level, and in up-regulating PTX3, ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression levels (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture can improve neurological function and reduce the degree of BBB injury in AICD rats, which may be associated with its function in up-regulating the expression of PTX3 and in promoting the expression of ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA.

31755304|t|Synthesis of phthalide derivatives and evaluation on their antiplatelet aggregation and antioxidant activities.
31755304|a|As part of our continuing efforts to discover structurally interesting bioactive phthalide derivatives, 23 of them with a structure incorporating thiophen or halogens were designed and synthesized, 17 of which are previously unreported. In vitro antiplatelet aggregation activity screening showed that 14b could significantly inhibit platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid, compared with edaravone (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, oxidative damage models using SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells induced by H2O2 were built to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the phthalide derivatives. In SH-SY5Y cells, compared with aspirin, 1a significantly increased the relative cell survival rate (p < 0.05). Compared with edaravone, 1a (p < 0.01) and 15b (p < 0.05) significantly increased the relative cell survival rate. In PC12 cells, 1a (p < 0.01), 15b (p < 0.01), and 12a (p < 0.05) remarkably increased the cell survival rate compared with edaravone. The present study identified lead structures to develop potential anti-ischemic stroke agents.

31747095|t|Assessor- and participant-blinded, randomized controlled trial of dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation plus body acupuncture for neuropsychiatric sequelae of stroke.
31747095|a|AIM: Acupuncture has benefits in the rehabilitation of neuropsychiatric sequelae of stroke. This study was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation plus body acupuncture (DCEAS+BA) in treating poststroke depression (PSD), functional disability, and cognitive deterioration. METHODS: In this assessor- and participant-blinded, randomized controlled trial, 91 stroke patients who initially had PSD were randomly assigned to either DCEAS+BA (n = 45) or minimum acupuncture stimulation as controls (n = 46) for three sessions per week over 8 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome was baseline-to-end-point change in score of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale for depressive symptoms, the Barthel Index for functional disability, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for cognitive function. RESULTS: DCEAS+BA-treated patients showed strikingly greater end-point reduction than MAS-treated patients in scores of the three symptom domains. The clinical response rate, defined as an at least 50% baseline-to-end-point reduction in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, was markedly higher in the DCEAS+BA-treated group than that of controls (40.0% vs 17.4%, P = 0.031). Incidence of adverse events was not different in the two groups. Subgroup analysis revealed that DCEAS+BA with electrical stimulation on forehead acupoints was more apparent in reducing Barthel-Index-measured disability than that without electrical stimulation. CONCLUSION: DCEAS+BA, particularly with electrical stimulation on forehead acupoints, reduces PSD, functional disability, and cognitive deterioration of stroke patients. It can serve as an effective rehabilitation therapy for neuropsychiatric sequelae of stroke.

31618056|t|Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Apraxia of Speech and Cortical Activation in Patients With Stroke: A Randomized Sham-Controlled Study.
31618056|a|Purpose The study aims to investigate, using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (A-tDCS), over which site, the left lip region of primary motor cortex (M1) or the Broca's area, there would be better recovery from apraxia of speech (AoS) in patients with poststroke aphasia and to examine for altered activation in speech-related areas after tDCS with nonlinear electroencephalography (EEG). Method Fifty-two patients with AoS were randomized into A-tDCS over the left M1 (A-tDCS-M1), Broca's area, and sham tDCS groups who underwent 10 sessions of tDCS and speech treatment for 5 days. The EEG nonlinear index of approximate entropy was calculated for 6 subjects in each group before and after treatment. Results After treatment, the change in speech-language performance improved more significantly in the A-tDCS-M1 group than the other 2 groups (p < .05). EEG approximate entropy indicated that both A-tDCS groups could activate the stimulated sites; the improvement in the A-tDCS-M1 group was correlated with high activation in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and Broca's areas of the left hemisphere in addition to the stimulated site. Conclusion A-tDCS over the left M1 can improve the speech function in patients with poststroke aphasia and severe AoS and excite and recruit more areas in the motor speech network.

31733648|t|Astrocytic endothelin-1 overexpression promotes neural progenitor cells proliferation and differentiation into astrocytes via the Jak2/Stat3 pathway after stroke.
31733648|a|BACKGROUND: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is synthesized and upregulated in astrocytes under stroke. We previously demonstrated that transgenic mice over-expressing astrocytic ET-1 (GET-1) displayed more severe neurological deficits characterized by a larger infarct after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). ET-1 is a known vasoconstrictor, mitogenic, and a survival factor. However, it is unclear whether the observed severe brain damage in GET-1 mice post stroke is due to ET-1 dysregulation of neurogenesis by altering the stem cell niche. METHODS: Non-transgenic (Ntg) and GET-1 mice were subjected to tMCAO with 1 h occlusion followed by long-term reperfusion (from day 1 to day 28). Neurological function was assessed using a four-point scale method. Infarct area and volume were determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetra-zolium chloride staining. Neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and migration in subventricular zone (SVZ) were evaluated by immunofluorescence double labeling of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), Ki67 and Sox2, Nestin, and Doublecortin (DCX). NSC differentiation in SVZ was evaluated using the following immunofluorescence double immunostaining: BrdU and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN), BrdU and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Phospho-Stat3 (p-Stat3) expression detected by Western-blot and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: GET-1 mice displayed a more severe neurological deficit and larger infarct area after tMCAO injury. There was a significant increase of BrdU-labeled progenitor cell proliferation, which co-expressed with GFAP, at SVZ in the ipsilateral side of the GET-1 brain at 28 days after tMCAO. p-Stat3 expression was increased in both Ntg and GET-1 mice in the ischemia brain at 7 days after tMCAO. p-Stat3 expression was significantly upregulated in the ipsilateral side in the GET-1 brain than that in the Ntg brain at 7 days after tMCAO. Furthermore, GET-1 mice treated with AG490 (a JAK2/Stat3 inhibitor) sh owed a significant reduction in neurological deficit along with reduced infarct area and dwarfed astrocytic differentiation in the ipsilateral brain after tMCAO. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that astrocytic endothelin-1 overexpression promotes progenitor stem cell proliferation and astr ocytic differentiation via the Jak2/Stat3 pathway.

31754406|t|Effects of hydrokinesitherapy on balance and walking ability in stroke survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.
31754406|a|Background: Balance and walking impairment are common dysfunctions after stroke. Emerging data has demonstrated that hydrokinesitherapy may have a positive influence on improvement of balance and walking ability. However, there is no firm evidence to support these results. Therefore, the aim of this review is to evaluate the effects of hydrokinesitherapy in stroke survivors systematically. Methods: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were systemic searched from their inception to Septemter 30, 2018. RevMan 5.3 software was used to perform data synthesis. The fixed-effect model or random-effect model was employed according to the results of heterogeneity test. The mean differences (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to evaluate the pooled effect of hydrokinesitherapy on balance function, walking ability and activty of daily life (ADL). Results: A total of 13 studies were included involving 381 stroke survivors. Meta-analysis results indicated that hydrokinesitherapy could improve balance ability based on three test: Berg balance scale (BBS: MD = 3.84, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.84 to 4.86, P < 0.001), Time Up To Go Test (TUGT: MD = - 1.22, 95% CI - 2.25 to - 0.18, P = 0.02, fixed-effect model), Functional Reach Test (FRT: MD = 2.41, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.33, P < 0.001). Additionally, we found a weakly positive effect on walking speed (SMD = 0.75, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.25, P = 0.003) and walking ability test (SMD = 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.68, P = 0.03). There was no significant difference between experimental group and control group in terms of ADL. Short conclusion: Hydrokinesitherapy can improve balance function and had a weakly positive effect on walking ability in stroke survivors. We did not find sufficient evidence to indicate that hydrokinesitherapy could improve the ADL of stroke survivors. However, due to the methodological shortcoming and small number of included studies, caution is needed when interpreting these results. Due to imprecision and publication bias, the quality of the evidence was downgraded to "low-quality" for the primary outcomes of balance and walking ability. Trial registration: CRD42018110787.

31720990|a|Damaged vascular endothelial cells after ischemic stroke release inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, which could trigger platelet adhesion to vascular endothelial cells and platelet activation, and accelerate thrombus formation. Tetramethylpyrazine is the main bioactive component of Chuanxiong, which has demonstrated considerable protective effects in cerebrovascular diseases. However, the effect and mechanisms of tetramethylpyrazine on platelet adhesion to ischemia/reperfusion-injured endothelial cells have not been elucidated. In this study, we established an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) injury model to investigate the protective effects of tetramethylpyrazine on platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and potential mechanisms. Experimental results showed that tetramethylpyrazine inhibited platelets adhesion to BMECs, alleviated expression of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules on BMECs, and protected BMECs injured by OGD/R. Furthermore, tetramethylpyrazine could inhibit P38 MAPK and NF-κB activation in injured BMECs by OGD/R and inhibition of P38 MAPK with SB303580 and NF-κB with Bay-11-7082 attenuated the reduction of platelets adhesion to BMECs by tetramethylpyrazine. In conclusion, tetramethylpyrazine protected BMECs and inhibited platelets adhesion to BMECs after OGD/R injury, which was partially mediated by inhibiting P38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.

31705448|t|Efficacy of Acupuncture Combined with Local Anesthesia in Ischemic Stroke Patients with Carotid Artery Stenting: A Prospective Randomized Trial.
31705448|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of electro-acupuncture (EA) or transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on perioperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neurological function in ischemic stroke (IS) patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS). METHODS: In total, 124 consecutive IS patients were randomly allocated to the EA, TEAS, and sham groups (groups A, T, and S; 41, 42, and 41 cases, respectively) by software-derived random-number sequence. Groups A and T received EA and TEAS, respectively, at the Shuigou (GV 26) and Baihui (GV 20), Hegu (LI4) and Waiguan (TE 5) acupoints. Group S received sham EA. The stimulation was started from 30 min before surgery until the end of the operation. The primary outcome was the CBF at 30 min after surgery, which was measured by transcranial Doppler sonography. The secondary outcomes included hyperperfusion incidence and neurological function. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and General Evaluation Scale (GES) scores were recorded at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Mean CBF velocity at 30 min after surgery in groups A and T was much lower than that in Group S (P < 0.05); the incidence of hyperperfusion in Groups A and T was also lower than that in group S (P <0.05). Acupuncture was an independent factor associated with reduced incidence of hyperperfusion (OR=0.042; 95% CI: 0.002-0.785; =0.034). NIHSS and GES scores improved significantly at 1 week postoperatively in Groups A and T than in Group S (P < 0.05). Relative to Group S, groups A and T exhibited significantly lower incidences of moderate pain, as well as higher incidences of satisfaction with anesthesia, at 1 day postoperatively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EA or TEAS administered in combination with local anesthesia during CAS can inhibit transient increases in CBF, reduce the incidence of postoperative hyperperfusion, and improve neurological function.

31701353|t|Salidroside Restores an Anti-inflammatory Endothelial Phenotype by Selectively Inhibiting Endothelial Complement After Oxidative Stress.
31701353|a|Salidroside, an active component of Rhodiola rosea, reduces inflammation and neuronal damage after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with reperfusion, partly by inhibiting cerebral complement C3 activation. However, the mechanisms of this inhibition are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated which cerebral cells might contribute to the inhibition of complement by salidroside and the consequences of this inhibition. We used human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC) as a model of cerebral endothelium and found that salidroside prevented the increases of C3 and its active fragment C3a, and the associated increases in C1q and C2, otherwise caused by oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by restoration (OGD/R). However, salidroside did not affect C1q, C2 or C3 in astrocytes and microglial BV2 cells after OGD/R. Salidroside also prevented the decreases in CD46 and CD59, and the increases in VCAM-1, ICAM-1, P-selectin and E-selectin caused by OGD/R in HUVEC, which were associated with decreasing LDH release and increasing Bcl-2/Bax ratio. None of these effects of salidroside occurred in the absence of oxygen-glucose restoration. Moreover, salidroside and C3a receptor antagonist reduced the markers of endothelial activation and neutrophil adhesion to HUVEC after OGD/R to similar extents, and their effects were not additive. Correspondingly, salidroside reduced the markers of endothelial activation and neutrophilic infiltration in the rat brains after MCAO with reperfusion. These results suggest endothelium is an important locus of inhibition of complement by salidroside, restoring an anti-inflammatory endothelial phenotype after oxidative stress, partly by inhibiting classical complement activation and partly by increasing CD46 and CD59, in association with anti-apoptotic effects. These endothelial effects may contribute to the protection afforded by salidroside in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

31691373|t|Ginkgolide B protects human pulmonary alveolar epithelial A549 cells from lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses by reducing TRIM37-mediated NF-κB activation.
31691373|a|The treatment options for acute stroke combined with pulmonary infection are limited. Clinically, there are several therapies to promote blood circulation and dissipate blood stasis; these treatment options include ginkgolide B (GB), which has PAF (platelet activating factor) inhibiting effects. PAF-receptor (PAF-R) antagonists are used to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases, however, the potential of PAF-R antagonists as a treatment for lung infections remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to investigate the protective effect of GB on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in A549 human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) in vitro. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. TRIM37, Caspase-3, and NF-κBp65 expression levels were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting. The release of TNF-α and IL-1β was measured by ELISA. The data indicates that GB may reduce TRIM37 expression by antagonizing the PAF-R pathway, thereby inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and alleviating the inflammatory response of alveolar epithelial cells. This study is the first to provide insight into the therapeutic potential of GB and suggests that clinical application of GB in acute stroke combined with pulmonary inflammation may be efficacious.

31772561|t|Intermodule Coupling Analysis of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du Decoction on Stroke.
31772561|a|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du Decoction (HLJDD) is a "Fangji" made up of well-designed Chinese herb array and widely used to treat ischemic stroke. Here we aimed to investigate pharmacological mechanism by introducing an inter-module analysis to identify an overarching view of target profile and action mode of HLJDD. Stroke-related genes were obtained from OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). And the potential target proteins of HLJDD were identified according to TCMsp (Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform). The two sets of molecules related to stroke and HLJDD were respectively imported into STRING database to construct the stroke network and HLJDD network, which were dissected into modules through MCODE, respectively. We analyzed the inter-module connectivity by quantify "coupling score" (CS) between HLJDD-modules (H-modules) and stroke-modules (S-module) to explore the pharmacological acting pattern of HLJDD on stroke. A total of 267 stroke-related proteins and 15 S-modules, 335 HLJDD putative targeting proteins, and 13 H-modules were identified, respectively. HLJDD directly targeted 28 proteins in stroke network, majority (16, 57.14%) of which were in S-modules 1 and 4. According to the modular map based on inter-module CS analysis, H-modules 1, 2, and 8 densely connected with S-modules 1, 3, and 4 to constitute a module-to-module bridgeness, and the enriched pathways of this bridgeness with top significance were TNF signaling pathway, HIF signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, through this bridgeness, H-modules 2 and 4 cooperatively work together to regulate mitochondrial apoptosis against the ischemia injury. Finally, the core protein in H-module 4 account for mitochondrial apoptosis was validated by an in vivo experiment. This study has developed an integrative approach by inter-modular analysis for elucidating the "shotgun-like" pharmacological mechanism of HLJDD for stroke.

31720730|t|Systematic quality evaluation of Peiyuan Tongnao capsule by offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography/quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry and adjusted parallel reaction monitoring of quality markers.
31720730|a|Peiyuan Tongnao capsule (PTC) is a prescription medicine of traditional Chinese medicine with the effects of "nourishing the kidney," "replenishing essence," "extinguishing wind," and "opening the meridian". PTC is also widely used in clinic for the treatment of stroke and chronic cerebral circulation insufficiency. However, the quality control studies of PTC are hitherto quite limited. Here, we aim to fully utilize an advanced chromatography-mass spectrometry hyphenation technique to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the quality of PTC. Firstly, a two-dimensional liquid chromatography/quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (2D-LC/Q-Orbitrap-MS) approach was established for multicomponent characterization. An offline 2D-LC system fitted with an Xbridge Amide column and an HSS T3 column showed an orthogonality of 0.63 and a theoretical peak capacity of 6930. Eleven fractions of PTC, after hydrophilic interaction chromatography (first dimension), were further analyzed by reversed-phase ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/Q-Orbitrap-MS (UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap-MS, second dimension) using a rapid negative/positive switching mode. Consequently, 178 compounds were separated, 96 of which were identified or tentatively characterized. Secondly, co-condition fingerprint analysis of seven constituted herbal medicines of PTC was performed to unveil ten active ingredients (citric acid, rehmannioside D, echinacoside, paeoniflorin, verbascoside, liquiritin, 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside, cinnamic aldehyde, glycyrrhizic acid, and emodin) as the quality markers of PTC. Thirdly, a UHPLC/PRMad (adjusted parallel reaction monitoring) method was established and validated to quantify the ten marker compounds in 14 batches of PTC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report comprehensive multicomponent characterization, authentication, and quality evaluation of PTC, which could be used to lay the foundation for quality control, biological efficacy research, and further development.

31865728|t|The influence of Tongqiao Huashuan Decoction on the expression of VEGF and EphB2 in MCAO model rats.
31865728|a|BACKGROUND: To observe the effect of Miao medicine and Tongqiao Huashuan Decoction on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and ephrin-B2 (EphB2) in the frontal lobe of the involved side and the cerebellum of rat models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and to reveal the pharmacological mechanism of Tongqiao Huashuan Decoction in treating acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Seventy healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation, model, salvia miltiorrhiza (S. miltiorrhiza), and Miao medicine groups. Modified Longa's method was used to prepare a cerebral ischemia reperfusion model. After the operation, the rats in the sham operation group and model group were intragastrically administered with saline, those in the Miao medicine group were intragastrically administered with Tongqiao Huashuan Decoction, and those in the S. miltiorrhiza group were intraperitoneally injected with S. miltiorrhiza. After 14 days of administration, the neurological deficit scores of the rats in each group were compared before and after treatment. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes of the brain tissues in the right infarcted areas of the rats. VEGF expression in the frontal lobe and cerebellum was observed through immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization to detect EphB2 expression in the frontal lobe and cerebellum. RESULTS: The neurological deficit scores were significantly improved in the Miao medicine and S. miltiorrhiza groups aftertreatment compared with those of the model group (P<0.05) and was higher in the Miao medicine group than in the S. miltiorrhiza group. The VEGF expression in the right frontal lobe and cerebellum was significantly increased in the Miao medicine and S. miltiorrhiza groups (P<0.05) with the former having higher levels than the latter (P<0.05). EphB2 expression was significantly increased in the frontal lobe and cerebellum in the Miao medicine and S. miltiorrhiza groups (P<0.05) and was higher in the frontal lobe of the Miao medicine group than that of the S. miltiorrhiza group (P<0.05) but was not significantly different in the cerebellum in the S. miltiorrhiza and Miao medicine groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Tongqiao Huashuan Decoction can improve the neurological function score and promote the VEGF expression in the frontal lobe and cerebellum and the EphB2 expression in the frontal lobe of the involved side of MCAO rats. The pharmacological mechanism of Tongqiao Huashuan Decoction in treating acute ischemic stroke may be related to its regulation of VEDF and EphB2 expression in the distal part of the involved side.

31570211|t|Body weight support-Tai Chi footwork for balance of stroke survivors with fear of falling: A pilot randomized controlled trial.
31570211|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Balance impairment is the predominant risk factor for falls in stroke survivors. This study examined the effects of body weight support-Tai Chi (BWS-TC) footwork on balance control among stroke survivors with fear of falling (FOF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight stroke survivors with FOF were randomly allocated to either control or BWS-TC groups. Those in BWS-TC underwent Tai Chi training for 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed in all participants by evaluation of the limits of stability test, modified clinical test of sensory integration of balance, fall risk index, and Fugl-Meyer assessment of lower limbs at baseline and 12 weeks. RESULTS: The BWS-TC group displayed significant enhancement in dynamic control and vestibular and somatosensory integration. CONCLUSION: BWS-TC may enhance dynamic control and sensory integration of balance and reduce the risk of fall in stroke survivors with FOF.

31686629|t|Chinese Herbal Medicine Interventions in Neurological Disorder Therapeutics by Regulating Glutamate Signaling.
31686629|a|Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and its signaling is critical for excitatory synaptic transmission. The well-established glutamate system involves glutamate synthesis, presynaptic glutamate release, glutamate actions on the ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors) and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and glutamate uptake by glutamate transporters. When the glutamate system becomes dysfunctional, it contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, such as, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, epilepsy, and ischemic stroke. In this review, based on regulating glutamate signaling, we summarize the effects and underlying mechanisms of natural constituents from Chinese herbal medicines in neurological disorders. Natural constituents from Chinese herbal medicine can prevent the glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity via suppressing presynaptic glutamate release, decreasing ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors expression in the excitatory synapse, and promoting astroglial glutamate transporter expression to increase glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft. However, some natural constituents from Chinese herbal medicine have the ability to restore the collapse of excitatory synapses by promoting presynaptic glutamate release and increasing ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors expression. These regulatory processes involve various signaling pathways, which lead to different mechanistic routes of protection against neurological disorders. Hence, our review addresses the underlying mechanisms of natural constituents from Chinese herbal medicines that regulate glutamate systems and serve as promising agents for the treatment of the above-mentioned neurological disorders.

31602250|t|Safety and efficacy of self-expandable Evolut R vs. balloon-expandable Sapien 3 valves for transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
31602250|a|The aim of this study was to systematically search literature and conduct a meta-analysis comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of Evolut R and Sapien 3 valves for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The PubMed, Biomed Central, Scopus, Cochrane library and Google scholar databases were searched for articles published up to June, 2019. A total of 5 studies were included. In total, 795 patients underwent TAVI with Evolut R, while 665 patients received the Sapien 3 valve in the included studies. Overall device success with Evolut R was 95.7% and with Sapien 3 was 94.2%. Pooled data indicated no significant differences between the 2 valves (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.66-1.89; P=0.68; I2=0%). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of none to mild paravalvular leakage between the 2 groups (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 0.83-3.54; P=0.14; I2=0%). Both mean [random; mean difference (MD) = -3.96; 95% CI, -4.61 to -3.31; P<0.00001, I2=0%] and peak (random; MD = -6.85; 95% CI, -8.22 to -5.48; P<0.00001, I2=0%) aortic valve gradients were significantly lower with Evolut R. No significant differences were observed in the 30-day mortality (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.45-3.87; P=0.62; I2=0%) or 30-day stroke outcomes (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.32-1.81; P=0.54; I2=0%) between the 2 devices. On the whole, the findings of this study indicate that Evolut R and Sapien 3 valves may be comparable in terms of device success and short-term complications. The differences between the 2 devices for post-operative moderate to severe paravalvular leak and permanent pacemaker implantation remain unclear. There is thus a need for a large multi-center randomized controlled trial to provide stronger evidence on this subject.

31390128|t|Comparison of vascular-related diseases in their associations with carotid femoral pulse wave velocity: From the Beijing Vascular Disease Patients Evaluation Study (BEST Study).
31390128|a|AIMS: Carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (CF-PWV) is associated with vascular-related diseases. However, this association has rarely been compared in the same study population, which would improve our understanding of the role of these diseases in developing arteriosclerosis. This study was designed to assess arterial function in different vascular-related diseases and the potential interrelationships between these diseases and arteriosclerosis. METHODS: There were 13 798 participants with or without established vascular-related diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke and peripheral artery disease (PAD), enrolled into the study from 2010 to 2016, comprising 6648 males and 7150 females. The odds ratio (OR) of arteriosclerosis (defined as CF-PWV >12 m/s) in associations with the vascular-related diseases was modelled using multivariable logistic regression analyses to adjust for possible confounders. RESULTS: Compared with participants without vascular-related diseases, those presenting the diseases showed a significantly higher prevalence and age- and sex-adjusted OR of arteriosclerosis (all P < .001). After further adjustment for hypertension, the ORs became much smaller and not significant for CAD or stroke. Compared with apparently healthy participants, participants with each of the diseases showed a significantly higher adjusted OR (range: 2.46-3.30, all P < .001); participants with each vascular-related disease only showed much smaller and non-significant ORs, except for hypertension (OR = 2.73, 95% CI: 2.46, 3.04). After further adjustment for hypertension, these ORs became non-significant (range: 0.81-1.36, all P > .05). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The associations between arteriosclerosis and diseases other than hypertension were largely explained by the association with hypertension, indicating that hypertension could be the single most important factor that leads to arteriosclerosis.

29932353|t|Brain ischemic insult induces cofilin rod formation leading to synaptic dysfunction in neurons.
29932353|a|Ischemic stroke not only induces neuron death in the infarct area but also structural and functional damage of the surviving neurons in the surrounding peri-infarct area. In the present study, we first identified cofilin rod, a pathological rod-like aggregation, formed in neurons of in vivo ischemic stroke animal model and induced neuronal impairment. Cofilin rods formed only on the ipsilateral side of the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO-R) rat brain and showed the highest density in peri-infarct area. Our real-time live cell imaging, immunostaining and patch clamp studies showed that cofilin rod formation in neurons led to dendritic mitochondrial transportation failure, as well as impairment of synaptic structure and functions. Overexpression of LIM kinase or activation of its upstream regulator Rho, suppressed ischemia-induced cofilin rod formation and showed protective effect on synaptic function and structure impairment in both cultured neurons and MCAO-R rat model. In summary, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism of ischemic stroke-induced neuron injury in peri-infarct area and provide a potential target for the protection of neuronal structure and function against brain ischemia insult.

31770254|t|Young male with syphilitic cerebral arteritis presents with signs of acute progressive stroke: A case report.
31770254|a|INTRODUCTION: Neurosyphilis is a chronic infection of the central nervous system that is commonly found in adult with long latency periods. Neurosyphilis-attributed deaths in young patients have grown exponentially in the past decade, yet there have been few studies on the early stages of neurosyphilis. PATIENT CONCERNS: A young male patient with syphilitic cerebral arteritis was evaluated in our clinic for the clinical signs of progressive ischemic stroke. DIAGNOSIS: The progression of syphilitic cerebral arteritis was observed through computed tomography imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiogram, and transcranial color Doppler. The pathological changes and clinical outcomes were reviewed. In this specific case, the development of syphilitic cerebral arteritis was dynamic, continuous, and rapid. The pathogenesis was related to Heubner arteritis, in which the formation of a mural thrombus (MT) causes the severe obstruction of blood flow without complete occlusion, leading to an increased risk of infarction. In this patient, formation of the MT resulted in the infarction of the smaller vessels and narrowing of the larger vessels. The partial dislodgment of the MT from the arterial wall of the larger vessels occluded the smaller vessels, leading to infarction. INTERVENTIONS: Standard pharmacotherapy for the treatment of the cerebral infarction and a single course of penicillin were applied. OUTCOMES: Muscle strength was recovered. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15, whereas the NIH Stroke Scale score was 0. The increase in blood flow of the right MCA was accompanied by severe stenosis with compensation of the anterior communicating artery. In addition, moderate to severe stenosis of the right vertebral artery and the basilar artery was suspected. There was a possibility that the right posterior communicating artery was recruited for compensation. CONCLUSION: Progressive stroke was the initial symptom of the neurosyphilis. Disease progression is rapid and difficult to control with a single course of penicillin.

31725646|t|Theta burst stimulation for upper limb motor dysfunction in patients with stroke: A protocol of systematic review and meta-analysis.
31725646|a|BACKGROUND: Upper limb dysfunction is one of common sequelae of stroke which limits daily activities and decreases quality of life of patients, as well as increasing caregiving burden on families. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is considered to be a beneficial therapy for post-stroke patients with upper limb motor dysfunction, but there is a lack of a high quality evidence. We aim to investigate the effectiveness and safety of TBS for upper limb motor dysfunction in patients with stroke. METHODS: The following databases will be searched: PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine (CBM), China National Knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), Technology Periodical Database (VIP) and WanFang Data from the inception to October 2019. All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using TBS to treat poststroke patients with upper limb motor dysfunction will be included. The primary outcome is Upper Limb Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UL-FMA). Secondary outcomes will include Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Motor Assessment Scale (MAS), Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), Grip strength and other scales evaluating the upper limb motor function. Adverse effects will also be evaluated. Two reviewers will screen studies, extract data and assess the risk of bias of included studies independently. Data analysis will be conducted using Review Manager software (RevMan, version 5.3.5) and R software (version 3.6.1). RESULTS: Our SR will be conducted according to AMSTAR 2.0 and reported in compliance with PRISMA. The findings of this SR will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications or conference presentations. CONCLUSION: Our study will provide evidence for the effectiveness and safety of theta burst stimulation for upper limb motor dysfunction in patients with stroke. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This systematic review (SR) does not require formal ethical approval since no privacy health information will be included. The findings of this SR will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications or conference presentations. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019142462.

31290452|t|Hyodeoxycholic acid protects the neurovascular unit against oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation-induced injury in vitro.
31290452|a|Calculus bovis is commonly used for the treatment of stroke in traditional Chinese medicine. Hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) is a bioactive compound extracted from calculus bovis. When combined with cholic acid, baicalin and jas-minoidin, HDCA prevents hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced brain injury by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptotic signaling. However, the effects of HDCA in ischemic stroke injury have not yet been studied. Neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction occurs in ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of HDCA on the NVU under ischemic conditions in vitro. We co-cultured primary brain microvascular endothelial cells, neurons and astrocytes using a transwell chamber co-culture system. The NVU was pre-treated with 10.16 or 2.54 μg/mL HDCA for 24 hours before exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation for 1 hour. The cell counting kit-8 assay was used to detect cell activity. Flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling were used to assess apoptosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Oxidative stress-related factors, such as superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde and γ-glutamyltransferase, were measured using kits. Pretreatment with HDCA significantly decreased blood-brain barrier permeability and neuronal apoptosis, significantly increased transendothelial electrical resistance and γ-glutamyltransferase activity, attenuated oxidative stress damage and the release of inflammatory cytokines, and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor expression. Our findings suggest that HDCA maintains NVU morphological integrity and function by modulating inflammation, oxidation stress, apoptosis, and the expression of neurotrophic factors. Therefore, HDCA may have therapeutic potential in the clinical management of ischemic stroke. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Experimental Animals of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (approval No. BUCM-3-2016040201-2003) in April 2016.

31290450|t|MK-801 attenuates lesion expansion following acute brain injury in rats: a meta-analysis.
31290450|a|Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of MK-801 and its effect on lesion volume in rat models of acute brain injury. Data Sources: Key terms were "stroke", "brain diseases", "brain injuries", "brain hemorrhage, traumatic", "acute brain injury", "dizocilpine maleate", "dizocilpine", "MK-801", "MK801", "rat", "rats", "rattus" and "murine". PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang database, the VIP Journal Integration Platform (VJIP) and SinoMed databases were searched from their inception dates to March 2018. Data Selection: Studies were selected if they reported the effects of MK-801 in experimental acute brain injury. Two investigators independently conducted literature screening, data extraction, and methodological quality assessments. Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes included lesion volume and brain edema. The secondary outcomes included behavioral assessments with the Bederson neurological grading system and the water maze test 24 hours after brain injury. Results: A total of 52 studies with 2530 samples were included in the systematic review. Seventeen of these studies had a high methodological quality. Overall, the lesion volume (34 studies, n = 966, MD = -58.31, 95% CI: -66.55 to -50.07; P < 0.00001) and degree of cerebral edema (5 studies, n = 75, MD = -1.21, 95% CI: -1.50 to -0.91; P < 0.00001) were significantly decreased in the MK-801 group compared with the control group. MK-801 improved spatial cognition assessed with the water maze test (2 studies, n = 60, MD = -10.88, 95% CI: -20.75 to -1.00; P = 0.03) and neurological function 24 hours after brain injury (11 studies, n = 335, MD = -1.04, 95% CI: -1.47 to -0.60; P < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis suggested an association of reduction in lesion volume with various injury models (34 studies, n = 966, MD = -58.31, 95% CI: -66.55 to -50.07; P = 0.004). Further network analysis showed that 0-1 mg/kg MK-801 may be the optimal dose for treatment in the middle cerebral artery occlusion animal model. Conclusion: MK-801 effectively reduces brain lesion volume and the degree of cerebral edema in rat models of experimental acute brain injury, providing a good neuroprotective effect. Additionally, MK-801 has a good safety profile, and its mechanism of action is well known. Thus, MK-801 may be suitable for future clinical trials and applications.

31872585|t|[Research progress on traditional Chinese medicine in preventing and treating cerebral ischemia injury based on "nose-brain" pathway].
31872585|a|Due to the increasing incidence of central nervous system diseases,especially the increasing incidence and mortality of stroke,brain-targeted drug delivery has attached more and more attention. Nasal administration,as one of the ways of brain-targeted administration,can effectively make the drug delivered to the brain in a targeted way after by passing the blood-brain barrier,providing a new idea for the treatment of central nervous system diseases. Therefore,it is a promising administration way. In recent years,the treatment of encephalopathy by nasal administration of traditional Chinese medicine has become a hot topic in the research of traditional Chinese medicine. Ischemic stroke is one of the most important diseases endangering human health. Nasal administration has a history of thousands of years in treatment of stroke. Modern medical research has proved that there is a subtle connection between the nasal cavity and the brain,and the complex and ingenious structure of the nasal cavity provides the possibility for drugs delivery to the brain through the nose. Drug administration through nasal cavity has obvious advantages in treatment of central nervous system diseases represented by ischemic stroke. Nasal administration is characterized by non-invasion,low infection,rapid absorption and brain targeting. The author will expound the theoretical basis of brain targeting of nasal administration from the aspects of anatomy and physiology,and summarize the transport pathway of drugs through the nose into the brain,the in vitro and in vivo experimental research basis of the " nose-brain"pathway,and the clinical nasal administration of traditional Chinese medicine to prevent cerebral ischemia. It provides a reference for better research of drugs to prevent and treat cerebral ischemia injury through the " nose-brain"pathway and lays a foundation for further research of the " nose-brain" pathway.

31652450|t|Houshiheisan promotes angiogenesis via HIF-1α/VEGF and SDF-1/CXCR4 pathways: in vivo and in vitro.
31652450|a|RATIONALE: Houshiheisan (HSHS), a classic prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has remarkable efficacy in the treatment of ischemic stroke. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pro-angiogenic effect and molecular mechanism of HSHS for stroke recovery. METHODS AND RESULTS: The rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model was constructed by suture method, HSHS (5.25 or 10.5 g/kg) and Ginaton (28 mg/kg) treatment was intragastrically administrated at 6 h after modeling which remained for 7 consecutive days. Pathological evaluation conducted by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and the results showed that HSHS alleviated blood vessel edema, reduced the damage to blood vessels and neurons in the ischemic areas. Immunostaining, quantitative real-time fluorescence PCR results showed that HSHS up-regulated pro-angiogenic factors including platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31)), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), while down-regulated angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and cxc chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression in infarct rat cortex, and similar results were obtained in subsequent Western blot experiment. Furthermore, CCK8 assay and transwell migration assay were performed to assess cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. The medicated serum (MS) of HSHS appeared to have beneficial effects for immortalized human umbilical vein cells (Im-HUVECs) on proliferation and migration after persistence hypoxia. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), VEGFA, Ang-1, Ang-2, and CXCR4 were significantly up-regulated while Ang-2 was down-regulated by HSHS MS treatment compared with vehicle group in vitro. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests a novel application of HSHS as an effective angiogenic formula for stroke recovery.

31653216|t|Efficacy of acupuncture in the management of post-apoplectic aphasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
31653216|a|BACKGROUND: Aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of scalp, tongue, and Jin's 3-needle acupuncture for the improvement of postapoplectic aphasia. METHOD: PubMed, Cochrane, Embase databases were searched using index words to identify qualifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Meta-analyses of odds ratios (OR) or standardized mean differences (SMD) were performed to evaluate the outcomes between investigational (scalp / tongue / Jin's 3-needle acupuncture) and control (traditional acupuncture; TA and/or rehabilitation training; RT) groups. RESULTS: Thirty-two RCTs (1310 participants in investigational group and 1270 in control group) were included. Compared to TA, (OR 3.05 [95% CI: 1.77, 5.28]; p<0.00001), tongue acupuncture (OR 3.49 [1.99, 6.11]; p<0.00001), and Jin's 3-needle therapy (OR 2.47 [1.10, 5.53]; p = 0.03) had significantly better total effective rate. Compared to RT, scalp acupuncture (OR 4.24 [95% CI: 1.68, 10.74]; p = 0.002) and scalp acupuncture with tongue acupuncture (OR 7.36 [3.33, 16.23]; p<0.00001) had significantly better total effective rate. In comparison with TA/RT, scalp acupuncture, tongue acupuncture, scalp acupuncture with tongue acupuncture, and Jin's three-needling significantly improved ABC, oral expression, comprehension, writing and reading scores. CONCLUSION: As treatments to postapoplectic aphasia, scalp / tongue acupuncture and Jin's Three-needling are found better than TA and/or RT in yielding total effective rate and improving ABC, oral expression, comprehension, reading and writing scores.

31657171|t|[Development of research on mechanisms of acupuncture intervention and relationship between astrocyte and ischemic stroke].
31657171|a|Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the central nervous system, which has been demonstrated to be one of the targets for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Many studies have confirmed that acupuncture can effectively regulate astrocyte activity in ischemic stroke through these approaches: repairing astrocyte morphology structure, regu-lating energy metabolism, inhibiting excitotoxicity, inhibiting inflammation response and promoting nerve regeneration. In this paper, the authors summarized the relationship between astrocyte and ischemic stroke, and discussed the mechanisms of acupuncture therapy underlying improvement of ischemic stroke. Additionally, the authors also put forward some suggestions about future researches on acupuncture in ischemic stroke.

31639122|t|Salvianolic Acids for Injection Combined with Conventional Treatment for Patients with Acute Cerebral Infarction: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
31639122|a|BACKGROUND This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of Salvianolic acids for injection (SAFI) plus conventional treatment (CT) for patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI) and to assess the evidence to guide clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and 4 Chinese electronic databases were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The methodological quality of eligible studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The reporting quality of eligible studies was evaluated by Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) for traditional Chinese medicine. Meta-analysis and evidence quality were performed using RevMan 5.3 and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS A total of 14 RCTs involving 1309 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that SAFI plus CT was better than CT alone in improving the total effective rate (RR=1.35, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.44, P<0.00001), reducing the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (130 mg: WMD=-3.31, 95% CI -3.80 to -2.47, P<0.00001; 100 mg: WMD=-1.91, 95% CI -2.28 to -1.54, P<0.00001), improving the activity of daily living and cognitive function of ACI, and improving the hemorheology (HBV: high shear rate blood viscosity, LBV: low shear rate blood viscosity, PV: plasma viscosity) and C-reactive protein (CRP). CONCLUSIONS SAFI plus CT in the treatment of ACI can improve the total effective rate, neurological deficit, and ability to perform activities of daily living, and there is no serious adverse reaction. Based on the GRADE system, the evidence quality is low. More large-scale, well-designed, and high-quality RCTs are required to confirm the positive results.

31772687|t|Baseline Serum sLOX-1 Concentrations Are Associated with 2-Year Major Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events in Patients after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.
31772687|a|Background: Soluble lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (sLOX-1) may be a potential biomarker of coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke. Objective: We aimed to investigate the association and prognostic value of elevated sLOX-1 concentrations with regard to long-term major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in patients with CAD undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: A total of 1011 patients were enrolled. Serum sLOX-1 concentrations were detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients were followed for 2 years. Multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curve were explored to assess the association between sLOX-1 and MACCEs. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of sLOX-1. Results: Two-year MACCEs were associated with serum sLOX-1 concentrations (HR 1.278, 95% CI 1.019-1.604, P = 0.034), left main disease (HR 2.938, 95% CI 1.246-6.925, P = 0.014), small-caliber stents used (HR 2.207, 95% CI 1.189-4.095, P = 0.012), and total stent length (HR 1.057, 95% CI 1.005-1.112, P = 0.030). Serum sLOX-1 concentration ≥ 1.10 ng/ml had maximum sensitivity and specificity in predicting the occurrence of 2-year MACCEs (P < 0.001). Patients with higher serum sLOX-1 concentrations showed a significantly higher incidence of MACCEs in the Kaplan-Meier curve (P < 0.001). The combination of any of the risk factors identified in multiple Cox regression was associated with a stepwise increase in MACCE rate (P < 0.001). Conclusions: High baseline serum sLOX-1 concentration predicts 2-year MACCEs and shows an additional prognostic value to conventional risk factors in patients after primary PCI. sLOX-1 determination might play a complementary role in the risk stratification of patients with CAD treated with PCI.

31610480|t|The profiling and identification of the absorbed constituents and metabolites of Naoshuantong capsule in mice biofluids and brain by ultra- fast liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry.
31610480|a|Naoshuantong capsule (NSTC) is an oral traditional Chinese medicine formula used widely in the clinic for ischemic stroke. The absorbed ingredients and metabolites of NSTC have never been reported before. In this study, a method incorporating rapid resolution liquid chromatography with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to identify absorbed ingredients and metabolites after oral administration of NSTC. A total of 15 constituents were detected and identified as prototypes of NSTC. 109 metabolites related to catechin, gallic acid, paeoniflorin, chlorogenic acid, protocatechuate, typhaneoside, β-elemene, calycosin were identified in serum, urine and brain. 19 metabolites of typhaneoside, 3 metabolites of β-elemene, 12 metabolites of calycosin were reported for the first time. This is the first time to explore the absorption and metabolism of NSTC. The work will provide helpful information for further research of the mechanism and application of NSTC.

31680944|t|Efficacy and Safety of NaoShuanTong Capsule in the Treatment of Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis.
31680944|a|Background: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide. The NaoShuanTong capsule (NSTC), a traditional Chinese patent medicine, has been extensively used in the treatment of stroke in China. However, the clinical efficacy and safety of this treatment has not been statistically and systematically verified by any comprehensive pooled analysis. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NSTC in the treatment of IS. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of NSTC in the treatment of IS conducted before September 2018 were retrieved from five databases, according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two investigators independently reviewed the included studies and extracted relevant data. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using criteria from the Cochrane Handbook, and analyzed using Review Manager 5.3 software. Results: Thirteen RCTs comprising a total of 1,360 participants were included in this study. NSTC was shown to significantly improve the overall response rate (OR = 3.04, 95% CI [1.76, 5.26], P < 0.00001), and neurological function (NSTC increased Modified Barthel Index (MD = 8.15, 95% CI [3.79, 12.52], P = 0.0005), Functional Independence Measure (MD = 29.61, 95% CI [10.11, 49.10], P = 0.003) and European Stroke Scale scores (MD = 8.51, 95% CI [7.00, 10.01], P = 0.03). In addition, NSTC significantly increased serum adiponectin level (MD = 0.66, 95% CI [0.23, 1.08], P = 0.002). Moreover, NSTC reduced atherosclerotic plaque area (MD = -2.24, 95% CI [-4.02, -0.46], P = 0.01) and intima-media thickness (MD = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.13, -0.05], P < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between NSTC treatment and conventional therapy with respect to Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (MD = 10.59, 95% CI [-1.78, 22.96], P = 0.09) or Crouse score (MD = -0.78, 95% CI [-1.79, -0.22], P = 0.13). Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis showed that NSTC exhibits efficacy in the treatment of cerebral infarction. NSTC can improve the overall response rate and neurological function, increase blood adiponectin, reduce neurological deficits, and decrease atherosclerotic plaque area.

31636538|t|Role of Exosomes in Central Nervous System Diseases.
31636538|a|There are many types of intercellular communication, and extracellular vesicles are one of the important forms of this. They are released by a variety of cell types, are heterogeneous, and can roughly be divided into microvesicles and exosomes according to their occurrence and function. Of course, exosomes do not just play a role in cell-to-cell communication. In the nervous system, exosomes can participate in intercellular communication, maintain the myelin sheath, and eliminate waste. Similarly, exosomes in the brain can play a role in central nervous system diseases, such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), prion disease, and traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), with both positive and negative effects (such as the transfer of misfolded proteins). Exosomes contain a variety of key bioactive substances and can therefore be considered as a snapshot of the intracellular environment. Studies have shown that exosomes from the central nervous system can be found in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral body fluids, and that their contents will change with disease occurrence. Because exosomes can penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) and are highly stable in peripheral circulation, they can protect disease-related molecules well and therefore, using exosomes as a biomarker of central nervous system diseases is an attractive prospect as they can be used to monitor disease development and enable early diagnosis and treatment optimization. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge of exosomes, and introduce their pathophysiological roles in different diseases of the central nervous system as well as their roles and applications as a viable pathological biomarker.

31166115|t|Acupuncture attenuates cognitive impairment, oxidative stress and NF-κB activation in cerebral multi-infarct rats.
31166115|a|BACKGROUD: Patients with multiple infarct dementia (MID) have subtle deficits that commonly go unnoticed, and are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Oxidative stress induced by ischaemic injury results in intracellular calcium accumulation and neuronal apoptosis, leading to cognitive impairment by triggering various cellular signal transduction pathways. Several studies have suggested that NF-κB in the presence of p53 has a pro-apoptotic function in various models, but the mechanism is unclear. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate whether acupuncture could protect cognitive function against cerebral multi-infarction (CMi) induced oxidative stress by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and its target gene p53. METHODS: An animal model of CMi was established by injecting homologous blood emboli into the right internal carotid artery of male Wistar rats. After 2 weeks of acupuncture treatment, cognitive function was detected by novel object recognition. Electron spin resonance and Fluo-3 fuorescence imaging were used to test the generation of ROS and intracellular calcium accumulation, respectively. Expression of NF-κB and p53 was examined by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: CMi induced spatial learning and memory impairment, overproduction of intracellular hydroxyl radicals, and elevations of Ca2+, which were ameliorated by verum acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture inhibited activation of NF-κB and its downstream target gene p53. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that acupuncture could protect cognitive function against oxidative stress induced by CMi, which is partially associated with suppression of NF-κB-p53 activation.

31398598|t|Natural neuroprotective alkaloids from Stephania japonica (Thunb.) Miers.
31398598|a|Modulating inflammatory responses after stroke can prevent brain injury and, therefore, improve neurological outcome. Stephania japonica (Thunb.) Miers is a Chinese folk medicine with the function of dispelling the "wind and blockage" in the human body according to the Chinese medicine theory, in which the symptoms of stroke are caused by the "wind and blockage" in the body. In this paper, we for the first time linked S. japonica to stroke by clarifying fifteen alkaloidal constituents including five undescribed (1-5) ones and screening out six hasubanan type alkaloids (1-4, 7, 15) that elicited stronger anti-neuroinflammatory activities than the positive drug. Moreover, the total alkaloid fraction (ASJ) with previously undescribed 3 as the main component was subject to the in vivo evaluation of the protective effect in the MCAO-induced brain injury. The results showed that ASJ exhibited potent protective effect against brain injury in the MCAO rat model. The results reported in this paper suggested that the hasubanan alkaloids from S. japonica would be an important molecular source for discovering novel therapeutic agents for neuroinflammation-related diseases, such as stroke diseases.

31566916|t|From clinical appearance to accurate management in acute ischemic stroke patients: With the guidance of innovative traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis.
31566916|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between simplified classification and laboratory indicators in patients with acute ischemic stroke, also provide accurate evidences for simplified classification and guide clinical interventions and treatment. METHODS: Two hundred patients with acute ischemic stroke were classified into four types according to the characteristics of Traditional Chinese Medicine syndrome: phlegm-heat syndrome, phlegm-dampness syndrome, qi deficiency syndrome, and yin deficiency syndrome. The differences between the types of syndromes and the correlation between laboratory indicators and syndromes were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 200 patients with acute ischemic stroke, there were significant differences in the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) (p < .05) between patients with phlegm-heat syndrome and other three types. There were significant differences in the levels of homocysteine (HCY) and fibrinogen (Fib) between patients with yin deficiency syndrome and other three types (p < .05). In addition, there were statistically significant differences in blood glucose (Glu), glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA1c), and total cholesterol (CHO) between phlegm-heat syndrome and qi deficiency syndrome (p < .05). There were significant differences in the levels of Glu, HBA1c, D-2 polymer (D-D), and C-reactive protein (CRP)s between patients with phlegm-heat syndrome and phlegm-dampness syndrome (p < .05). There were statistically significant differences in the levels of CRP and urea nitrogen between patients with yin deficiency syndrome and phlegm-dampness syndrome and qi deficiency syndrome (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The four-type simplified classification of Integrated TCM and Western medicine in acute ischemic stroke has specific laboratory data to support. Simplified classification with TCM treatment and intervention of different patients improves the survival and treatment, which is an innovative, easy-to-master clinical diagnosis and treatment model.

31368195|t|Hypoxic preconditioning improves the survival and neural effects of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells via CXCL12/CXCR4 signalling in a rat model of cerebral infarction.
31368195|a|The treatment of neural deficiency after cerebral infarction is challenging, with limited therapeutic options. The transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the ischemic penumbra is a potential therapeutic approach. In the present study, a cerebral infarction model was generated by performing middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in SD rats. The expression of CXCR4 increased, and the number of MSCs migrating to the peri-infarct area was higher in rats transplanted with preconditioned MSCs than in rats transplanted with untreated MSCs. The rate of apoptosis, as evaluated by TUNEL staining and immunoblotting assays, was reduced in rats receiving preconditioned MSCs. A significant amelioration of neural regeneration and improved neurological function were observed in rats injected with preconditioned MSCs compared with those injected with untreated MSCs. However, the application of an siRNA targeting CXCL12 significantly inhibited the protective role of preconditioned MSCs against apoptosis and promoted the migration of MSCs to the ischemic area, leading to impaired neuronal regeneration and limited recovery of neuronal function. Hypoxic preconditioning of MSCs prior to transplantation suppressed apoptosis and increased their migration abilities, leading to the promotion of neuronal regeneration and improvement in neural function after transplantation. This preconditioning strategy may be considered as a potential approach for the modification of MSCs prior to cell transplantation therapy in patients with cerebral infarction. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: We found that hypoxic preconditioning of MSCs improved their ability to promote neuronal regeneration and the recovery of neuronal function. Moreover, we showed that CXCR4 inhibited apoptosis, improved cell homing, and promoted neuronal differentiation, without influencing angiogenesis. Our study provides a relatively safe preconditioning method for potential use for cell transplantation therapy in ischemic cerebral infarction. The results presented here will facilitate the development of novel strategies and techniques to improve the tolerance and migration ability of transplanted cells for the treatment of cerebral infarction sequelae.

31519277|t|The add-on effect of dengzhan shengmai capsules on secondary prevention of ischemic stroke: A multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
31519277|a|OBJECTIVE: The Dengzhan Shengmai (DZSM) capsule is a commercially available type of Chinese herbal medicine frequently administered to improve neurological impairment after stroke. Its ability to prevent recurrent stroke, however, has not been determined. This study therefore evaluated the ability of DZSM as an add-on to conventional secondary preventive agents to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at 83 hospitals in Mainland China, 3143 patients in 14-180 days after the initial onset of ischemic stroke, were randomly allocated to the DZSM (0.36 g, twice daily for 12 months) or the placebo group. All patients in both groups received standard secondary preventive medications. The primary outcome was the 1-year incidence of stroke. Between group differences were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analysis showed that 58 (3.8%) participants in the DZSM group and 82 (5.4%) in the placebo group experienced new stroke events (hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% confidence interval = 0.50-0.98, P = 0.036). The type and incidence of adverse events were similar in the DZSM and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of DZSM capsules to standard secondary preventive agents provides additional benefits after the initial onset of ischemic stroke, reducing recurrent stroke without increasing severe adverse events. However, further study is needed to elucidate the role of DZSM on the updated practice of conventional secondary prevention for ischemic stroke.

31572528|t|Sijunzi decoction may decrease apoptosis via stabilization of the extracellular matrix following cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion in rats.
31572528|a|Neurons undergo degeneration, apoptosis and death due to ischaemic stroke. The present study investigated the effect of Sijunzi decoction (SJZD), a type of traditional Chinese medicine known as invigorating spleen therapy, on anoikis (a type of apoptosis) in rat brains following cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion. Rats were randomly divided into sham, model, nimodipine and SJZD low/medium/high dose groups. A middle cerebral artery occlusion model was established. Neurobehavioural scores were evaluated after administration for 14 days using a five-grade scale. Blood-brain barrier permeability and apoptotic rate were detected using Evans blue (EB) extravasation and TUNEL staining, respectively. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and collagen IV (COL IV) were determined using immunohistochemistry. Neurobehavioural scores decreased remarkably in all SJZD and nimodipine groups compared to the model group (P<0.05). Compared with the sham group, EB extravasation was higher in the model group (P<0.01). The amount of EB extravasation decreased in the SJZD high dose and nimodipine groups compared to the model group (P<0.01), and extravasation in the SJZD high dose group was lower than the SJZD low and medium dose groups (P<0.01). TIMP-1 and MMP-9 expression and apoptotic rate increased, but COL IV decreased significantly in the hippocampus of the model group compared to the sham group (P<0.01). TIMP-1 and COL IV expression increased significantly and MMP-9 and apoptotic rate decreased remarkably in all SJZD and nimodipine groups compared to the model group (P<0.01). TIMP-1 and COL IV expression decreased, but MMP-9 expression and apoptotic rate increased in the SJZD low and medium dose groups compared to the SJZD high dose group (P<0.01). SJZD rescued neurons and improved neurobehavioural function in rats following cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion, especially when used at a high dose. The mechanism may be related to protection of the extracellular matrix followed by anti-apoptotic effects.

31230155|t|Salidroside Reduces Inflammation and Brain Injury After Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats by Regulating PI3K/PKB/Nrf2/NFκB Signaling Rather than Complement C3 Activity.
31230155|a|Salidroside, an active constituent of Rhodiola rosea, is neuroprotective after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). However, its effects in other experimental stroke models are less understood. Here, we investigated the effect of daily intraperitoneal injections of salidroside in rats after permanent MCAO (pMCAO). Cerebral infarct volumes at 1 day after pMCAO were significantly reduced by treatment with 100 mg/kg/day salidroside, but not by 25 or 50 mg/kg/day, and this benefit of salidroside increased significantly over at least 7 days of treatment, when it was also accompanied by decreased neurological deficit scores. These observations led us to investigate the underlying mechanism of action of salidroside. 100 mg/kg salidroside for 1 day increased NeuN, Nrf2, and its downstream mediator HO-1, while it reduced nuclear NFκB p50, IL-6, and TNFα. Brusatol, a Nrf2 inhibitor, blocked the actions of salidroside on Nrf2, NFκB p50, IL-6, and TNFα. Salidroside also increased the ratio of p-PKB/PKB at 1 day after pMCAO even in the presence of brusatol. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, prevented all these effects of salidroside, including those on NeuN, p-PKB/PKB, Nrf2, HO-1, and pro-inflammatory mediators. In contrast, salidroside had no significant effect on the level of cerebral complement C3 after pMCAO, or on the activity of C3 as measured by the expression of cerebral Egr1. Our findings therefore suggest that salidroside reduces neuroinflammation and neural damage by regulating the PI3K/PKB/Nrf2/NFκB signaling pathway after pMCAO, and that this neuroprotective effect does not involve modulation of complement C3 activity.

31471773|t|Interactions between clopidogrel and traditional Chinese medicine.
31471773|a|The use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has obtained more and more acceptance all over the world due to its multi-target and multi-level function characteristics. Clopidogrel is a major therapeutic option to reduce atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, recent myocardial infarction, recent stroke or established peripheral arterial disease. These patients probably take TCM. Are there any interactions between clopidogrel and TCM? Whether TCM will affect the efficacy of clopidogrel or increase the adverse reactions of bleeding? Clarifying this information will help physicians make better use of TCM. A literature search was carried out using Web of Science, PubMed and the Cochrane Library to analyze the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions of clopidogrel and TCM. Some herbs can increase the AUC or Cmax of clopidogrel, such as Scutellarin, Danggui, Gegen, Sauchinone and Dengzhan Shengmai capsules. Whereas others can decrease clopidogrel, for example, Ginkgo and Danshen. Furthermore, some herbs can increase the AUC or Cmax of clopidogrel active metabolite, including Ginkgo and Xuesaitong tablet. And others can decrease the clopidogrel active metabolite, such as Scutellarin, Danshen, Fufang Danshen Dripping Pill and Dengzhan Shengmai capsules. Additionally, Schisandra chinensis, Danggui, Gegen and Fufang Danshen Dripping Pill can decrease the AUC or Cmax of the clopidogrel inactive metabolite, while Curcumin on the contrary. The pharmacodynamics of Panax notoginseng, Notoginsenoside Ft1, Hypericum perforatum, Shexiang baoxin pills, Naoxintong capsule increased the antiplatelet activity compared with clopidogrel alone, while Danshen decreased the platelet inhibition. In adverse reactions, Danggui can enhance the adverse effects of clopidogrel on the bleeding time. With more awareness and understanding on potential drug-herb interactions of clopidogrel and TCM, it may be possible to combine clopidogrel with TCM herbs to yield a better therapeutic outcome.

31651893|t|How to continue lipid-lowering therapy in patients with coronary heart disease and severe liver dysfunction?: A case report of plaque regression by a combination of Chinese and Western Medicine.
31651893|a|RATIONALE: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD), atherosclerotic stroke and peripheral vascular disease, has become the most deadly chronic noncommunicable disease throughout the world in recent decades, while plaque regression could reduce the occurrence of ASCVD. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used for prevention and treatment of these diseases. In the perspective of TCM, phlegm and blood stasis are considered to be leading pathogenesis for CHD. Hence, activating blood circulation and dissipating phlegm, which is of great benefit to regress plaque, have been regarded as general principles in treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 36-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of intermittent exertional chest pain. Coronary angiography revealed 60% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Liver function showed: alanine transaminase (ALT):627U/L, aspartate transaminase (AST):243U/L. DIAGNOSES: CHD and hepatitis B with severe liver dysfunction. INTERVENTIONS: The patient should have been treated with high-intensity statin therapy. Actually, due to severe liver dysfunction, Huazhirougan granule instead of statins was administered. In addition, he was treated with TCM according to syndrome differentiation for two and a half years. OUTCOMES: The chest pain disappeared and other symptoms alleviated as well after treatment. Coronary computed tomographic angiography revealed no stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. ALT and AST level returned to normal (ALT:45U/L,AST:24U/L). LESSONS: For patients with CHD and severe hepatic dysfunction, antilipidemic drugs such as statins are not recommended. This case suggested that TCM might fill a gap in lipid-lowering therapy. Thus, we could see that statins were not the only drug for plaque regression and the effect of TCM in treating coronary artery disease cannot be ignored.

31626084|t|Poststroke depression and risk of recurrent stroke: A meta-analysis of prospective studies.
31626084|a|BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been reported on the association of poststroke depression with recurrent stroke events. This meta-analysis of prospective studies aims to evaluate whether poststroke depression is an independent predictor of stroke recurrence among stroke patients. METHODS: A systematic search of articles in PubMed and Embase databases from their inception to October 2018 was conducted. Prospective studies reporting risk estimates of stroke recurrence by depression status in stroke patients were included and pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of stroke recurrence was calculated for patients with or without poststroke depression. RESULTS: Six studies with 4648 stroke patients were finally included, and the prevalence of poststroke depression was found to from 15.9% to 40.5%. The pooled adjusted RR for stroke recurrence in patients suffering from poststroke depression was 1.48 (1.22-1.79) in a fixed-effect model. Subgroup analyses indicated that poststroke depression significantly increased stroke recurrence (RR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.28-2.10) among ischemic stroke patients but not in total stroke patients (RR 1.28; 95% CI, 0.96-1.73). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that poststroke depression may be an independent predictor of stroke recurrence among ischemic stroke patients. Further studies are required to investigate whether treatment of poststroke depression can reduce the risk of stroke recurrence.

31394195|t|Altered Brain Glucose Metabolism Assessed by 18F-FDG PET Imaging Is Associated with the Cognitive Impairment of CADASIL.
31394195|a|Recurrent stroke and cognitive impairment are the primary features of patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The cognitive deficits in these patients are known to be correlated with structural brain changes, such as white matter lesions and lacunae, and resting-state functional connectivity in brain networks. However, the associations between changes in brain glucose metabolism based on 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cognitive scores in CADASIL patients remain unclear. In the present study, 24 CADASIL patients and 24 matched healthy controls underwent 18F-FDG PET imaging. Brain glucose metabolism was measured in all subjects and Pearson's correlation analyses were performed to evaluate relationships between abnormal glucose metabolism in various brain areas and cognitive scores. Compared to controls, CADASIL patients exhibited significantly lower metabolism in the right cerebellar posterior lobe, left cerebellar anterior lobe, bilateral thalamus and left limbic lobe. Additionally, hypermetabolism was observed in the left precentral and postcentral gyri. Importantly, glucose metabolism in the left limbic lobe was positively associated with cognitive scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Furthermore, glucose metabolism in the left precentral gyri was negatively correlated with cognitive scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The present findings provide strong support for the presence of altered brain glucose metabolism in CADASIL patients as well as the associations between abnormal metabolism and cognitive scales in this population. The present findings suggest that patterns of brain glucose metabolism may become useful markers of cognitive impairment in CADASIL patients.

31323277|t|Electroacupuncture ameliorates neuronal injury by Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy clearance in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
31323277|a|The accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria induced by the impairment of the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP), especially mitophagy is an important cause of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Electroacupuncture (EA) exerts remarkable effects in treating ischemic stroke; however, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this study, rats were treated with mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening inhibitor, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) scavenger, or selective inhibitor of mitophagy activation during 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 h of reperfusion in combination with EA treatment. RNA-Seq analysis showed that EA treatment in cerebral I/R was linked to the autophagosome, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and metabolic pathways. We found that I/R resulted in significantly mitochondrial function impairments including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP levels, aggregation of damaged mitochondria, excessive nitro/oxidative stress, PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated ALP dysfunction and deficiency of Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy clearance. The treatment with EA, cyclosporine-A (CsA, a potent inhibitor of mPTP opening) or FeTMPyP (a type of ONOO- scavenger) could significantly increase MMP and/or ATP levels, improve mitochondrial function and decrease neuronal injury. At the same time, EA also improved ALP dysfunction and the deficiency of mitophagy clearance; however, mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1, a selective inhibitor of mitophagy activation) blocked mitophagy clearance and aggravated neuronal injury. Taken together, EA ameliorates nitro/oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial functional damage and decreases the accumulation of damaged mitochondria via Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy clearance to protect cells against neuronal injury in cerebral I/R.

31554644|t|Targeting Foam Cell Formation in Atherosclerosis: Therapeutic Potential of Natural Products.
31554644|a|Foam cell formation and further accumulation in the subendothelial space of the vascular wall is a hallmark of atherosclerotic lesions. Targeting foam cell formation in the atherosclerotic lesions can be a promising approach to treat and prevent atherosclerosis. The formation of foam cells is determined by the balanced effects of three major interrelated biologic processes, including lipid uptake, cholesterol esterification, and cholesterol efflux. Natural products are a promising source for new lead structures. Multiple natural products and pharmaceutical agents can inhibit foam cell formation and thus exhibit antiatherosclerotic capacity by suppressing lipid uptake, cholesterol esterification, and/or promoting cholesterol ester hydrolysis and cholesterol efflux. This review summarizes recent findings on these three biologic processes and natural products with demonstrated potential to target such processes. Discussed also are potential future directions for studying the mechanisms of foam cell formation and the development of foam cell-targeted therapeutic strategies.

31176667|t|IMM-H004 therapy for permanent focal ischemic cerebral injury via CKLF1/CCR4-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
31176667|a|Chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) is a potential target for ischemic stroke therapy. The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been postulated to mediate inflammatory responses during ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The compound IMM-H004 is a novel coumarin derivative that can improve cerebral I/R injury. This study aims to investigate the effects of IMM-H004 on ischemia stroke injury and further elucidate the molecular mechanisms. The standard pMCAO model of focal ischemia was used in this paper. Drugs were administered at 6 hours after ischemia, and behavioral assessment, euthanasia, and outcome measures were evaluated at 9 hours after ischemia. The effects of IMM-H004 on ischemic stroke injury were determined using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, behavioral tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Nissl staining. Immunohistologic staining, immunofluorescence staining, quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR), western blotting, and coimmunoprecipitation (CO-IP) assays were used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. IMM-H004 treatment provided significant protection against ischemia stroke through a CKLF1-dependent anti-inflammatory pathway in rats. IMM-H004 downregulated the amount of CKLF1 binding with C-C chemokine receptor type 4, further suppressing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the following inflammatory response, ultimately protecting the ischemic brain. This preclinical study established the efficacy of IMM-H004 as a potential therapeutic medicine for permanent cerebral ischemia. These results support further efforts to develop IMM-H004 for human clinical trials in acute cerebral ischemia, particularly for patients who are not suitable for reperfusion therapy.

30465328|t|From Analysis of Ischemic Mouse Brain Proteome to Identification of Human Serum Clusterin as a Potential Biomarker for Severity of Acute Ischemic Stroke.
30465328|a|Ischemic stroke is a devastating neurological disease that can cause permanent brain damage, but to date, few biomarkers are available to reliably assess the severity of injury during acute onset. In this study, quantitative proteomic analysis of ischemic mouse brain detected the increase in expression levels of clusterin (CLU) and cystatin C (CST3). Since CLU is a secretary protein, serum samples (n = 70) were obtained from acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients within 24 h of stroke onset and together with 70 matched health controls. Analysis of CLU levels indicated significantly higher levels in AIS patients than healthy controls (14.91 ± 4.03 vs. 12.79 ± 2.22 ng/L; P = 0.0004). Analysis of serum CST3 also showed significant increase in AIS patients as compared with healthy controls (0.90 ± 0.19 vs. 0.84 ± 0.12 ng/L; P = 0.0064). The serum values of CLU were also positively correlated with the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, the time interval after stroke onset, as well as major stroke risk factors associated with lipid profile. These data demonstrate that elevated levels of serum CLU and CST3 are independently associated with AIS and may serve as peripheral biomarkers to aid clinical assessment of AIS and its severity. This pilot study thus contributes to progress toward preclinical proteomic screening by using animal models and allows translation of results from bench to bedside.

The lipidomics data were processed with the OPLS-DA model to find out the lipid regulation effect of Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma combined with Chuanxiong Rhizoma on ischemic stroke. The results showed that Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Chuanxiong Rhizoma decoction lyophilized powder can significantly alleviate brain lipidomics profiles in middle cerebral artery occlusion model rats. Eleven differential lipid metabolites in ischemic stroke model were identified. In this experiment,the protective effects of Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Chuanxiong Rhizoma decoction lyophilized powder on cerebral ischemia injury was verified,which might be related to the regulation of abnormal lipid metabolism.

31771734|t|[Autophagy mechanism of cerebral ischemia injury and intervention of traditional Chinese medicine].
31771734|a|OBJECTIVE: Autophagy is a process of degrading the damaged organelles and macromolecules by lysosomes in cells, which belongs to the programmed cell death. Cerebral ischemia is one of the important reasons for activation of autophagy. Studies have showed that autophagy plays a protective role in neuronal death induced by ischemia. However, it has also been found that excessive activation of autophagy could aggravate cerebral ischemia injury. In recent years, more and more Chinese medicine has been proved to regulate the autophagy level of brain neurons and reduce cerebral ischemia injury. In this paper, the main molecular mechanism of autophagy in the process of cerebral ischemic injury and the intervention effects of Chinese herbs on autophagy arereviewed in order to explore the basic principle of regulating autophagy by Chinese herbs and to play a better role in the clinical treatment of cerebral ischemic diseases.

31662991|t|Cell Chromatography-Based Screening of the Active Components in Buyang Huanwu Decoction Promoting Axonal Regeneration.
31662991|a|Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD), a popular formulation prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of ischemic stroke, has been reported to have a potential role in promoting axonal regeneration. The purpose of the study was to screen and identify bioactive compounds from BHD using live PC12 cells coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Using this approach, we successfully identified six bioactive components from BHD. These components have protective effects on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury to PC12 cells. Furthermore, calycosin-7-d-glucoside (CG) and formononetin-7-O-β-d-glucoside (FG) could upregulate the protein expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This study suggests that living cells combined with HPLC-MS/MS can be used for the screening of active ingredients in TCMs.

31562288|t|Prevalence and prognosis significance of cardiovascular disease in cancer patients: a population-based study.
31562288|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a heavy burden on cancer patients worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and influence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and CVD on the all-cause mortality among Chinese cancer patients. RESULTS: Overall, 13.0% of all cancer patients had at least one type of CVRFs and 5.0% with CVDs. Patients with CVRF or CVD presented more frequently at later stages and received higher percentage of oncotherapy. During 1,782,527 person-years of follow-up, the all-cause mortality in cancer patients with CVDs and with CVRFs was higher compared with those without (182.6/1000, 109.5/1000 and 93.3/1000 person-years, respectively). Cox regression analysis showed that patients with heart failure (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.61-1.99), myocardial infarction (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.16-1.95), atrial fibrillation (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.53), stroke (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11-1.32), hypertension (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.16) and diabetes (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08-1.24) had increased all-cause mortality, whereas dyslipidemia patients had better prognosis (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64-0.83). Stratified by cancer type, the prognostic impact of specific CVRF or CVD varied. METHODS: We consecutively recruited 710,170 cancer patients between Feb. 1995 and Jun. 2018. A stratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the effect of comorbidities on the overall survival of patients stratified by cancer type. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients are vulnerable to comorbidity related to heart and cerebral disease. The influence of comorbidities on prognosis is noticeable and specific both for the type of cancer and comorbidities.

31611791|t|Neuroprotective Effects and Mechanisms of Zhenlong Xingnao Capsule in In Vivo and In Vitro Models of Hypoxia.
31611791|a|Zhenlong Xingnao Capsule (ZXC) is a Tibetan medicine used to treat ischemic stroke. In this study, we determined the in vitro and in vivo effects of ZXC on reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a mouse BV-2 microglial cell hypoxia-reoxygenation and rat middle cerebral artery occlusion infarction models. We aimed to clarify the role of ZXC in cerebral ischemia protection; reveal amino acid neurotransmitter changes in the frontal cortex after drug intervention; determine mRNA and protein expression changes in Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, P38, and nuclear factor (NF)-кB in the frontal cortex and changes in antioxidant indices in the brain; and elucidate the mechanisms underlying ZXC action. After hypoxia-reoxygenation, ROS levels were significantly increased in BV-2 cells, and their levels decreased after treatment with ZXC. ZXC had protective effects on ischemic/anoxic injury in vitro and in vivo by downregulating the expressions of caspase-3 and NF-кB mRNA during ischemia and reperfusion and that of p38 and caspase-3 during acute ischemia and reperfusion as well as the steady-state levels of excitatory amino acids/inhibitory amino acids and by improving the total antioxidant capacity and total superoxide dismutase activities during ischemia. These findings provide new molecular evidence for the mechanisms underlying ZXC action.

31547018|t|HMGB1-triggered inflammation inhibition of notoginseng leaf triterpenes against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury via MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.
31547018|a|Ischemic stroke is a clinically common cerebrovascular disease whose main risks include necrosis, apoptosis and cerebral infarction, all caused by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury. This process has particular significance for the treatment of stroke patients. Notoginseng leaf triterpenes (PNGL), as a valuable medicine, have been discovered to have neuroprotective effects. However, it was not confirmed that whether PNGL may possess neuroprotective effects against cerebral I/R injury. To explore the neuroprotective effects of PNGL and their underlying mechanisms, a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was established. In vivo results suggested that in MCAO/R model rats, PNGL pretreatment (73.0, 146, 292 mg/kg) remarkably decreased infarct volume, reduced brain water content, and improved neurological functions; moreover, PNGL (73.0, 146, 292 mg/kg) significantly alleviated blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inhibited neuronal apoptosis and neuronal loss caused by cerebral I/R injury, while PNGL with a different concertation (146, 292 mg/kg) significantly reduced the concentrations of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1 β, and HMGB1 in serums in a dose-dependent way, which indicated that inflammation inhibition could be involved in the neuroprotective effects of PNGL. The immunofluorescence and western blot analysis showed PNGL decreased HMGB1 expression, suppressed the HMGB1-triggered inflammation, and inhibited microglia activation (IBA1) in hippocampus and cortex, thus dose-dependently downregulating inflammatory cytokines including VCAM-1, MMP-9, MMP-2, and ICAM-1 concentrations in ischemic brains. Interestingly, PNGL administration (146 mg/kg) significantly downregulated the levels of p-P44/42, p-JNK1/2 and p-P38 MAPK, and also inhibited expressions of the total NF-κB and phosphorylated NF-κB in ischemic brains, which was the downstream pathway triggered by HMGB1. All of these results indicated that the protective effects of PNGL against cerebral I/R injury could be associated with inhibiting HMGB1-triggered inflammation, suppressing the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB, and thus improved cerebral I/R-induced neuropathological changes. This study may offer insight into discovering new active compounds for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

31530654|t|Efficacy and safety of rescue stenting following failed mechanical thrombectomy for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion: propensity score analysis.
31530654|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rescue stenting (RS) after failed mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for patients with large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation. METHODS: Consecutive patients who experienced failed reperfusion and subsequently did or did not undergo RS at 16 comprehensive stroke centers were enrolled from January 2015 to June 2018. Propensity score matching was used to achieve baseline balance between the patient groups. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) at 48 hours and the modified Rankin Scale scores and mortality at 3 months in the two groups were compared. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients with RS and 117 patients without RS after failed MT were enrolled. Propensity score matching analysis selected 132 matched patients. The good outcome rate was significantly higher in matched patients with RS than in those without RS (36.4% vs 19.7%, p=0.033), whereas the sICH (13.6% vs 21.2%, p=0.251) and mortality (31.9% vs 43.9%, p=0.151) were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: RS seems to be an effective safe choice for patients with large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation who underwent failed MT.

31265843|t|Anticoagulant effect of wogonin against tissue factor expression.
31265843|a|Tissue factor (TF) is the primary cause of atherothrombosis, the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques with subsequent thrombosis, leading to acute cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Wogonin (Wog) is an active component of Scutellaria baicalensis, used for inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, and hyperlipidemia. The anticoagulant effect of Wog on TF expression remains unexplored. In this study, we have investigated the effects of Wog on TF gene expression and its underlying molecular mechanism in human vascular endothelial cells (ECs). We found that Wog dose-dependently inhibited PMA-enhanced TF mRNA, protein, and activity in ECs. This inhibition was attributed to its decreasing nuclear accumulations of transcription factors, phospho-c-Jun and early growth response-1(Egr-1), not nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), through blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Reduction by Wog of Egr-1 nuclear level and Egr-1/DNA binding activity was associated with its inhibition of Egr-1 de novo synthesis. Wog as well as inhibitors to ERK and JNK suppressed TF promoter activity and protein expression in reporter gene and Western blot analyses. Furthermore, it also exhibited anticoagulant function by inhibiting TF expression and activity in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated ECs and THP-1 cells. These results suggest that Wog inhibits ERK/Egr-1- and JNK/AP-1-mediated transactivation of TF promoter activity, leading to downregulation of TF expression and activity induced by inflammatory mediators. Wog targeting pathological TF expression without affecting its basal level may be a safer templet in the development of anticoagulant agent for cardiovascular thrombotic diseases related to atherothrombosis.

31125596|t|Mass spectrometry-based urinary metabolomics for the investigation on the mechanism of action of Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. & Maxim.) Maxim. leaves against ischemic stroke in rats.
31125596|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: As a traditional Chinese medicine, Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. & Maxim.) Maxim. leaves (ESL) can treat ischemic, neurasthenia, and hypertension diseases. However, only few studies have been conducted on the mechanism of action of ESL for ischemic disease treatment. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to discover the potential biomarkers in the rats caused by ischemic stroke and build a gene-enzyme-biomarker network to explore the mechanism of ESL treatment on ischemic stroke further. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The urinary metabolomics strategy was developed by combining UPLC-Q-TOF/MS with multivariate data analysis. The gene-enzyme-biomarker network was built by Cytoscape 3.6.0 on the basis of the potential biomarkers filtered out via urinary metabolomic analysis. Then, the potential target enzymes of ESL in the treatment of ischemic stroke were selected for further validation analysis via the ELISA kits. RESULTS: A total of 42 biomarkers associated with ischemic stroke have been identified, among which 38 species can be adjusted by ESL, including 5'-methylthioadenosine, prostaglandin A2, l-methionine, aldosterone, 11b-hydroxyprogesterone, prostaglandin E3, dehydroepiandrosterone, taurine, 5-methoxyindoleacetate, and p-cresol glucuronide. These biomarkers were involved in several metabolic pathways, including taurine and hypotaurine, arachidonic acid, cysteine and methionine, steroid hormone biosynthesis, tryptophan, and tyrosine metabolism pathways. The gene-enzyme-biomarker network was built, and three predicted target proteins, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), monoamine oxidase (MAO), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), were selected as the potential target enzymes for ESL in ischemic stroke treatment. CONCLUSIONS: All results showed that ESL can play a therapeutic role in treating ischemic stroke through different pathways. This study will provide an overall view of the mechanism underlying the action of ESL against ischemic stroke.

31572219|t|Herbal Compatibility of Ginseng and Rhubarb Exerts Synergistic Neuroprotection in Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury of Rats.
31572219|a|Objective: Ischemic stroke is a complex multifactorial disease caused by interactions among polygenetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors with limited effective treatments. Multi-herbal formulae have long been used for stroke through herbal compatibility in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM); however, there is still a lack of evidence due to their unimaginable complexity. Herbal pairs represent the simplest and basic features of multi-herbal formulae, which are of great significance in clarifying herbal compatibility. Here, we aim to investigate the neuroprotective effects of the herbal compatibility of Ginseng and Rhubarb on a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury model of rats. Methods: Male adult SD rats were randomly divided into a sham group, a normal saline (NS) group, a Ginseng group, a Rhubarb group, and a Ginseng + Rhubarb (GR) group, a Carbenoxolone [CBX, gap junction (GJ) specific inhibitor] group, and a GR + CBX group. Each group was further assigned into four subgroups according to ischemic time (6 h, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days). The cerebral I/R injury model was established according to the modified Zea Longa method. The Neurological Deficiency Score (NDS) was assessed by the Zea-Longa scale; the cerebral infarction area was detected by TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining; and the expression of connexin-43 (Cx43) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) were detected based on an immunofluorescence technique and quantitative real-time-PCR. Results: Compared to the I/R group, both the independent and combined use of Ginseng and Rhubarb can significantly improve NDS (P < 0.05), decrease the percentage of the cerebral infarction area around the infarction penumbra (P < 0.05) and down-regulate the expression of Cx43 and AQP4 after I/R injury (P < 0.05). The GR had more significant effects than that of Ginseng and Rhubarb (P < 0.05). Compared with the GR group, the GR + CBX group significantly improved in NDS (P < 0.05), and decreased the percentage of the cerebral infarction area (P < 0.05) and expression of Cx43 and AQP4 protein (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The herbal compatibility of Ginseng and Rhubarb synergistically exerts neuroprotective function during acute cerebral I/R injury, mainly through reducing the expression of Cx43 and AQP4.

31515682|t|Electroacupuncture ameliorates learning and memory deficits via hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors and the PKA signaling pathway in rats with ischemic stroke.
31515682|a|Hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors and the PKA signaling pathway have been implicated in learning and memory. This study aimed to investigate whether PKA signaling mediated by 5-HT1A receptors was involved in the electroacupuncture (EA)-mediated learning and memory in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced cognitive deficit (MICD). Compared to no treatment or non-acupoint EA treatment, EA at DU20 and DU24 acupoints improved the neurological deficit of scores, shortened escape latency and increased the frequency of crossing the platform in the Morris water maze test. T2-weighted imaging demonstrated that the MICD rat brain lesions were mainly located in the cortex and hippocampus, and injured volumes were reduced after EA. Furthermore, we found that these behavioral changes were concomitant with the deficit of the 5HT1A and PKA signaling pathways in the hippocampus, as the activation of the 5-HT1A receptor, the reduction of PKA kinase activity, and AMPA and NMDA receptor phosphorylation occurred in the injured hippocampus at Day 14 after MICD. Additionally, EA dramatically elevated the activation of PKA. Moreover, EA significantly increased intracellular calcium concentrations regulated by the activation of NMDA receptors. Therefore, PKA kinase and NMDA receptors mediated by 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus might contribute to improving learning and memory during the recovery process following ischemic stroke with an EA intervention.

31505740|t|Therapeutic Potential of Pien-Tze-Huang: A Review on Its Chemical Composition, Pharmacology, and Clinical Application.
31505740|a|Pien-Tze-Huang (PTH) is a famous and commonly used traditional Chinese medicine formula in China. It was first formulated by a royal physician of the Ming Dynasty (around 1555 AD). Recently, PTH has attracted attention worldwide due to its beneficial effects against various diseases, especially cancer. This paper systematically reviewed the up-to-date information on its chemical composition, pharmacology, and clinical application. A range of chemical compounds, mainly ginsenosides and bile acids, have been identified and quantified from PTH. Pharmacological studies indicated that PTH has beneficial effects against various cancers, hepatopathy, and ischemic stroke. Furthermore, PTH has been used clinically to treat various diseases in China, such as colorectal cancer, liver cancer, and hepatitis. In summary, PTH is a potential agent with extensive therapeutic effects for the treatment of various diseases. However, the lack of information on the side effects and toxicity of PTH is a non-negligible issue, which needs to be seriously studied in the future.

31494833|t|Stroke Center Care and Outcome: Results from the CSPPC Stroke Program.
31494833|a|The aim of this study was to assess the association between admission to stroke centers for acute ischemic stroke and complications and mortality during hospitalization in a Chinese population by means of an observational study using data from the China Stroke Center Data-Sharing Platform. We compared in-hospital complications and mortality for patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke (N = 13,236) between November 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018 at stroke center (SH) and non-stroke center (CH) hospitals using distance to hospitals as an instrumental variable to adjust for potential prehospital selection bias. The results showed that complication rates during hospitalization among ischemic stroke patients who received thrombolytic therapy (n = 11,203) were lower in the SH group than in the CH group: 11.1% vs 15.7% (absolute difference, - 5.11% [95% CI, - 6.05 to - 3.99%], odds ratio [OR] 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.92]). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was reduced from 4.2 to 3.2%: SH group vs CH group, 3.2% vs 4.2% (absolute difference, - 1.24% [95% CI, - 1.65 to - 0.82%], OR 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.0.98]). Furthermore, the total mortality rate in the SH group was also lower than in the CH group: SH group vs CH group, 2.2% vs 3.0% (absolute difference, - 0.92% [95% CI, - 1.48 to - 0.53%], OR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73 to 0.96]). The data showed that admission to SH hospitals was associated with a lower risk of treatment complications and death for patients with an acute ischemic stroke receiving thrombolytic therapy.

31228802|t|Baicalein administered in the subacute phase ameliorates ischemia-reperfusion-induced brain injury by reducing neuroinflammation and neuronal damage.
31228802|a|Ischemic stroke is a cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity, high mortality, and high disability, representing a serious threat to human life and health. Clinically, the extensive injury caused by ischemic stroke results from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury thrombolytic treatment. However, there are few reports on the use of medications in the subacute stage of cerebral I/R. Baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone) is a biologically active ingredient extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of baicalein administered in the subacute phase of cerebral I/R injury in a rat model of ischemia induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Rats were treated daily with baicalein (200 mg/kg, i.g.) in the subacute phase (24 h after reperfusion) for 7 days. The results showed that baicalein significantly reduced neurobehavioral deficits and decreased brain infarct volume from 18.99% to 7.41%. Immunofluorescence analysis of the ischemic penumbra showed that baicalein significantly reduced expression of the M1 marker, cluster of differentiation (CD) 16 and CD86, and increased expression of the M2 marker, CD 163 and CD206, indicating that baicalein inhibited M1 transformation and promoted M2 transformation of microglia/macrophage to inhibit neuroinflammation. Moreover, baicalein suppressed NF-κB signaling by reducing IκBα phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65, which decreased the release of the pro-inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α. In addition, baicalein reduced phosphorylation of JNK, ERK and p38, which are involved modulation of microglia/macrophage M1/M2 polarization. Western blot analysis of apoptosis- and autophagy-related proteins showed that baicalein increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and reduced caspase-3 expression to decrease neuronal apoptosis and ameliorate neuronal loss. Baicalein also decreased the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and promoted phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway which implied inhibition of autophagy. These observations suggest that baicalein exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing neuroinflammation, apoptosis and autophagy, and protects against cerebral I/R injury in the subacute phase in vivo.

31103697|t|Effectiveness and Safety of Four Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Asian Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation.
31103697|a|BACKGROUND: Whether four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are superior to warfarin in Asian patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) remains unclear. METHODS: This nationwide retrospective cohort study was based on data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from June 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, covering patients with NVAF taking edoxaban (n = 4,577), apixaban (n = 9,952), rivaroxaban (n = 33,022), dabigatran (n = 22,371), and warfarin (n = 19,761). Propensity score weighting was used to balance covariates across study groups. Patients were followed up until occurrence of study outcomes or end date of study. RESULTS: Edoxaban, apixaban, and rivaroxaban were associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism than warfarin. All DOACs had a lower risk of major bleeding than warfarin. Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding than rivaroxaban and dabigatran, whereas the risk of major bleeding was comparable between edoxaban and apixaban. The reduced risks of thromboembolism/major bleeding for the four DOACs persisted in high-risk subgroups, including those with chronic kidney disease, elderly patients (age ≥ 75 years), secondary stroke prevention, or CHA2DS2-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, and female sex) ≥ 4. A total of 2,924 (64%), 6,359 (64%), 31,108 (94%), and 19,821 (89%) patients received low-dose edoxaban (15-30 mg/d), apixaban (2.5 mg bid), rivaroxaban (10-15 mg/d), and dabigatran (110 mg bid), respectively. The effectiveness/safety outcomes with the four low-dose DOACs compared with warfarin were consistent with the main analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest real-world practice study among Asian patients with NVAF, four DOACs were associated with a comparable or lower risk of thromboembolism, and a lower risk of bleeding than warfarin. There was consistency even among high-risk subgroups and whether standard-or low-dose regimens were compared.

31081365|t|User testing of the psychometric properties of pictorial-based disability assessment Longshi Scale by healthcare professionals and non-professionals: a Chinese study in Shenzhen.
31081365|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to validate a novel pictorial-based Longshi Scale for evaluating a patient's disability by healthcare professionals and non-professionals. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Rehabilitation departments from a grade A, class 3 public hospital, a grade B, class 2 public hospital, and a private hospital and seven community rehabilitation centers. SUBJECTS: A total of 618 patients and 251 patients with functional disabilities were recruited in a two-phase study, respectively. MAIN MEASURES: Outcome measure: pictorial scale of activities of daily living (ADLs, Longshi Scale). Reference measure: Barthel Index. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to analyze the validity of Longshi Scale against Barthel Index. RESULTS: In phase 1 study, from March 2016 to August 2016, the results demonstrated that the Longshi Scale was both reliable and valid (intraclass correlation coefficient based on two-way random effect (ICC2,1) = 0.877-0.974 for intra-rater reliability; ICC2,1 = 0.928-0.979; κ = 0.679-1.000 for inter-rater reliability; intraclass correlation coefficient based on one-way random effect (ICC1,1) = 0.921-0.984 for test-retest reliability and Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.836-0.899). In the second phase, in March 2018, results further demonstrated that the Longshi Scale had good inter-rater and intra-rater reliability among healthcare professionals and non-professionals including therapists, interns, and personal care aids (ICC1,1 = 0.822-0.882 on Day 1; ICC1,1 = 0.842-0.899 on Day 7 for inter-rater reliability). In addition, the Longshi Scale decreased assessment time significantly, compared with the Barthel Index assessment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The Longshi Scale could potentially provide an efficient way for healthcare professionals and non-professionals who may have minimal training to assess the ADLs of functionally disabled patients.

31328958|t|Chinese Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture Reduced the Risk of Stroke After Bell's Palsy: A Population-Based Retrospective Cohort Study.
31328958|a|Objectives: Patients with Bell's palsy are more likely to develop stroke than the general population. The therapeutic effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) on the risk of stroke in patients with Bell's palsy is unknown. We investigated the risk of stroke according to TCM use in Bell's palsy patients. Design: Records obtained from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database identified 9,863 patients with Bell's palsy, 238 of whom met study inclusion criteria and were categorized as TCM users (n = 119) or non-TCM users (n = 119). TCM treatment modalities and Chinese herbal medicine prescription patterns were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis determined the risk of stroke. Results: TCM users were at lower risk of stroke compared with non-TCM users (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.59; p < 0.004). In subgroup analyses, patients treated with both TCM and oral steroids were at significantly lower risk of stroke compared with those who used neither (aHR 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.22; p < 0.001). The risk of stroke was also lower among those treated with TCM only (aHR 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.59; p < 0.001) or oral steroids only (aHR 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.39; p < 0.01), compared with patients using neither. Conclusion: TCM therapy may lower the risk of stroke after Bell's palsy. However, the retrospective nature of this study and characteristics of the database limit these observational findings. Our results deserve further verification in large-scale prospective studies.

31021470|t|Suppression of REDD1 attenuates oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-evoked ischemic injury in neuron by suppressing mTOR-mediated excessive autophagy.
31021470|a|Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) typically occurs after mechanical thrombectomy to treat ischemic stroke, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after reperfusion may result in neuronal insult, ultimately leading to disability and death. Regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1 (REDD1) is a conserved stress response protein under various pathogenic conditions. Recent research confirms the controversial role of REDD1 in injury processes. Nevertheless, the role of REDD1 in cerebral I/R remains poorly defined. In the current study, increased expression of REDD1 was observed in neurons exposed to simulated I/R via oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treatment. Knockdown of REDD1 enhanced OGD/R-inhibited cell viability, but suppressed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in neurons upon OGD/R. Simultaneously, suppression of REDD1 also antagonized OGD/R-evoked cell apoptosis, Bax expression, and caspase-3 activity. Intriguingly, REDD1 depression abrogated neuronal oxidative stress under OGD/R condition by suppressing ROS, MDA generation, and increasing antioxidant SOD levels. Further mechanism analysis corroborated the excessive activation of autophagy in neurons upon OGD/R with increased expression of autophagy-related LC3 and Beclin-1, but decreased autophagy substrate p62 expression. Notably, REDD1 inhibition reversed OGD/R-triggered excessive neuronal autophagy. More importantly, depression of REDD1 also elevated the expression of p-mTOR. Preconditioning with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin engendered not only a reduction in mTOR activation, but also a reactivation of autophagy in REDD1 knockdown-neurons upon OGD/R. In addition, blocking the mTOR pathway muted the protective roles of REDD1 inhibition against OGD/R-induced neuron injury and oxidative stress. Together these data suggested that REDD1 may regulate I/R-induced oxidative stress injury in neurons by mediating mTOR-autophagy signaling, supporting a promising therapeutic strategy against brain ischemic diseases.

30989715|t|microRNA-340-5p inhibits hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes by regulating the Act1/NF-κB pathway.
30989715|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play critical roles in the occurrence, progression, and treatment of many cardiovascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanism by which miRNA regulates target gene expression in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not entirely clear. MiR-340-5p was reported to be downregulated in acute ischemic stroke. However, it still remains unknown whether miR-340-5p is mediated in the pathogenesis process of I/R injury after AMI. In the present study, male C57BL/6 J mice and H9C2 cardiomyocytes were used as experimental models. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, Western blot analysis, and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling immunofluorescence staining assay were conducted to examine related indicators in the study. We confirmed that the expression of miR-340-5p is downregulated after I/R in AMI mice and hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R)-induced cardiomyocytes. miR-340-5p could inhibit apoptosis and oxidative stress in H/R-induced H9C2 cells via downregulating activator 1 (Act1). The inhibiting action of miR-340-5p on H/R-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes was partially reversed after Act1 overexpression. Moreover, the results showed that the NF-κB pathway may be mediated in the role of miR-340-5p on H/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress. We demonstrated that upregulation of miR-340-5p suppresses apoptosis and oxidative stress induced by H/R in H9C2 cells by inhibiting Act1. Therapeutic strategies that target miR-340-5p, Act1, and the NF-κB pathway could be beneficial for the treatment of I/R injury after AMI.

31480626|t|Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Gene Expression in Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea Patients.
31480626|a|BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and inflammation may be involved in the early pathogenesis of AD in patients with OSA. However, the potential pathways between OSA and AD have yet to be established. In this study, we aimed to investigate differential expressions of AD-associated genes in OSA patients without evident AD or dementia. METHODS: This prospective case-control study included five patients with severe OSA and five age and sex-matched patients with non-severe OSA without evident dementia who underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015. The expressions of genes associated with AD were analyzed using whole-exome sequencing. Unsupervised two-dimensional hierarchical clustering was performed on these genes. Pearson's correlation was used as the distance metric to simultaneously cluster subjects and genes. RESULTS: The expressions of CCL2, IL6, CXCL8, HLA-A, and IL1RN in the patients with severe OSA were significantly different from those in the patients with non-severe OSA and contributed to changes in the immune response, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation may contribute to the onset of AD and physicians need to be aware of the potential occurrence of AD in patients with severe OSA.

31214923|t|Association of COL4A2 Gene Polymorphisms with Lacunar Stroke in Xinjiang Han Populations.
31214923|a|Recent studies have shown that variants in the COL4A2 genes are associated with sporadic cerebral small vessel disease. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between COL4A2 gene polymorphisms and lacunar stroke in Xinjiang Han populations. The improved multiple ligase detection reaction (iMLDR) method was used to analyze the genotypes of seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the COL4A2 gene (rs3803230, rs391859, rs4103, rs445348, rs76425569, rs7990383, rs9515185) in a case-control study of 406 lacunar stroke patients and 425 controls. The GG genotype of rs3803230 (adjusted OR = 1.303, 95% CI = 1.146-1.480, P < 0.001) and the GA/AA genotype of rs76425569 (adjusted OR = 1.744, 95% CI = 1.306-2.329, P < 0.001) showed significant increases in the risk of lacunar stroke. The G-A haplotype of rs3803230-rs76425569 carried a significant increase in the risk of lacunar stroke (OR = 1.616, 95% CI = 1.292-2.022, P < 0.001). Hypertension stratification analyses demonstrated that the GA/AA genotype of rs76425569 was significantly associated with lacunar stroke in the hypertensive group (adjusted OR = 1.316, 95% CI = 1.083-1.598, P = 0.006). In the non-hypertensive group, the GG genotype of rs3803230 (adjusted OR = 1.584, 95% CI = 1.257-1.997, P < 0.001) and GA/AA genotype of rs76425569 were significantly associated with lacunar stroke (adjusted OR = 1.312, 95% CI = 1.054-1.635, P = 0.015). The TT genotype of rs4103 was significantly associated with lacunar stroke in the non-hypertensive group (adjusted OR = 1.355, 95% CI = 1.152-1.594, P < 0.001). This study demonstrates that the COL4A2 gene could play a role in the pathogenesis of lacunar stroke in the Han population of China.

31207093|t|Metabolite profiling and quantification of phytochemicals of Tianma-Gouteng granule in human and rat urine using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.
31207093|a|Tianma-Gouteng granule has been used for the treatment of hypertension, headache, and stroke in China. However, the metabolism of Tianma-Gouteng granule has not been clear. In the present study, an ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method has been developed for rapid identification of 35 prototypes and 43 metabolites in human and rat urine after single oral administration of Tianma-Gouteng granule. The results showed that glucuronidation and sulfation were the main metabolic pathways for flavonoids, alkaloids, iridoidic glycosides, anthraquinones, phenols, and stilbenes that were found in Tianma-Gouteng granule. Moreover, a validated ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry method was applied for the quantification of 14 compounds in rat urine after an oral administration of Tianma-Gouteng granule (2.5 g/kg). During 0-48 h after dosing, the cumulative excretion rates of nine prototype components were 53% for gastrodin, 0.07∼1.6% for geniposide, baicalin and baicalein, wogonoside, rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline, leonurine, and emodin, indicating that urinary excretion is the major way for gastrodin to eliminate from the body. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of metabolism and excretive kinetics of Tianma-Gouteng granule in human and/or rat, and helpful information for screening of its active components in vivo and clinical application.

31247210|t|Hispidulin exhibits neuroprotective activities against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury through suppressing NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis.
31247210|a|AIM: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the major cause of neurological deficit following stroke. Our previous study showed neuroprotective effects of hispidulin against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). In this study, we further examined the involvement of pyroptosis in this neuroprotective function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IRI was simulated in a rat model by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery, and the animals were treated with different doses of hispidulin. The neurological function of the rats was evaluated by the neural function defect score (NFDS), balance beam test and limb placement test. The infarct volume and brain water content were measured 72 h following IRI. Neuronal cell survival and pyroptosis in the ischemic cortex were respectively detected by Nissl staining and TUNEL assay. The relative expression of pyroptosis markers was determined by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and ELISA as appropriate. IRI was simulated in vitro in primary cerebral astrocytes using the OGD/R procedure. AMPKα was blocked genetically or pharmacologically using siRNA and compound C respectively. CCK-8 and LDH release assays were performed using suitable kits. RESULTS: Hispidulin improved the neurological symptoms of the rats after IRI, in addition to decreasing the infarct size and brain edema. Mechanistically, hispidulin exerted its neuroprotective effects in vivo and in vitro by suppressing NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis by modulating the AMPK/GSK3β signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Hispidulin is a neuroprotective agent with clinical potential against IR-induced neurological injury.

31574813|t|Increased perihematomal neuron autophagy and plasma thrombin-antithrombin levels in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage: An observational study.
31574813|a|Animal studies have demonstrated that autophagy was involved in neuronal damage after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Several studies showed thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) plasma levels were elevated in patients with ICH. In this study, we aimed to evaluate if autophagy occurred in patients with ICH; and the relationship between the severity of brain injury and plasma TAT levels.A novel tissue harvesting device was used during hematoma removal surgery to collect loose fragments of tissue surrounding the affected brain area in 27 ICH patients with hematoma volumes of >30 mL in the basal ganglia. Control tissues were obtained from patients who underwent surgery for arteriovenous malformation (n = 25). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemistry for autophagy-related proteins were used to evaluate the ultrastructural and morphologic cellular characteristics; and the extent of autophagy in the recovered tissue specimens. Stroke severity was assessed by using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure plasma TAT levels.Transmission electron microscopy showed autophagosomes and autolysosomes exist in neurons surrounding the hematoma, but not in the control tissues. The number of cells containing autophagic vacuoles correlated with the severity of brain injury. Immunohistochemistry showed strong LC3, beclin 1, and cathepsin D staining in ICH tissue specimens. Plasma TAT levels correlated positively with autophagic cells and ICH severity (P < .01).Autophagy was induced in perihematomal neurons after ICH. Autophagy and plasma TAT levels correlated positively with severity of brain injury. These results suggest that autophagy and increased plasma TAT levels may contribute to the secondary damage in ICH patients.

31574812|t|Acupuncture for poststroke spasticity: A protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis.
31574812|a|INTRODUCTION: Spasticity is the most common complication after stroke, which is the main obstacle in the recovery of motor function. Spasticity seriously affects the quality of life and brings a heavy burden to families and society. Acupuncture is an effective method for stroke. However, whether acupuncture is effective for poststroke spasticity is still unknown. The purpose of this systematic review (SR) is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for poststroke spasticity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search the following databases from inception to July 2019: China Biology Medicine (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Data, the Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) utilizing acupuncture for poststroke spasticity will be included. The primary outcome is the modified Ashworth scale. Secondary outcomes include composite spasticity scale, clinic spasticity index, electromyographic activity, Hoffmann reflex activity, or other spasticity-related outcomes. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment will be performed independently by 2 reviewers. Assessment of risk of bias and data synthesis will be conducted using Review Manager V5.3 software. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The ethical approval is not required since SR is based on published studies. The results of this SR will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal according to the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019129779.

31574797|t|Prognostic value of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and glycosylated hemoglobin for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients with single concomitant chronic total occlusion following primary percutaneous coronary intervention: A prospective observational study.
31574797|a|To investigate factors predicting the onset of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) for patients with non-ST-segment elevation infarction (NSTEMI) and single concomitant chronic total occlusion (CTO). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) both play essential role in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular homoeostasis. However, current knowledge of its predictive prognostic value is limited.422 patients with NSTEMI and CTO (59.7 ± 12.4 years, 74.2% men) who underwent successful pPCI were enrolled and followed for 2 years. Multivariate cox regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to determine the factors predicting MACCEs.140 patients (33.2%) experienced MACCEs in the follow-up period. Multivariate cox regression analysis found when we process the model with NGAL at admission, low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, HR = 0.963, 95% CI 0.940 to 0.987, P = .003) and fasting blood glucose (HR = 1.078, 95% CI 1.002 to 1.159, P = .044), but not NGAL at admission, were independent predictors of 2 years MACCEs. While HbA1C (HR = 1.119, 95% CI 1.014 to 1.234, P = .025), LVEF (HR = 0.963, 95% CI 0.939 to 0.987, P = .003), estimated glomerular filtration rate (HR = 1.020, 95% CI 1.006 to 1.035, P = .006) and NGAL value 7 day (HR = 1.020, 95% CI 1.006 to 1.035, P = .006) showed their predictive value in another model. ROC analysis indicated NGAL 7 day (AUC = 0.680, P = .0054 and AUC = 0.622, P = .0005) and LVEF (AUC = 0.691, P = .0298 and AUC = 0.605, P = .0021) could predict both in-hospital and 2 years MACCEs, while higher NGAL at admission could only predict poorer in-hospital prognosis (AUC = 0.665, P = .0103). Further analysis showed the prognostic value of NGAL was particularly remarkable among those HbA1C<6.5%.Patients with NSTEMI and single concomitant CTO receiving pPCI with higher NGAL on 7 days during hospitalization are more likely to suffer 2 years MACCEs, particularly in those with lower HbA1C.

31348992|t|Computational systems pharmacology reveals an antiplatelet and neuroprotective mechanism of Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection in the treatment of ischemic stroke.
31348992|a|Herbs are typically prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat complex diseases. The multicomponent nature of herbal drug ingredients makes it difficult to readily understand their mode of action. To decipher their molecular mechanisms, here we proposed a novel computational systems pharmacology based approach, which consisted of transcriptome profiling, data collection, statistical analysis, network algorithm, bioinformatics analysis and pharmacological validation. The network algorithm called signed random walk with restart (SRWR) was used to simulate the propagation of drugs' effects on networks. This algorithm could identify proteins either positively or negatively regulated (activated or inhibited) by drugs on human signaling networks. To establish proof of principle, the herbal product Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection (DZXXI), which exhibits pharmacological effects in ischemic stroke but its mechanism was unclear, was analyzed. Eighty-three targets were predicted with high confidence for DZXXI's active compounds in plasma, and 87 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in MCF7 cells treated with DZXXI. These target genes were further found to be associated with pathways involved in neuronal apoptosis in ischemic stroke, such as NF-κB signaling, TNF signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling. Intersection analysis between DZXXI's putative targets with ischemic stroke-associated genes identified two important targets (PTGS1, PTGS2) corresponding to four DZXXI compounds, which were further validated using in silico and in vitro/vivo models. The most inhibited genes identified by the SRWR algorithm were significantly enriched with ischemic stroke-associated disease genes, antiplatelet associated pathways, and their encoded proteins were enriched in brain, vascular endothelium and platelets. The CMAP analysis based on DEGs suggested that DZXXI could function as both an anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet agent. Taken together, the computational analysis suggested that DZXXI exhibited anti-platelet and neuroprotective effects in the treatment of ischemic stroke. These deductions were preliminarily confirmed by subsequent in vitro/vivo studies. This approach provides a systems perspective to study the relevance between herbal drugs and disease processes, and can reveal possible pharmacological effects of multiple ingredients within herbal product.

31667141|t|Middle cerebral artery thrombus susceptibility-weighted imaging mapping predicts prognosis.
31667141|a|Background: Susceptibility weighted imaging and mapping (SWIM) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to evaluate cerebral arterial thrombosis. The aim of this research was to assess susceptibility, length, and clot burden score (CBS) of thrombus in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and their relationship with cerebral infarction and early clinical prognosis in patients with acute or subacute cerebral infarction. Methods: In total, 56 patients with acute or subacute cerebral infarction (with the time from onset to admission less than 72 h) and only unilateral MCA occlusion were included in the current study. All the patients had the corresponding susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Parameters including susceptibility, length, and CBS of thrombus were obtained from SWI and SWIM. The differences in susceptibility of different portions of the thrombus were compared with each other by one-way ANOVA test. The relationship between susceptibility and stroke onset time was further analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis, in addition to the relationships between susceptibility, length, CBS, diffusion-weighted imaging-Alberta stroke program early CT score (DWI-ASPECTS), and admission and discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Results: The susceptibility among different portions and different segments of thrombus showed no statistical difference. The susceptibility and length were weakly yet negatively correlated with DWI-ASPECTS (rs=-0.382, -0.457; P=0.004, 0.000). The susceptibility was weakly yet positively correlated with admission NIHSS and discharged NIHSS (rs=0.403, 0.430; P=0.002, 0.001). CBS was weakly yet positively correlated with DWI-ASPECTS (rs=0.349; P=0.008) and weakly yet negatively correlated with admission and discharged NIHSS (rs=-0.375, -0.335; P=0.004, 0.012). Conclusions: The susceptibility remained consistent regardless of location, length, and onset time, which indicates that the thrombus composition was similar when detected on SWI less than 72 h from the onset. Susceptibility and CBS may help to predict clinical severity and short-term clinical prognosis to some extent.

31872725|t|[Research advance in chemical compounds,pharmacological action and clinical application of Dengzhan Shengmai Capsules].
31872725|a|Dengzhan Shengmai Capsules( DZSMC),a well-known traditional Chinese medicine( TCM) formula,is comprised of the main drug of Erigeron breviscapus,and supplemented with Panax ginseng,Ophiopogon japonicus and Schisandra chinensis,with functions of supplementing Qi and nourishing Yin,promoting blood circulation and strengthening brain. DZSMC is the only Chinese patent drug with A-level evidence-based medicine in secondary prevention for stroke and ranks first among TCMs for neurological treatment. Modern studies indicate that the chemical constituents of DZSMC mainly include flavonoids,phenolic acids,lignans,saponins and so on. Pharmacological experimental studies have shown that DZSMC has such pharmacological effects as anti-oxidation,anti-inflammatory and anti-myocardial ischemia. DZSMC is mainly used in the convalescent care of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,and is often used in combination with various conventional therapeutic drugs to exert clinical efficacy through brain protection,neuroprotection,etc.,and improve clinical symptoms in patients. In this review,according to domestic and international related literature combined with research results obtained by our project,the research advances in the chemical constituents,pharmacological effects and clinical application of DZSMC have been systematically reviewed and summarized,providing reference and support for further study and secondary development of the formula.

31471437|t|Outcome reporting from clinical trials of non-valvular atrial fibrillation treated with traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine: a systematic review.
31471437|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine variation in outcomes, outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) and measurement times in clinical trials of non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and to identify outcomes for prioritisation in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. DESIGN: This study was a systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Clinical trials published between January 2015 and March 2019 were obtained from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wanfang Database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and SinoMed. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies were considered. Interventions included traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. The required treatment duration or follow-up time was ≥4 weeks. The required sample size was ≥30 and≥50 in each group in RCTs and observational studies, respectively. We excluded trials that aimed to investigate the outcome of complications of NVAF, to assess the mechanisms or pharmacokinetics, or for which full text could not be acquired. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The general information and outcomes, OMIs and measurement times were extracted. The methodological and outcome reporting quality were assessed. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. RESULTS: A total of 218 articles were included from 25 255 articles. For clinical trials of antiarrhythmic therapy, 69 outcomes from 16 outcome domains were reported, and 28 (31.82%, 28/88) outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was ultrasonic cardiogram. Thirty-one outcomes (44.93%, 31/69) were provided definitions or OMIs; the outcome measurement times ranged from 1 to 20 with a median of 3. For clinical trials of anticoagulation therapy, 82 outcomes from 18 outcome domains were reported; 38 (29.23%, 38/130) outcomes were reported only once. The most frequently reported outcome was ischaemic stroke. Forty (48.78%, 40/82) outcomes were provided OMIs or definitions; and the outcome measurement times ranged from 1 to 27 with a median of 8. CONCLUSION: Outcome reporting in NVAF is inconsistent. Thus, developing a COS that can be used in clinical trials is necessary.

31531004|t|MRI Tracking of SPIO- and Fth1-Labeled Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Transplantation for Treatment of Stroke.
31531004|a|We aimed to identify a suitable method for long-term monitoring of the migration and proliferation of mesenchymal stromal cells in stroke models of rats using ferritin transgene expression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) were transduced with a lentivirus containing a shuttle plasmid (pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP) carrying the ferritin heavy chain 1 (Fth1) gene. Ferritin expression in stromal cells was evaluated with western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. The iron uptake of Fth1-BMSCs was measured with Prussian blue staining. Following surgical introduction of middle cerebral artery occlusion, Fth1-BMSCs and superparamagnetic iron oxide- (SPIO-) labeled BMSCs were injected through the internal jugular vein. The imaging and signal intensities were monitored by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in vitro and in vivo. Pathology was performed for comparison. We observed that the MRI signal intensity of SPIO-BMSCs gradually reduced over time. Fth1-BMSCs showed the same signal intensity between 10 and 60 days. SWI showed hypointense lesions in the SPIO-BMSC (traceable for 30 d) and Fth1-BMSC groups. T2WI was not sensitive enough to trace Fth1-BMSCs. After transplantation, Prussian blue-stained cells were observed around the infarction area and in the infarction center in both transplantation models. Fth1-BMSCs transplanted for treating focal cerebral infarction were safe, reliable, and traceable by MRI. Fth1 labeling was more stable and suitable than SPIO labeling for long-term tracking. SWI was more sensitive than T2W1 and suitable as the optimal MRI-tracking sequence.

31475496|t|[Clinical trials of acupuncture treatment of post-stroke shoulder pain].
31475496|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical therapeutic effect of "Tiaoshen Zhitong" (mental regulating and pain relieving) needling and its influence on serological indicators in the treatment of post-stroke shoulder pain, so as to provide new therapeutic thoughts and approach for post-stroke shoulder pain. METHODS: A total of 80 inpatients with post-stroke shoulder pain were randomly divided into a control group (routine needling, 39 cases) and an observation group ("Tiaoshen Zhitong" needling, 41 cases) according to the random number table. Patients of the two groups accepted basic medication treatment including anticoagulants, hypotensive drugs, hypoglycermic drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, etc. In addition, patients of the control group were also treated by routine acupuncture stimulation (uniform reinforcing-reducing stimulation) of Jianyu (LI15), Jianqian (EX-UE12), Jianhou (Extra), Jianliao (TE14), Waiguan (TE5) and Hegu (LI4) on the affected side, and those of the observation group also treated by "Tiaoshen Zhitong" needling of Ear-Shenmen (MA-TF1), bilateral Neiguan (PC6, lifting-thrusting-reducing method), Shuigou (GV26, lifting-thrusting-reducing method), and Jianyu (LI15), Jianliao(TE14), Jianzhen (SI9) and Yanglingquan (GB34, the latter 4 points were stimulated with uniform reinforcing-reducing method) on the affected side. The treatment was given once every day, 6 days a week for 4 weeks. The pain severity was assessed by using visual analogue scale (VAS), the upper limb function evaluated by using Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) scale, the shoulder-joint function evaluated by using Constant-Murley score (CMS) questionnaire, and the daily living ability assessed by using Barthel index (BI) scale. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the contents of serum beta-endorphin (β-EP), enkephalin (ENK) and dynorphin (Dyn). The clinical therapeutic effect was evaluated by using Nimodipine scale method. RESULTS: Of the 39 and 41 cases in the control and observation groups, 7(17.95%) and 12(29.27%) were basically cured, 12(30.77%) and 13(31.71%) experienced marked improvement, 8(20.51%) and 11(26.83%) were effective, 12(30.77%) and 5 (12.19%) failed, with the total effective rate being 69.23% and 87.80%, respectively. The effective rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). After the treatment, the VAS score was obviously reduced (P<0.01), and the scores of FMA scale, CMS questionnaire and BI scale, and contents of serum β-EP, ENK and Dyn were all increased obviously in the two groups compared with their own pre-treatment (P<0.01). The therapeutic effect of "Tiaoshen Zhitong" needling was significantly superior to that of the routine needling in lowering VAS, and in raising scores of FMA scale, CMS questionnaire and BI scale and in up-regulating serum β-EP, ENK and Dyn levels (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: "Tiaoshen Zhitong" needling is effective in reducing post-stroke shoulder pain and improving the motor function of the upper limb and shoulder-joint as well as the quality of daily life in stroke patients with shoulder pain. Its analgesic effect is probably related to the increase of the levels of serum β-EP, ENK and Dyn.

31426765|t|Change of intestinal microbiota in cerebral ischemic stroke patients.
31426765|a|BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota has been suggested to play a role in stroke patients. Nevertheless, little is known about gut microbiota and the clinical indexes in stroke patients. METHODS: Total of 30 cerebral ischemic stroke (CI) patients and 30 healthy control were enrolled in this study and the fecal gut microbiota was profiled via Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA V1-V2. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) were used to quantify stroke severity and modified Rankin scale (mRS) to assess outcome for CI patients. The correlations between the clinical indexes and microbiota were evaluated. RESULTS: Though the microbial α-diversity and structure is similar between CI patients and healthy controls, the gut microbiota of CI patients had more short chain fatty acids producer including Odoribacter, Akkermansia, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_005 and Victivallis. We also found that the special microbes were correlation with serum index, such as norank_O_ _Mollicutes_RF9, Enterobacter, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002 were negative correlation with LDL (r = - 0.401, P < 0.01), HDL (r = - 0.425, P < 0.01) and blood glucose (r = - 0.439, P < 0.001), while the HDL was significantly positive correlation with the genus Ruminococcus_1 (r = 0.443, P < 0.001). The Christensenellaceae_R-7_group and norank_f_Ruminococcaceae was significantly positive correlation with NIHSS1M (r = 0.514, P < 0.05; r = 0.449, P < 0.05) and mRS (r = 0.471, P < 0.05, r = 0.503, P < 0.01), respectively. On the other hand, the genus Enterobacter was significantly negative correlation with NIHSS1M (r = 0.449, P < 0.05) and mRS (r = 0.503, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that CI patients showed significant dysbiosis of the gut microbiota with enriched short chain fatty acids producer, including Odoribacter, Akkermansia. This dysbiosis was correlation with the outcomes and deserves further study.

31443312|t|Improved Survival in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients with Cardiac Arrhythmia by Amiodarone Treatment through Autophagy.
31443312|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy of the liver. In basic studies, the regulation of autophagy has offered promising results for HCC treatment. This study aimed to address the question of whether amiodarone can improve survival rates in HCC patients associated with autophagy. Using datasets from the National Health Insurance Research Database, we enrolled patients over 18 years of age that had been diagnosed with HCC between January 1997 and December 2010. Amiodarone and non-amiodarone users were matched at a 1:1 frequency, according to all variables. Additionally, HepG2 cells treated with amiodarone were evaluated by cell viability and autophagic change. Autophagic signaling was examined by immunoblotting and tissue array immunohistochemistry. Of the 10,946 patients diagnosed with HCC, each cohort included 221 patients after 1:1 propensity score matching. The median survival was 36.70 months for the amiodarone users, and 24.48 months for the non-amiodarone users. After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities and treatment, amiodarone users had a significantly lower risk of mortality. Amiodarone users also demonstrated an improved 3-year survival rate. Furthermore, amiodarone treatment-induced autophagy in HepG2 cells was demonstrated by autophagosome formation associated with increasing LC3B-II, P62, and Beclin-1 expression. Autophagic flux also increased following amiodarone treatment with bafilomycin A1. SiRNA of LC3B knocked down endogenous LC3B formation and restored HepG2 cell viability. This study provides epidemiologic evidence that amiodarone via autophagic degradation machinery may offer survival benefits for HCC patients with a history of arrhythmia. Further randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled trials are warranted for patients with HCC.

31269467|t|Rapid identification and analysis of the active components of traditional Chinese medicine Xiaoxuming decoction for ischemic stroke treatment by integrating UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and RRLC-QTRAP MSn method.
31269467|a|Xiaoxuming decoction (XXMD) is a key Chinese medicine prescription, which has been clinically used for stroke treatment for thousands of years in ancient China. The extracted active fraction of XXMD (AF-XXMD) contains almost pharmacological active components with anti-cerebral ischemic effects. However, the illumination of its complex ingredients remains challenging. In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) and rapid resolution liquid chromatography-triple quad linear ion trap mass spectrometry (RRLC-QTRAP MSn) methods were developed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of AF-XXMD, respectively. Data showed that 48 compounds were identified in AF-XXMD by using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, including 14 alkaloids, 14 flavonoids, 12 triterpenoids, 3 chromones, 3 monoterpenes, 1 cyanide glycoside, and 1 volatile oil. Among them, 38 components were unambiguously characterized by their reference standards. A total of 15 compounds in AF-XXMD were first reported. Additionally, 33 compounds were quantified by using RRLC-QTRAP MSn in AF-XXMD. This developed RRLC-QTRAP MSn method provides an adequate linearity (r2 > 0.99) and intrabatch and interbatch variations (RSD < 15%), with recovery (60.3%-107.5%) of 33 compounds concerned. The total content of 33 compounds in AF-XXMD reached 31.53%. The high total contents of compounds of Xing Ren, Shao Yao, and Huang Qin in AF-XXMD were 9.52%, 8.85%, and 7.62%, respectively. The data further showed that cyanophoric glycosides, monoterpenes, and flavonoids were the three most abundant components in AF-XXMD. Results provide advantageous information for the comprehensive study of the pharmacokinetic features and pharmacological mechanisms of AF-XXMD.

31207256|t|Realgar and cinnabar are essential components contributing to neuroprotection of Angong Niuhuang Wan with no hepatorenal toxicity in transient ischemic brain injury.
31207256|a|Realgar and cinnabar are commonly used mineral medicine containing arsenic and mercury in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Angong Niuhuang Wan (AGNHW) is a representative realgar- and cinnabar-containing TCM formula for treating acute ischemic stroke, but its toxicology and neuropharmacological effects are not well addressed. In this study, we compared the neuropharmacological effects of AGNHW and modified AGNHW in an experimental ischemic stroke rat model. Male SD rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) plus 22 h of reperfusion. Although oral administration of AGNHW for 7 days in the rats increased arsenic level in the blood and liver tissue, there were no significant changes in the arsenic level in kidney, mercury level in the blood, liver and kidney as well as hepatic and renal functions in MCAO rats. AGNHW revealed neuroprotective properties by reducing infarction volume, preserving blood-brain barrier integrity and improving neurological functions against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Interestingly, removing realgar and/or cinnabar from AGNHW abolished the neuroprotective effects. Meanwhile, AGNHW could scavenge peroxynitrite, down-regulate the expression of p47phox, 3-NT and MMP-9 and up-regulate the expression of ZO-1 and claudin-5 in the ischemic brains, which were abolished by removing realgar and/or cinnabar from AGNHW. Notably, realgar or cinnabar had no neuroprotection when used alone. Taken together, oral administration of AGNHW for one week should be safe for treating ischemic stroke with neuroprotective effects. Realgar and cinnabar are necessary elements with synergetic actions with other herbal materials for the neuroprotective effects of AGNHW against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

31485244|t|Application of Meridian Electrical Conductance in the Setting of Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Cross-Sectional Study.
31485244|a|Acupuncture is widely used for improving poststroke care. Knowing the condition of meridian can help traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctors make a tailored choice of acupoints for every patient. The establishment of an objective meridian energy measurement for acute ischemic stroke that can be used for future acupuncture treatment and research is an important area in stroke-assisted therapy. In this study, a total of 102 subjects diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke within 7 days of onset were recruited, and the meridian energy analysis device (MEAD) was used to record the meridian electrical conductance (MEC) values of twelve meridians on unaffected and affected limbs. We found that the MEC value of the twelve meridians on the affected limbs was significantly higher than that on the unaffected limbs (P=0.001). Compared with the unaffected limbs, there was a higher value of MEC on the affected limbs of the lung meridian, heart meridian, pericardium meridian, and small intestine meridian, with significant differences (P < 0.05, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05, respectively). Further analysis revealed that the MEC values of both Yin and Yang meridians of the affected limbs were significantly higher than those of the unaffected limbs (P=0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Meanwhile, the mean of the index of sympathovagal balance in patients with acute ischemic stroke (5.49 ± 4.21) was higher than the normal range (1-1.5), indicating autonomic imbalance. The results of this study are consistent with TCM theory as well as clinical observation and pathological mechanisms, suggesting that the measurement of MEC values may be used as a supplementary diagnostic method for acupuncture in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

31128157|t|Protective effect of gastrodin against methamphetamine-induced autophagy in human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells via the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
31128157|a|Methamphetamine (METH) has been shown to induce neuropathological dysfunction and irreversible brain cell damage. Prior studies indicated the involvement of autophagy in METH-induced neurotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanism by which autophagy contributes to METH-induced neurotoxicity remains elusive. Gastrodin, a primary bioactive constituent of Gastrodia elata-an orchid used in traditional Chinese medicine-is used widely to treat stroke, dementia, and headache. This study investigates whether METH induces autophagy in the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, then examines the neuroprotective effects of gastrodin against autophagy in METH-treated SH-SY5Y cells. The effects of METH on the protein expressions of autophagy-related genes (LC3B and Beclin-1) were evaluated with and without gastrodin. The presence of autophagosomes in the METH-induced treatment with and without gastrodin is revealed through transmission electron microscopy. Pharmacological intervention was employed to study the role of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the gastrodin-mediated neuroprotection against METH-induced autophagy. The present results indicate that METH exposure elevates the protein expression levels of LC3B and Beclin-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Gastrodin is observed to block the METH-induced upregulation of LC3B and Beclin-1 protein expression significantly. Gastrodin is found to exhibit an anti-autophagic effect on the inhibition of the METH-induced Beclin-1 protein expression, partly via the AKT/mTOR These findings may aid the development of a gastrodin-based therapeutic strategy for treating METH-induced neurotoxicity.

31395912|t|Association between Clinical and Laboratory Markers and 5-year Mortality among Patients with Stroke.
31395912|a|Factors influencing long-term stroke mortality have not been comprehensively investigated. This study aimed to identify the baseline clinical, laboratory, demographic/socioeconomic, and hospital factors influencing 5-year mortality in patients with first stroke. Total 3,956 patients with first-stroke hospitalization from 2004 to 2008 were connected to the longitudinal National Health Insurance Research Database. Post-admission baseline data that significantly increased 5-year mortality were red cell distribution width (RDW) >0.145 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.71), hemoglobin <120 g/L (aHR = 1.25), blood sugar <3.89 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)(aHR = 2.57), serum creatinine >112.27 μmol/L (aHR = 1.76), serum sodium <134 mmol/L (aHR = 1.73), body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2 (aHR = 1.33), Glasgow Coma Scale <15 (aHR = 1.43), Stroke Severity Index ≥20 (aHR = 3.92), Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index ≥3 (aHR = 4.21), no rehabilitation (aHR = 1.86), and age ≥65 years (aHR = 2.25). Hemoglobin, RDW, blood sugar, serum creatinine and sodium, BMI, consciousness, stroke severity, comorbidity, rehabilitation, and age were associated with 5-year mortality in patients with first stroke.

31178138|t|Trim47 is a critical regulator of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury through regulating apoptosis and inflammation.
31178138|a|Cerebral ischemia is a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the world. Tripartite motif-47 (Trim47), a member of the TRIM family proteins, has been reported to be involved in apoptosis and inflammation in various types of diseases. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanism of Trim47 in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the role of Trim47 in cerebral I/R injury and the potential underlying mechanisms. The results indicated that Trim47 expression was markedly induced in rats after stroke onset. By the use of genetic approaches, we indicated that Trim47 knockdown significantly reduced the infarct size, mitigated the neurological deficits scores and decreased brain water contents in rats with cerebral I/R injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In addition, Trim47 knockdown-alleviated cerebral I/R was correlated with the suppression of apoptosis through inhibiting Caspase-3 cleavage. Furthermore, reducing Trim47 apparently decreased the release of pro-inflammatory factors, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), in brain samples of MCAO rats, which was partly by the blockage of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. However, Trim47 over-expression markedly accelerated cerebral ischemia injury through promoting apoptosis and inflammation. The suppressive effects of Trim47 knockdown on cerebral I/R were verified in human neuron-like cells stimulated by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Thus, this study demonstrated a new mechanism for the effect of Trim47 on cerebral I/R injury, and targeting Trim47 might provide feasible therapies for stroke treatment.

31364457|t|Traditional Chinese Medicine Use in the Treatment of Acute Heart Failure in Western Medicine Hospitals in China: Analysis From the China PEACE Retrospective Heart Failure Study.
31364457|a|Background Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is used in the treatment of many conditions, including heart failure (HF), although it is not well characterized. Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective analysis of TCM use in a random sample of hospitalizations for HF within a random sample of Western medicine hospitals in China in 2015 using data from the China PEACE 5r-HF (China Patient-Centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events 5 Retrospective Heart Failure Study). We describe the frequency of TCM use and its association with patient characteristics, in-hospital use of evidence-based therapies, and hospital characteristics using hierarchical logistic regression models. Finally, we assessed risk-adjusted in-hospital bleeding and mortality. Among 10 004 patients hospitalized with HF (median age, 73 years; 48.9% women) from 189 hospitals, 74.7% received TCM (83.3% administered intravenously). The most commonly used agent was Salvia miltiorrhiza (51.2%). Patients with coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% CI, 1.53-1.95) or stroke (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15-1.51) were more likely to receive TCM; there was no correlation with evidence-based therapy use. Nearly all hospitals (99.4%) used TCM, with substantial variation across hospitals (median OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 2.82-3.76). In-patient bleeding (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.03-1.88) and mortality (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04-1.79) were higher with Salvia miltiorrhiza, although not with other TCMs. Conclusions In a nationally representative sample of patients hospitalized with acute HF in China, three fourths received TCM. Nearly all hospitals used TCM, although use varied substantially by hospital. Although TCM was not used in lieu of evidence-based therapies for HF, we found a signal for harm with the most commonly used TCM. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

31082455|t|Mild hypothermia alleviates diabetes aggravated cerebral ischemic injury via activating autophagy and inhibiting pyroptosis.
31082455|a|Diabetic patients manifest with more severe neurological deficits than non-diabetes after ischemic stroke. It has been shown that hypothermia has neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia, but whether it is effective for cerebral ischemia in diabetic patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hypothermia can alleviate cerebral ischemic injury in diabetic rats and the regulation of autophagy and pyroptosis of the treatment. We introduced permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in a model of type 2 diabetic rats prepared by high-fat diet combined with intraperitoneal injection of STZ in vivo and mimicked cerebral ischemia with diabetes by employing high glucose stimulation and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro. Moreover, 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1 were used to evaluate the association between autophagy and pyroptosis in vitro. Our results showed that diabetes aggravated neurological deficits, increased the volume of cerebral infarction and brain edema as well as the blood brain barrier permeability after cerebral ischemia, which were alleviated by mild hypothermia. Compared with the pMCAO model in non-diabetic rats and OGD/R model without high glucose stimulation in vitro, the expression of P62, NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1 and Gasdermin-N increased and the ratio of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) Ⅱ/Ⅰ decreased in the pMCAO model in diabetic rats and OGD/R model with high glucose stimulation, which could be reversed by mild hypothermia. In conclusion, mild hypothermia alleviated diabetes aggravated cerebral ischemic injury via activating autophagy and inhibiting pyroptosis.

30519872|t|Effect of Tai Chi on Cardiac and Static Pulmonary Function in Older Community-Dwelling Adults at Risk of Ischemic Stroke: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
30519872|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of tai chi exercise on cardiac and static lung function for older community-dwelling adults at risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS: A total of 170 older community-dwelling adults (aged 55-75 years old) at risk of ischemic stroke were allocated to either tai chi training group (85 cases, five 60-min sessions of tai chi training per week for 12 weeks) or control group (85 cases, usual pbysical activity for 12 weeks) using a computer-generated randomization. The echocardiographic parameters of cardiac structure, cardiac function and static lung function were measured at baseline, after 12 weeks of intervention and additional 12-week follow-up period by a blinded professional staffmember using a color Doppler ultrasound imaging device or a cardiopulmonary function instrument. The t test and linear mixed model based on the intentionto-treat analysis principle was used to calculate the effect. The adverse effect was observed. RESULTS: Most of echocardiographic parameters on the cardiac structure, cardiac function and static lung function between the tai chi group and control group did not have a significant difference either post 12-week intervention or additional 12-week follow-up period. Only three parameters involving in right ventricular diameter (P=0.024), main pulmonary artery diameter (P=0.002) and vital capacity maximum (P=0.036) were beneficial to be improved in the tai chi group compared to the control group by the analysis of mixed linear model. No adverse effects were found during the intervention period. CONCLUSION: The 12-week tai chi exercise did not have an obvious beneficial effect on cardiac structure, cardiac function and static lung function in older community-dwelling adults at risk of ischemic stroke. The study with a longer duration of intervention should be necessary. (Trial registration No. ChiCTR-TRC-13003601).

31331548|t|Use of Chinese herbal medicines by rheumatoid arthritis patients was associated with lower risk of stroke: A retrospective cohort study.
31331548|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have increased risk of developing stroke. The use Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) is increasing, but whether they can reduce the risk of developing stroke remains unclear. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study to compare the effect of CHMs use on the subsequent stroke risk in RA individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using claims data from the National Health Insurance of Taiwan, we identified 7925 newly-diagnosed RA patients with no history of previous stroke who were 20 years of age or older between 1998 and 2010. From this sample, we enrolled 3134 CHMs users and 3134 non-CHMs users, randomly selected using propensity scores matching from the remaining cases. They were followed until the end of 2012 to record stroke incidence. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compute the hazard ratio of stroke with regard to CHMs use. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 299 CHMs users and 395 non-CHMs users developed stroke, representing incidence rates of 10.94 and 16.69, respectively, per 1000 person-years. CHMs use was associated with 38% (adjusted HR: 0.62; 95% confidence interval: 0.54-0.73) lower subsequent risk of stroke. The most prominent effect was observed in those receiving CHMs for over two years. The following seven commonly-prescribed CHMs were found to lessen the stroke risk: Dan-Shen, Tian-Hua-Feng, Fu-Zi, Shao-Yao-Gan-Cao-Tang, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, Ge-Gen-Tang, and Gui-Zhi-Shao-Yao-Zhi-Mu-Tang. CONCLUSION: The CHMs use was associated with lower risk of stroke for RA patients, suggesting that it could be integrated into conventional therapy to prevent subsequent stroke incident.

31107694|t|Traditional Chinese medicine training for cardiac rehabilitation: a randomized comparison with aerobic and resistance training.
31107694|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of different exercise regimens in the rehabilitation of patients with stable coronary heart disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial to screen 141 patients with stable coronary heart disease who were admitted to the General Administration of Sport of China Sports Medical Science Institute from January 2018 to September 2018. They were randomly divided into the aerobic and resistance training (ART) group for 12 weeks (36 cases), the traditional Chinese medicine training (TCMT) group 12 weeks (37 cases), and the control (CON) group (39 cases). We analyzed the baseline parameters of all participants and the 12-week exercise plate test parameters and related physical and body parameters. RESULT: After 12 weeks of intervention, volume of oxygen (VO2), VO2/kg, metabolic equivalents, VO2/heart rate, stroke volume, and peaked grip strength and flexibility parameters of the ART group and the TCMT group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P<0.05). Resting heart rate of the TCMT group was significantly lower than the CON group, but there was no significant difference between the ART and CON groups (P>0.05). Ventilation/VO2 of the TCMT group was significantly higher than that of the CON group. BMI of the ART group was significantly lower than that of the TCMT group and the CON group, and body fat mass of the TCMT group was significantly smaller than that of the ART group, but there was no difference between the TCMT group and the CON group for BMI and body fat mass. CONCLUSION: Both ART and TCMT can improve the cardiopulmonary aerobic exercise capacity and physical fitness of patients with stable coronary heart disease. Although the degree of improvement is different, they all have certain effects on the rehabilitation of patients with stable coronary heart disease and the application is safe.

29556676|t|Blood pressure and collateral circulation in acute ischemic stroke.
29556676|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different blood pressure (BP) parameters on the collateral circulation in a retrospective cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke and ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion. METHODS: The degree of intracranial collaterals was graded according to the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology (ASITN/SIR) Collateral Flow Grading System. At 12-72 h after stroke onset, six BP measurements were obtained in 124 patients with ICA occlusion. Baseline clinical and imaging characteristics were collected. Group comparisons were performed, and the collateral score (CS) was assessed and entered into a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In all, 80 (64.5%) patients displayed good collateral filling (CS ≥ 2). Good intracranial collaterals were more frequently associated with the development of collaterals in the anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, and leptomeningeal artery. The systolic blood pressure (SBP; p = 0.018), diastolic blood pressure (DBP; p = 0.013), and mean arterial pressure (MAP; p = 0.016) were significantly associated with good CS. Median CS was highest when SBP was 120-130 mm Hg (p = 0.034). Logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension (p = 0.026, OR: 0.380, 95% CI: 0.163-0.890) was a significant predictor of poor CS. CONCLUSION: The development of collateral circulation in patients with acute ischemic stroke with ICA occlusion may be influenced by BP. A moderately decreased SBP is associated with good integrity of the collateral circulation in patients with acute ischemic stroke with occlusion of the ICA.

30074228|t|The Serum BDNF Level Offers Minimum Predictive Value for Motor Function Recovery After Stroke.
30074228|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis following ischemic and non-ischemic brain injury. The predictive value of BDNF for short-term outcome after stroke is controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship among serum BDNF level, fractional anisotropy (FA), and functional outcome during post-acute stroke rehabilitation. Serum BDNF levels were measured on admission to an acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital. The primary functional outcome was functional independence measure (FIM) motor subscore at discharge. The secondary outcome measures were FIM total score at discharge, FIM motor subscore on admission, length of stay in the hospital, and discharge destination. We investigated the relationship among the level of serum BDNF and FA as well as functional outcome measures. Three hundred forty-eight consecutive stroke subjects were included in the analysis. Serum BDNF levels on admission were statistically but not clinically correlated with FIM motor subscore at discharge (r = 0.173, P = 0.001) and FIM total score at discharge (r = 0.155, P = 0.004). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of BDNF as a predictor for FIM motor subscore improvement showed low accuracy of prediction with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.581 (P = 0.026). Serum BDNF significantly correlated with FA in the high FIM motor group (n = 10, r = 0.609, P = 0.031) but not in the low FIM motor group (n = 11, r = - 0.132, P = 0.349). The serum BDNF level alone offers minimum predictive value for recovery of motor function during post-acute rehabilitation. Our findings suggest that serum BDNF level may be correlated with FA.

31602864|a|This research is launched to look for the medication rules and characteristics of Tibetan medicine in the treatment of gZav-Grib( apoplexy sequelae). HIS records of gZav-Grib patients were selected from the Tibetan Hospital of Tibet Autonomous Region and Tibetan Hospital of the city of Naqu. SPSS Modeler,Gephi and other data mining and visualization software were used to study the actual law of drug use in the treatment of gZav-Grib in Tibetan medicine. Finally,479 cases of gZav-Grib patients in Tibetan medicine were included. Their average age is 63 and average hospital stay was 32 days. In total,82 Tibetan medicine prescriptions were used for treating gZav-Grib. The frequency in the front is Twenty-flavor Chenxiang Pills( 338 times),Ruyi Zhenbao Pills( 322 times),and Seventy-flavor Zhenzhu Pills( 315 times). According to the regularity of Tebitan medicine,they were applied in different time periods including the early morning,morning,noon,and evening,for example,in the early morning: Seventy-flavor Zhenzhu Pills,morning: Ruyi Zhenbao Pills,noon: Eighteen-flavor Dujuan Pills,evening: Twenty-flavor Chenxiang Pills. In the clinical joint,18 groups were found in the 10% support and 70% confidence. There are two prescriptions confidence more than 80% which nature focus on Gan,Ruan,Xi,Liang,Dun,Han,Wen. gZav-Grib of Tibetan medicine can be divided into two types: r Lung-Grib type and k Hrag-Grib type,in which the medicine of r Lung-Grib type takes Seventy-flavor Zhenzhu Pills as the core prescription,while the medicine of k Hrag-Grib type takes Ruyi Zhenbao Pills as the core prescription. It is found that the treatment of gZav-Grib by Tibetan medicine is mainly dominated by the treatment idea about " Therapeutic r Lung and blood,Consideration of venous diseases". Treatment functions is promoting the circulation of Qi,clearing blood heat and getting rid of bad blood,achieving the purpose of treating both principal secondary aspect of gZav-Grib. The research methods based on the HIS can't only optimize the Tibetan treating gZav-Grib sequela treatment plan and rule of medication,but also provide the scientific basis for Tibetan medicine treat gZav-Grib.

31537219|t|[Improvement of neurological function and stress in patients with acute massive cerebral infarction by mild hypothermia: a prospective randomized controlled study].
31537219|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of mild hypothermiaon neurological function and oxidative stress in patients with acute massive cerebral infarction. METHODS: Sixty patients with acute massive cerebral infarction (within 12 hours of onset, the age < 70 years old) admitted to the First Hospital of Qinhuangdao from August 2017 to August 2018 were enrolled. Patients were divided into control group and observation group according to random number table method, with 30 patients in each group. The control group was given conventional treatment such as lowering intracranial pressure, anticoagulation, improving microcirculation, neurotrophy and anti-stress ulcer, while the observation group was received mild hypothermia (after 72 hours of treatment at 32-35 centigrade, it increased about 1 centigrade every 6 hours until the normal temperature). The neurological impairment (the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS), motor function (Fugl-Meyer score), daily living ability (Bathel index) and coma degree (Glasgow coma scale, GCS) were observed before treatment and 72 hours after treatment. The levels of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and advanced oxidative protein products (AOPP) were measured at same time. After 72 hours of treatment, the therapeutic effect was judged according to the NIHSS score. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in NIHSS score, Fugl-Meyer score, Bathel index and GCS scores, and the levels of plasma MDA, SOD and AOPP between two groups before treatment. Compared with before treatment, NIHSS score and plasma MDA and AOPP levels in the two groups were significantly decreased after treatment, while Fugl-Meyer score, Bathel index, GCS score and plasma SOD activity were significantly increased; and the change of observation group was more significant than those of control group [NIHSS score: 9.78±3.24 vs. 13.44±2.63, MDA (mmol/L): 8.70±2.79 vs. 10.50±3.81, AOPP (μmol/L): 51.10±17.81 vs. 72.60±18.71, Fugl-Meyer score: 55.68±8.38 vs. 46.25±3.92, Bathel index: 66.63±11.25 vs. 56.71±10.81, GCS score: 13.78±1.31 vs. 10.49±1.03, SOD (kU/L): 134.70±29.87 vs. 104.60±25.75, all P < 0.05]. The total effective rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group [93.3% (28/30) vs. 86.7% (26/30), χ2 = 6.119, P = 0.020]. CONCLUSIONS: Mild hypothermia was effective in treating acute massive cerebral infarction. It could significantly improve the neurological function and oxidative stress of patients, improve the quality of life, and was safe and reliable.

31701710|t|[Protective effects of exogenous vitamin D on nerve injury in mice with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion].
31701710|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-VitD3) supplementation on cerebral injury after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in mice with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: Male C57BL6 mice were randomly divided into Sham group, Vehicle group and 1,25-VitD3 group, with 10 mice in each group. Vehicle group and 1,25-VitD3 group were given MCAO for 1 hour, and then killed after reperfusion for 24 hours. Mice in 1,25-VitD3 group were treated with 1,25-VitD3 at the dose of 100 ng/(kg·d) by injected intraperitoneally for 5 days before MCAO operation. Cerebral ischemic penumbra areas of each group were collected for TTC staining, RT-PCR, TTC staining and immunohistochemistry assay. The function defect of mice was evaluated by using neurological function score. RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, the volume of cerebral infarction in Vehicle group was increased significantly, and the expressions of IL-6, IL-1beta and Gp91phox in brain tissues were increased significantly (P＜0.05); compared with Vehicle group, supplementation of 1,25-VitD3 reduced the volume of cerebral infarction by about 50% in I/R mice (P＜0.05), and the expressions of IL-6, IL-1beta and Gp91phox in brain tissues of 1,25-VitD3 group were decreased significantly (P＜0.05). The expression of Foxp3, a T-regulatory cell marker, was significantly increased in the brain of mice (P＜0.05), while the expression of Rorc, a transcription factor, was significantly decreased (P＜0.05), suggesting that Th17/gamma Delta T-cell response was reduced and the number of neutrophils in the brain injury site of mice was significantly reduced (P＜0.05). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D could alleviate the development of cerebral infarction after arterial occlusion (MCAO) reperfusion, and its mechanism may be through regulating the inflammatory response in mouse brain I/R.

31257338|t|Multimode Computed-Tomography-Guided Thrombolysis under a Prolonged Time Window in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.
31257338|a|Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage in patients receiving recombinant-tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) thrombolytic therapy. Research showed that patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) could benefit from multimode computed-tomography- (CT-) guided intravenous thrombolysis over 4.5 hours. The medical data of patients with AIS in our center were retrospectively reviewed, and the data of the multimode CT-guided thrombolytic therapy or nonthrombolytic therapy within different time windows (3-9 hours) were evaluated. 134 AIS cases were selected successfully and divided into three groups: patients with AF treated by rt-PA (AF rt-PA), patients with AF not treated by rt-PA (AF non-rt-PA), and patients without AF treated by rt-PA (non-AF rt-PA). After correcting for the baseline NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), sex, age, and hypertension data, the comparison results showed that the NIHSS improved significantly at hospital discharge for rt-PA-treated patients (n = 47) compared to non-rt-PA-treated patients with AIS (n = 31) with AF (P = 0.0156). The NIHSS evaluation at 90 days of follow-up also improved in rt-PA-treated patients (P = 0.0157). The NIHSS at hospital discharge was higher in AF rt-PA-treated patients compared to non-AF rt-PA-treated patients (P = 0.0167) after correction; the difference was not statistically significant at 90 days of follow-up (P = 0.091). Our research showed that the neural function improved after 3-9 hours of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in patients with AIS and AF. If there is no thrombolytic taboo, the patients could benefit from the thrombolytic therapy, although the onset time window has been extended to 9 hours.

31368288|t|[Possibility of acupuncture treatment of ischemic stroke via regulating intestinal flora-immune response].
31368288|a|At present, intestinal flora has attracted more and more attention from scholars in China and foreign countries, and its association with ischemic stroke (IS) has gradually become a new research hotspot in the field of stroke. Studies also showed that intestinal flora may be a risk factor which directly or indirectly affects the occurrence and development of IS through bacterial metabolites and immune activities. In the present paper, we review the positive effect of acupuncture and moxibustion in alleviating the symptoms of limb locomotor, speech, swallowing dysfunction, cognition, etc. to improve the IS patients' daily life ability and in strengthening the cellular immune function of the body. In addition, acupuncture and moxibustion have a positive effect in regulating intestinal flora and immune inflammation. Hence, in the present paper, we discuss their relationship and the possibility of application of acupuncture and moxibustion therapies to the treatment of IS according to the theory of "intestinal flora-immune response". It is thus reasonable to speculate that acupuncture and moxibustion can be used to promote the recovery of brain tissue injury and neurological function after stroke via correcting intestinal flora disturbance and reducing immune inflammatory response. In-depth exploration of the role of "intestinal flora-immune response" in the treatment of IS and the specific regulatory function of acupuncture and moxibustion will provide new ideas and research approaches to reveal their mechanisms in the treatment of stroke from a new perspective.

31368282|t|[Effect of "Tongdu Tiaoshen" needling combined with swallowing training on dysphagia, cerebral blood flow and serum BDNF and NGF levels in ischemic stroke patients].
31368282|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of Tongdu Tiaoshen (dredging Governor Vessel and regulating mind) needling combined with swallowing training in the treatment of ischemic stroke (IS) with dysphagia, and to investigate its effect on cerebral blood flow and serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). METHODS: A total of 100 IS inpatients with dysphagia were enrolled in the present study, and randomly and equally divided into control group and treatment group by using a random number table. The patients of the control group received routine swallowing training including tongue extending and retracting, cheek-muscle training, breathing exercise, and laryngopharyngeal exercise, beginning from the 2nd day after hospitalization. The patients of the treatment group received manual acupuncture stimulation of Dazhui (GV14), Fengfu (GV16), Shenting (GV24), Shendao (GV11), Baihui (GV20), Shuigou (GV26), etc., on the basic treatment as those mentioned in the control group. The treatment was conducted once daily, 5 times per week and for 4 successive weeks. The swallowing ability was tested by using video fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), Kubota water swallowing test, and the standard swallowing function assessment (SSA) scale, separately, and patients' daily life quality was assessed by using swallowing related quality of life questionnaire (SWAL-QOL). The cerebral hemodynamics including mean blood flow velocity (Vm), maximum peak flow speed (Vs), and vascular resistance index (RI) of the bilateral cerebral arteries was detected by transcranial color Doppler ultrasound tests, and serum BDNF and NGF contents were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The therapeutic effect of swallowing ability was evaluated after the treatment. RESULTS: After 4 weeks' treatment, the scores of Kubata water swallowing test, SSA, and SWAL-QOL and RI were considerably decreased (P<0.01), and the VFSS scores, Vs and Vm levels as well as serum BDNF and NGF contents were significantly increased (P<0.01) in both groups compared with their own pre-treatment. Of the 48 and 49 cases in the control and treatment groups, 4 (8.33%) and 8(16.33%) were cured, 26 (54.17%) and 33 (67.35%) effective, 18 (37.50%) and 8 (16.33%) failed, with the effective rate being 62.50% and 83.67%, respectively. The therapeutic effect of the treatment group was significantly superior to that of the control group in the effective rate (P<0.05), and in lowering the scores of Kubota water swallowing test, SWAL-QOL, SSA, RI, and in up-regulating the scores of VFSS, Vs and Vm, and serum BDNF and NGF levels (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Tongdu Tiaoshen needling combined with swallowing training is effective in improving swallowing ability, promoting cerebral blood flow and in up-regulating serum neurotrophic factor levels in patients with dysphagia after ischemic stroke.

31331288|a|BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of plasma D-dimer increase the risk of ischemic stroke, stroke severity, and the progression of stroke status, but the association between plasma D-dimer level and functional outcome is unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate whether plasma D-dimer level is a determinant of short-term poor functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: This prospective study included 877 Chinese patients with AIS admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University within 72 h of symptom onset. Patients were categorized by plasma D-dimer level: Quartile 1(≤0.24 mg/L), Quartile 2 (0.25-0.56 mg/L), Quartile 3 (0.57-1.78 mg/L), and Quartile 4 (> 1.78 mg/L). The medical record of each patient was reviewed, and demographic, clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging information was abstracted. Functional outcome at 90 days was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS: Poor outcome was present in 302 (34.4%) of the 877 patients that were included in the study (mean age, 64 years; male, 68.5%). After adjustment for potential confounding variables, higher plasma D-dimer level on admission was associated with poor outcome (adjusted odds ratio 2.257, 95% confidence interval 1.349-3.777 for Q4:Q1; P trend = 0.004). According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the best discriminating factor for poor outcome was a plasma D-dimer level ≥ 0.315 mg/L (area under the ROC curve 0.657; sensitivity 83.8%; specificity 41.4%). CONCLUSION: Elevated plasma D-dimer levels on admission are significantly associated with poor outcome after admission for AIS, suggesting the potential role of plasma D-dimer level as a predictive marker for short-term poor outcome in patients with AIS.

31326927|t|Rehabilitation for balance impairment in patients after stroke: a protocol of a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
31326927|a|INTRODUCTION: Multiple rehabilitation therapies have been reported to be effective for poststroke balance impairment. However, the comparative effectiveness of these rehabilitation therapies is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to summarise evidence and identify the most effective rehabilitation therapy for poststroke balance impairment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following databases will be searched: China Biology Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang Data, the Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, Medline, Excerpt Medical Database (EMBASE), Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, from inception to June 2019. All randomised controlled trials that have used rehabilitation interventions to treat poststroke balance impairment will be included. The primary outcomes are the Berg Balance Scale, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (balance), the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke, as well as the function in sitting test, the Sitting Balance Scale, the Ottawa Sitting Scale, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, the Overall Balance Index and the Brunel Balance Assessment. The secondary outcomes include the Barthel Index, the Functional Ambulation Category Scale, fall rates, the Timed Up and Go test, the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and adverse events. To ensure that all relevant studies are included without personal bias, study selection, data extraction and quality assessment will be performed independently by two reviewers. Risk of bias will be assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Review Manager V.5.3 software will be used to make bias risk diagram and pairwise meta-analysis, while network data synthesis will be performed using WinBUGS V.1.4.3 and R software. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for systematic review and network meta-analysis. The results will be submitted to a peer review journal or at a conference.

31391862|t|Safety and Efficacy of the C-117 Formula for Vulnerable Carotid Artery Plaques (Spchim): A Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Pilot Study.
31391862|a|Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the Herbal Medicine C-117 (C-117) formula in the treatment of carotid atherosclerotic vulnerable plaques. Methods: This was a prospective, single-centre, randomized, double-blind study. A total of 120 eligible patients were randomly divided into two groups to receive the C-117 formula or placebo. As the basic treatment, both groups were treated according to the Guidelines for Secondary Prevention of Ischemic Stroke/Transient Ischemic Stroke in China using statins to regulate blood lipids, blood pressure lowering drugs, drugs for controlling blood sugar, and antiplatelet drugs according to the indications. The primary outcomes were the change in stability, the mean change of the plaque Crouse score, and the area and number of bilateral carotid artery plaques before and after 6 months of treatment. The secondary outcomes were the total number of cardiocerebrovascular events during the treatment and follow-up and the mean changes of lipid levels. Result: After 180 days of treatment, the plaque Crouse score(95% CI, 0.39 (0.01-0.77), P=0.046) and plaque area (95% CI, 2.14 (-10.10-14.39), P=0.727) were lower in the C-117 formula group than that before treatment. The plaque Crouse score of the control group (95% CI, 0.17 (-0.24-0.57), P=0.417) was lower than that before treatment, while the plaque area (95% CI, -0.35 (-9.35-8.65), P=0.938) increased, but without statistical significance. There was no significant difference in the reduction of the intima-media thickness (IMT), plaque Crouse score, or plaque area between the two groups after treatment (P>0.05). Subgroup analysis of patients whose Lipitor medication time ≥ 20% of the 6-month treatment showed that the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein were lower in the two groups after treatment than before, and the low-density lipoprotein levels in the C-117 formula group significantly decreased (95% CI, 2.99 (-0.08-0.39), P=0.005), but there was no statistical difference between the two groups after treatment (P>0.05). No serious adverse events occurred in the two groups after 180 days of treatment. Conclusion: The C-117 formula may be antiatherosclerotic by strengthening statins to reduce the low-density lipoprotein levels and reducing the carotid plaque Crouse scores. Clinical trials with large sample sizes, long-term interventions, and follow-up are needed to investigate the efficacy of the C-117 formula. Clinical Trials Registration: This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03072225 (registered retrospectively on 1st March 2017).

31379969|t|Kinesio Taping for Balance Function after Stroke: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
31379969|a|Objective: With the increasing social and economic burdens of balance impairment after stroke, the treatment for balance impairment after stroke becomes a major public health problem worldwide. Kinesio taping (KT) as a part of clinical practice has been used widely in the treatment of balance impairment after stroke. However, the clinical effects of KT for balance function have not been confirmed. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects and safety of KT for balance impairment after stroke. Methods: We conducted a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of KT for balance impairment after stroke. We searched the following databases: (1) English databases: EMBASE (via Ovid), MEDLINE (via Ovid), the Cochrane library, PubMed, and PEDro; (2) Chinese databases: China Biology Medicine (CBM), Wan Fang database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and VIP. Besides, hand searches of relevant references were also conducted. We systematically searched from the inception to December 2018, using the keywords (Kinesio, Kinesio Tape, tape, or Orthotic Tape) and (stroke, hemiplegia, or hemiplegic paralysis) and (balance or stability). The search strategies were adjusted for each database. The reference lists of included articles were reviewed for relevant trials. For missing data, we contacted the authors to get additional information. Results: 22 RCTs involved 1331 patients, among which 667 patients in the experimental group and 664 patients in the control group were included. Results of meta-analysis showed that, compared with conventional rehabilitation (CR), there was significant difference in Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (MD=4.46, 95%CI 1.72 to 7.19, P=0.001), Time Up and Go Test (TUGT) (MD=-4.62, 95%CI -5.48 to -3.79, P < 0.00001), functional ambulation category scale (FAC) (MD=0.53, 95%CI 0.38 to 0.68, P < 0.00001), Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA-L) (MD=4.20, 95%CI 3.17 to 5.24, P < 0.00001), and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) (MD=-0.38, 95%CI -0.49 to -0.27, P < 0.00001). The results of subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant difference between KT and CR with ≤4 weeks treatment duration (< 4 weeks: MD=5.03, 95%CI -1.80 to 11.85, P=0.15; =4 weeks: MD=4.33, 95%CI -1.50 to 10.15, P=0.15), while there was significant difference with more than 4-week treatment duration (MD=4.77, 95%CI 2.58 to 6.97, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Based on current evidence, KT was more effective than CR for balance function, lower limb function, and walking function in poststroke patients. Longer treatment duration may be associated with better effects. However, more well-conducted RCTs are required in the future.

31039389|t|Moringa oleifera seed extract protects against brain damage in both the acute and delayed stages of ischemic stroke.
31039389|a|The extract of Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) seeds exerts various pharmacological effects. Our previous study demonstrated that M. oleifera seed extract (MSE) alleviates scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairment in mice. In the present study, we investigate the neuropharmacological properties of 70% ethanolic MSE in the acute and delayed stages of ischemic stroke. MSE may be effective for the prevention and/or treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The most effective dose was 500 mg/kg, and the therapeutic window seemed to be within 4 h after reperfusion. Additionally, we found that MSE treatment improved animal survival, reversed spatial cognitive impairment and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity as well as the cholinergic neurotransmission system during the recovery stages of ischemic stroke. Our findings verified that MSE has neuroprotective effects in both the acute and chronic stages of ischemic stroke. The relevant mechanism of protection may occur by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity as well as improving cholinergic function. These findings suggest that M. oleifera seed extract may be a promising neuroprotective agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

30253882|t|Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: State of the art.
30253882|a|Stroke prevention is the cornerstone of the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Individual stroke risk stratification is generally the first step of deciding whether oral anticoagulation (OAC) will benefit patients with AF. Given that existing approaches to the prediction of 'high-risk' subjects are of limited value, the initial focus should be the identification of 'low-risk' patients who do not need antithrombotic therapy. For this, the CHA2DS2-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 [2 points], diabetes mellitus, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack [2 points], vascular disease, age 65-74, female sex) performs well in identifying really low-risk patients (score of 0 in males or 1 in females), for whom OAC can be omitted. The approach to AF management has changed, with the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) providing relatively better efficacy, safety and convenience compared with the traditional vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The latter drugs are performing well, if attention is directed towards good quality anticoagulation control, as reflected by a time in therapeutic range (TTR) >70%. Nevertheless, OAC use remains suboptimal especially in some regions, such as Asia and Africa. Long-term adherence and quality of OAC use need to be maintained for better outcomes in patients with AF.

31360720|t|Evaluation and Identification of the Neuroprotective Compounds of Xiaoxuming Decoction by Machine Learning: A Novel Mode to Explore the Combination Rules in Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescription.
31360720|a|Xiaoxuming decoction (XXMD), a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription, has been used as a therapeutic in the treatment of stroke in clinical practice for over 1200 years. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of XXMD have not yet been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to develop neuroprotective models for identifying neuroprotective compounds in XXMD against hypoxia-induced and H2O2-induced brain cell damage. In this study, a phenotype-based classification method was designed by machine learning to identify neuroprotective compounds and to clarify the compatibility of XXMD components. Four different single classifiers (AB, kNN, CT, and RF) and molecular fingerprint descriptors were used to construct stacked naïve Bayesian models. Among them, the RF algorithm had a better performance with an average MCC value of 0.725±0.014 and 0.774±0.042 from 5-fold cross-validation and test set, respectively. The probability values calculated by four models were then integrated into a stacked Bayesian model. In total, two optimal models, s-NB-1-LPFP6 and s-NB-2-LPFP6, were obtained. The two validated optimal models revealed Matthews correlation coefficients (MCC) of 0.968 and 0.993 for 5-fold cross-validation and of 0.874 and 0.959 for the test set, respectively. Furthermore, the two models were used for virtual screening experiments to identify neuroprotective compounds in XXMD. Ten representative compounds with potential therapeutic effects against the two phenotypes were selected for further cell-based assays. Among the selected compounds, two compounds significantly inhibited H2O2-induced and Na2S2O4-induced neurotoxicity simultaneously. Together, our findings suggested that machine learning algorithms such as combination Bayesian models were feasible to predict neuroprotective compounds and to preliminarily demonstrate the pharmacological mechanisms of TCM.

31291976|t|A clinical study to assess the influence of acupuncture at "Wang's Jiaji" acupoints on limb spasticity in patients in convalescent stage of ischemic stroke: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
31291976|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is characterized by high morbidity, high mortality, and high disability. Spasticity, one of the most common complications after stroke, may reduce the potential success of rehabilitation and has a detrimental effect on stroke patients' daily function and quality of life. Moreover, the long-term management of spasticity is a financial burden to patients and increases societal costs. The current treatments, mainly including physical therapy, oral drugs, drug injection therapy, and surgical interventions, have been used to reduce spasticity. However, every conventional approach has its limitations. Acupuncture at the "Wang's Jiaji" acupoints, based on the experience of the famous old doctor of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Le Ting Wang in treating post-stroke limb spasm, has been widely practiced in our department. This intervention has effectively avoided the controversy around acupuncture at local acupoints on the limbs, and is easy to apply without side effects. Our previous studies had found that acupuncture at the "Wang's Jiaji-points" can reduce the occurrence and severity of spasticity occurring after stroke in the early stage (the first 21 days). In this study, we chose patients in the convalescent stage, 1-6 months after stroke, so as to study the efficacy and the specific intervention time of "Wang's jiaji" in the convalescent stage after stroke. METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, and single-blind study. Patients in the convalescent stage within 1-6 months of ischemic stroke will be selected as subjects. A total of 100 subjects will be randomly assigned to two groups. The acupuncture group will be given acupuncture treatment five times a week; the medicine group will be given 10mg baclofen three times a day. These two groups will continue to receive current usual care for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases, but drugs that affect muscle tone will not be allowed. The treatment will last for 2 weeks. The primary outcome measurement is the simplified Fugl-Meyer Assessment. The secondary outcome measurements are the Modified Ashworth Scale, Modified Barthel Scale, and the H-reflex, F response, and H/M ratios of electromyography. All outcome measurements are assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after first treatment except the electromyography, which is assessed at baseline and 2 weeks after first acupuncture. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to evaluate the effects and the specific intervention time of "Wang's Jiaji" acupoints on spasticity after stroke. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN31511176 .

31354412|t|An MRI Study of Neurovascular Restorative After Combination Treatment With Xiaoshuan Enteric-Coated Capsule and Enriched Environment in Rats After Stroke.
31354412|a|Xiaoshuan enteric-coated capsule (XSEC) is a Chinese medicinal compound widely used for treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. Enriched environment (EE) is an effective rehabilitative protocol designed to enhance sensorimotor, cognitive and social stimulation. This study aimed to apply magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to non-invasively assess whether EE could augment the therapeutic benefits of XSEC on post-ischemic neurovascular remodeling. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and treated with XSEC and EE alone or combination for 30 consecutive days. Beam walking test and Morris water maze (MWM) test were performed to evaluate motor and cognitive function, respectively. Multimodal MRI was applied to examine alterations to brain structures, intracranial vessels, and cerebral perfusion on the 31st day after MCAO. Double-immunofluorescent staining was used to evaluate neurogenesis and angiogenesis. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), and the axon guidance molecules. Combination therapy with XSEC and EE significantly reduced cystic volume compared with XSEC and EE monotherapies. In line with this, combination treated rats performed better in the beam walking test and exhibited improved spatial memory in the probe trial of the MWM. Moreover, XSEC and EE combination treatment improved cerebral blood flow (CBF), amplified angiogenesis and upregulated VEGF protein levels. This proangiogenic effect was consistent with the increased progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the peri-infarct cortex and striatum. Specifically, the combined therapy of XSEC and EE markedly increased the Netrin-1 and Robo-1 protein expression levels compared with vehicle group, while no difference was observed between XSEC or EE monotherapy and vehicle group. Together, these findings indicate that the combination of XSEC and EE benefits neurovascular reorganization. This correlates with restoration of CBF, promotion of neurogenesis and angiogenesis, and activation of the intrinsic axonal guidance molecules, thereby facilitating greater physical rehabilitation after ischemic stroke.

31290080|t|Activation of Sigma-1 Receptor Enhanced Pericyte Survival via the Interplay Between Apoptosis and Autophagy: Implications for Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity in Stroke.
31290080|a|Stroke is a cerebrovascular disorder that affects many people worldwide. Pericytes play an important role in stroke progression and recovery. The sigma-1 receptor (σ-1R) signaling pathway has been suggested as having promising neuroprotective potential in treating stroke; however, whether σ-1R activation regulates pericyte function remains unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of σ-1R and a novel σ-1R agonist in pericytes following ischemic stroke. An ischemic stroke animal model was induced by photothrombotic middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in σ-1R knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. After pMCAO, there was significant pericyte loss and coverage in σ-1R KO mice compared with WT mice as determined using transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence staining, and western blot. Interestingly, a novel σ-1R agonist decreased infarct volume and blood-brain barrier damage with a concomitant amelioration of pericyte loss, as determined by western blot. Further studies indicated that cell apoptosis and autophagy were induced in an in vivo pMCAO ischemic stroke animal model and an in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation-treatment group. Inhibition of autophagy using a pharmacological approach significantly mitigated pericyte apoptosis, suggesting that autophagy was upstream of apoptosis in pericytes. Both in vivo and in vitro studies indicated that the σ-1R agonist significantly decreased cell apoptosis via inhibition of autophagy with a subsequent enhancement of pericyte survival. This study identified the unique roles for σ-1R in mediating pericyte survival via the regulation of the interplay between apoptosis and autophagy, suggesting that a novel σ-1R agonist may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of stroke patients.

30995438|t|Geniposide protects against hypoxia/reperfusion-induced blood-brain barrier impairment by increasing tight junction protein expression and decreasing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in an in vitro system.
30995438|a|The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is involved in the pathogeneses of ischemic stroke (IS). Geniposide (GEN), an iridoid glycoside isolated from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, has been used for the treatment of IS. However, the effects of GEN on the BBB are poorly understood. In vitro disease models of the BBB could be very helpful for the elucidation of underlying mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we established an in vitro BBB model composed of primary cultures of brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes. We then used this in vitro model to investigate the effect of GEN on the function of the BBB. Oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) significantly increased permeability and cell apoptosis in this in vitro BBB model. Notably, GEN pretreatment effectively improved the BBB function by decreasing the permeability of the BBB, promoting expression of tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, claudin-5, and occludin) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, increasing transendothelial electrical resistance, mitigating oxidative stress damage and the release of inflammatory cytokines, downregulating the expression levels of matrix metallopeptidases-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2, and increasing the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor. Therefore, GEN can ameliorate the BBB dysfunction induced by OGD/R conditions through multiple protective mechanisms. The findings suggest that GEN may be an appropriate drug for restoring the barrier function of the BBB.

31333457|t|Ginkgo Flavonol Glycosides or Ginkgolides Tend to Differentially Protect Myocardial or Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via Regulation of TWEAK-Fn14 Signaling in Heart and Brain.
31333457|a|Shuxuening injection (SXNI), one of the pharmaceutical preparations of Ginkgo biloba extract, has significant effects on both ischemic stroke and heart diseases from bench to bedside. Its major active ingredients are ginkgo ﬂavonol glycosides (GFGs) and ginkgolides (GGs). We have previously reported that SXNI as a whole protected ischemic brain and heart, but the active ingredients and their contribution to the therapeutic effects remain unclear. Therefore, we combined experimental and network analysis approach to further explore the specific effects and underlying mechanisms of GFGs and GGs of SXNI on ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse brain and heart. In the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) model, pretreatment with GFGs at 2.5 ml/kg was superior to the same dose of GGs in improving cardiac function and coronary blood flow and reducing the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase in serum, with an effect similar to that achieved by SXNI. In contrast, pretreatment with GGs at 2.5 ml/kg reduced cerebral infarction area and cerebral edema similarly to that of SXNI but more significantly compared with GFGs in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) model. Network pharmacology analysis of GFGs and GGs revealed that tumor necrosis factor-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)-fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) signaling pathway as an important common mechanism but with differential targets in MIRI and CIRI. In addition, immunohistochemistry and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were performed to evaluate the regulatory roles of GFGs and GGs on the common TWEAK-Fn14 signaling pathway to protect the heart and brain. Experimental results confirmed that TWEAK ligand and Fn14 receptor were downregulated by GFGs to mitigate MIRI in the heart while upregulated by GGs to improve CIRI in the brain. In conclusion, our study showed that GFGs and GGs of SXNI tend to differentially protect brain and heart from ischemia-reperfusion injuries at least in part by regulating a common TWEAK-Fn14 signaling pathway.

31475205|t|Association of circulating total bilirubin level with ischemic stroke: a systemic review and meta-analysis of observational evidence.
31475205|a|Background: Circulating total bilirubin is a biomarker of ischemic stroke and may serve as a potential prognostic factor. It is imperative to systemically evaluate the correlation between circulating total bilirubin and risk for stroke. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the relationship between total serum bilirubin and risk for stroke. Methods: Studies published before 30 June 2017 were searched in four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central). Additional studies were searched by reviewing references and contacting authors. Cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies in adults that examined the association between serum total bilirubin and stroke were included irrespective of language and date of publication. The primary outcome of this study was ischemic stroke, and the secondary outcome was stroke. Abstract and full-text were reviewed by two independent reviewers, and disagreement was resolved by consulting a third reviewer. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers using a pre-designed data collection form. Results: Eleven observational studies (5 prospective and 6 cross-sectional studies) involving 131,450 subjects were included for analysis. In four studies with 83,380 subjects, the relationship between circulating total bilirubin and ischemic stroke was investigated, ischemic stroke was found in 2,496 patients, and the total odds ratio (OR) of the highest bilirubin and the lowest bilirubin for the occurrence of ischemic stroke was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.58-0.74). Eleven studies with 131,450 subjects explored the correlation between bilirubin and stroke, stroke was reported in 5,060 patients, and the total OR of the highest bilirubin and the lowest bilirubin for the occurrence of stroke was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68-0.79). A stratified analysis based on the gender showed that the total bilirubin level in males correlated with ischemic stroke or stroke, which was not noted in females. Conclusions: The available studies support an inverse association between circulating total bilirubin and risk for ischemic stroke and stroke in males. Prospective studies with large sample size are needed to establish the role of circulating bilirubin in the prevention of stroke.

30931525|t|Inactivation of endothelial adenosine A2A receptors protects mice from cerebral ischaemia-induced brain injury.
30931525|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inactivation of the gene for adenosine A2A receptors (ADORA2A for humans and Adora2a for rodents) protects against brain injury in experimental stroke. However, the cell-specific pathogenic effects of A2A receptors in thromboembolic stroke and the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. Here, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of endothelial A2A receptors after thromboembolic stroke improves post-stroke outcomes via down-regulation of inflammation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Thromboembolic stroke was induced by embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Post-stroke outcomes were determined with neurological deficit scoring, infarct volume, inflammatory marker expression, brain leukocyte infiltration, blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, and oedema assessment. Anti-inflammatory effects of silencing the gene for A2A receptors or pharmacological antagonism of these receptors were assessed in vitro. KEY RESULTS: Thromboembolic stroke induced Adora2a expression in the brain. Mice globally deficient in Adora2a (Adora2a-/- ) were resistant to stroke injury. Mice specifically deficient in endothelial Adora2a (Adora2aΔVEC ) showed reduced leukocyte infiltration, BBB leakage, and oedema after stroke, along with attenuated downstream proinflammatory markers, both in vivo and in vitro. The A2A receptor antagonist, KW 6002, also reduced brain injury and inflammation after stroke. Inactivation of ADORA2A inhibited endothelial inflammation via suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome, down-regulating cleaved caspase 1 and IL-1β expression. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Specific inactivation of endothelial A2A receptors mitigated ischaemic brain injury and improved post-stroke outcomes, at least partly, through anti-inflammatory effects via blockade of NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Our findings may open new approaches to vascular protection after ischaemic stroke.

30982091|t|CKLF1 Aggravates Focal Cerebral Ischemia Injury at Early Stage Partly by Modulating Microglia/Macrophage Toward M1 Polarization Through CCR4.
30982091|a|CKLF1 is a chemokine with increased expression in ischemic brain, and targeting CKLF1 has shown therapeutic effects in cerebral ischemia model. Microglia/macrophage polarization is a mechanism involved in poststroke injury expansion. Considering the quick and obvious response of CKLF1 and expeditious evolution of stroke lesions, we focused on the effects of CKLF1 on microglial/macrophage polarization at early stage of ischemic stroke (IS). The present study is to investigate the CKLF1-mediated expression of microglia/macrophage phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, discussing the involved pathway. Primary microglia culture was used in vitro, and mice transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was adopted to mimic IS. CKLF1 was added to the primary microglia for 24 h, and we found that CKLF1 modulated primary microglia skew toward M1 phenotype. In mice transient IS model, CKLF1 was stereotactically microinjected to the lateral ventricle of ischemic hemisphere. CKLF1 aggravated ischemic injury, accompanied by promoting microglia/macrophage toward M1 phenotypic polarization. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines were observed in mice subjected to cerebral ischemia and administrated with CKLF1. CKLF1-/- mice were used to confirm the effects of CKLF1. CKLF1-/- mice showed lighter cerebral damage and decreased M1 phenotype of microglia/macrophage compared with the WT control subjected to cerebral ischemia. Moreover, NF-κB activation enhancement was detected in CKLF1 treatment group. Our results demonstrated that CKLF1 is an important mediator that skewing microglia/macrophage toward M1 phenotype at early stage of cerebral ischemic injury, which further deteriorates followed inflammatory response, contributing to early expansion of cerebral ischemia injury. Targeting CKLF1 may be a novel way for IS therapy.

31002951|t|Robot-assisted therapy for balance function rehabilitation after stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
31002951|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify the rehabilitative effects of robot-assisted therapy on balance function among stroke patients. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Thirteen electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to March 2018: Web of Science, PubMed, EMBase, The Cochrane Library, Science Direct, CINAHL, MEDLINE, AMED, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, SPORTDiscus, WanFang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Chinese Scientific Journal Database. REVIEW METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were retrieved for identifying the effects of robot-assisted therapy on balance function among stroke patients. Two authors independently searched databases, screened studies, extracted data, and evaluated the methodological quality and risk bias of each included study. A standardized protocol and data-collection form were used to extract information. Effect size was evaluated by mean difference with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Methodological quality and risk bias evaluation for each included study followed the quality appraisal criteria for randomized controlled trials that were recommended by Cochrane Handbook. Meta-analysis was conducted by utilizing Review Manager 5.3, a Cochrane Collaboration tool. Data was synthesized with descriptive analysis instead of meta-analysis where comparisons were not possible to be conducted with a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-one randomized controlled trials with a total of 1249 participants were included. The majority of the included studies contained some methodological flaws. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that robot-assisted therapy produced positive effects on balance function, as shown by an increase in the Berg balance scale score [random effects model, mean difference = 4.64, 95%CI = 3.22-6.06, P＜0.01], as well as Fugl-Meyer balance scale scores [fixed effects model, mean difference = 3.57, 95%CI = 2.81-4.34, P＜0.01]. After subgroup and sensitivity analyses, the positive effects were not influenced by different types of robotic devices, by whether robot-assisted therapy was combined with another intervention or not, or by differences in duration and intensity of intervention. CONCLUSION: Evidence in the present systematic review indicates that robot-assisted therapy may produce significantly positive improvements on balance function among stroke patients compared with those not using this method. More multi-center, high-quality and large-scale randomized controlled trials following the guidelines of CONSORT are necessary to generate high-quality evidence in further research.

30977797|t|Moderate and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest has a comparable effect on acute kidney injury after total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk procedure in type A aortic dissection.
30977797|a|OBJECTIVES: The goal was to investigate the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) after total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk procedure, which was achieved by antegrade cerebral perfusion and moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA) or deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) among patients with type A aortic dissection. METHODS: Overall, 627 adult type A aortic dissection patients who underwent total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk from January 2013 until December 2016 at Fuwai Hospital were divided into the DHCA (14.1-20.0°C) and MHCA (20.1-28.0°C) groups. Postoperative AKI as the primary outcome was compared using propensity-matched scoring. RESULTS: Overall, 340 (54.2%) and 287 (45.8%) patients underwent DHCA and MHCA, respectively. The overall incidence of AKI was 75.4%. Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.04; P = 0.022], body mass index (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.12; P = 0.016), cardiopulmonary bypass duration (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01; P = 0.003) and hypertension history (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.14-2.70; P = 0.010) were identified as independent risk factors for AKI onset with multivariable analysis. Postoperative AKI was not significantly different between the DHCA and MHCA groups regardless of the overall or propensity-matched cohort (overall data: P = 0.17; propensity score data: P = 0.88). Patients with MHCA experienced higher rates of postoperative stroke after propensity score analysis (DHCA 0.9% vs MHCA 3.7%; P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: MHCA was not superior to DHCA in decreasing postoperative AKI. Thus, MHCA should not definitively replace DHCA.

31348252|t|Comparative effectiveness of different forms of traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of post-stroke depression: Protocol for network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
31348252|a|BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy is effective for post-stroke depression (PSD). TCM therapy encompasses various forms of practices. However, the comparative effectiveness of these therapies is still not clear. Here, we provide a network meta-analysis protocol to compare the effects of different types of TCM therapy on PSD, using both direct and indirect evidence. METHODS: Twelve databases investigation will be conducted through the keywords from their inception to June 1, 2019. At least 2 independent reviewers will identify eligible articles. EndNote X7 software is utilized to manage the literatures and RevMan V.5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration) software is for data processing throughout the review. The package "netmeta" (version 0.5-0) in R (version 3.0.2, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing) will be used to perform network meta-analysis (NMA). In addition, the overall quality of evidence is evaluated by GRADEPro software, and Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool is employed for the methodological quality. Generally speaking, this review protocol is reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols 2015 guidelines. RESULTS: According to this protocol, it will provide evidence in support of, or against, the hypothesis that TCM therapy for PSD is more effective than pharmacotherapy. The results of this study will also provide evidence on relative efficacy of different forms of TCM. Furthermore, this analysis will show which form(s) of TCM therapy is (are) the most effective. CONCLUSION: The results will help PSD doctors and patients choose the treatment regimen which is effective, time-saving and economical. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42016041594.

31335738|t|Comparison of the fenestrated and non-fenestrated Fontan procedures: A meta-analysis.
31335738|a|BACKGROUND: The benefits of fenestration for patients undergoing Fontan procedure seem controversial at early and late postoperative stages. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the outcomes between the fenestrated and non-fenestrated Fontan procedures. METHODS: Studies comparing the fenestrated and non-fenestrated Fontan procedures were identified by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases until July 2018. The assessed variables included postoperative oxygen saturation (SaO2), pulmonary artery pressure, mortality, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, ventilation time, intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, chest tube duration, protein-losing enteropathy, arrhythmia, and other follow-up outcomes including reintervention, stroke/thrombosis, and peak oxygen consumption. A random-effect/fixed-effect model was used to summarize the estimates of the mean difference (MD)/odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analysis stratified by early and late outcomes was performed. RESULTS: A total of 1929 Fontan patients from 14 studies were included. The early postoperative SaO2 was lower with fenestration than without fenestration (MD -2.52, 95% CI -4.16 to -0.87, P <.05); however, the late postoperative SaO2 showed no difference between the 2 approaches. The CPB time was shorter without fenestration than with fenestration (MD 10.72, 95% CI 2.54-18.9, P <.05); however, the incidence of arrhythmia was lower with fenestration than without fenestration (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25-0.75, P <.05). Other variables showed no significant differences between the 2 approaches in Fontan patients. CONCLUSION: Fenestration appears to result in a lower incidence of arrhythmia but with a longer CPB time and lower early SaO2. Other outcomes are comparable between the 2 approaches.

31115561|t|MicroRNA‑22 alleviates inflammation in ischemic stroke via p38 MAPK pathways.
31115561|a|The present study aimed to ascertain the potential roles and mechanisms of action of micro (mi)RNA‑22 in ischemic stroke. The results indicated that miRNA‑22 expression was downregulated in ischemic stroke rats model, compared with a control group. The downregulation of miRNA‑22 upregulated the expression of inflammatory factors [including tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6 and IL‑18]. It could also induce the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP‑2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in the in vitro model. By contrast, the overexpression of miRNA‑22 downregulated the expression of inflammatory factors, and suppressed the expression of MIP‑2, PGE2, COX‑2 and iNOS in the in vitro model. The downregulation of miRNA‑22 induced the protein expression of nuclear factor (NF)‑κB and phosphorylated‑p38 (p‑p38) mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the in vitro model. By comparison, the overexpression of miRNA‑22 suppressed the protein expression of NF‑κB and p‑p38 in the in vitro model. Typically, LY2228820, the p38 inhibitor (3 nM) would mitigate the pro‑inflammatory effects of anti‑miRNA‑22 in the in vitro model. These results suggested that miRNA‑22 can alleviate ischemic stroke‑induced inflammation in rats model or vitro model through p38 MAPK/NF‑κB pathway suppression.

31602834|a|Diemailing~® Kudiezi Injection( DKI) is widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction,coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. Long-term clinical application and related research evidence showed that DKI has a good effect in improving the clinical symptoms of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However,this injection has not been included in any clinical practice guideline. It has been found that the use of DKI is in wrong way in clinical practice in recent years. Therefore,clinical experts from the field of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases nationwide are invited to compile this expert consensus in order to guide clinicians.GRADE system is used to grade the quality of evidence according to different outcomes according to degrading factors. Then it forms the recommendation or consensus suggestion through the nominal group method. The formation of expert consensus mainly considers six factors: quality of evidence,economy,efficacy,adverse reactions,patient acceptability and others. Based on these six aspects,if the evidence is sufficient,a " recommendation" supported by evidence is formed,and GRADE grid voting rule is adopted. If the evidence is insufficient,a " consensus suggestions" will be formed,using the majority voting rule. In this consensus,the clinical indications,efficacy,safety evidences and related preliminary data of DKI were systematically and comprehensively summarized in a concise and clear format,which could provide valuable reference for the clinical use of DKI. This consensus has been approved by China association of Chinese medicine which is numbered GS/CACM 202-2019.

31359683|t|[Study on mechanism for treating ischemic stroke of Siegesbeckiae Herba based on network pharmacology].
31359683|a|Xixiancao( Siegesbeckiae Herba) has the effect of treating ischemic stroke( IS),however,the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study,combined with Lipinski's five principles and Veber oral bioavailability rules,68 chemical components of Xixiancao were obtained by database and literature search. Based on the reverse targeting,248 potential targets were obtained and mapped it to the ischemic stroke target set,47 potential targets for the treatment of ischemic stroke were obtained. Molecular docking technique was used to verify that the Xixiancao component has good binding activity to potential targets. GO enrichment analysis and pathway analysis were performed on potential targets using Clue GO. GO enrichment analysis showed that Xixiancao was mainly involved in life processes such as neuronal apoptosis,cholesterol storage and blood pressure regulation. Pathway analysis showed that Xixiancao may promote vascular repairing and regeneration by regulating the expression of ADAMTS1,FLT1 and KDR in VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathway,activate cell survival signals and inhibit neuronal apoptosis by regulating the expression of CAMK2 AA,MDM2,MAPK1,MAPK3,CDK5 and MAPK10 in brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway and PI3 K-Akt signaling pathway. Lipid homeostasis and inflammation may also be regulated by Xixiancao through regulating the expression of ESR1,NR1 H3,PPARA,PPARG in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway. In addition,Xixiancao could also prevent platelet aggregation by regulating the expression of ITGA2 B,F2,F10,and ALB,and play an antithrombotic role. The results of this study indicate that Xixiancao plays an important role in the treatment of ischemic stroke mainly through anti-thrombosis,promoting angiogenesis,protecting neurons,anti-inflammatory and regulating blood pressure and lipids.

31297056|t|Dual Effects of Chinese Herbal Medicines on Angiogenesis in Cancer and Ischemic Stroke Treatments: Role of HIF-1 Network.
31297056|a|Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)-induced angiogenesis has been involved in numerous pathological conditions, and it may be harmful or beneficial depending on the types of diseases. Exploration on angiogenesis has sparked hopes in providing novel therapeutic approaches on multiple diseases with high mortality rates, such as cancer and ischemic stroke. The HIF-1 pathway is considered to be a major regulator of angiogenesis. HIF-1 seems to be involved in the vascular formation process by synergistic correlations with other proangiogenic factors in cancer and cerebrovascular disease. The regulation of HIF-1-dependent angiogenesis is related to the modulation of HIF-1 bioactivity by regulating HIF-1α transcription or protein translation, HIF-1α DNA binding, HIF-1α and HIF-1α dimerization, and HIF-1 degradation. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines have a long history of clinical use in both cancer and stroke treatments in Asia. Growing evidence has demonstrated potential proangiogenic benefits of Chinese herbal medicines in ischemic stroke, whereas tumor angiogenesis could be inhibited by the active components in Chinese herbal medicines. The objective of this review is to provide comprehensive insight on the effects of Chinese herbal medicines on angiogenesis by regulating HIF-1 pathways in both cancer and ischemic stroke.

31060778|t|Long non-coding RNA CHRF modulates the progression of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via miR-126/SOX6 signaling pathway.
31060778|a|Ischemic stroke remains as a major cause for disability and death in the world. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) cardiac hypertrophy-related factor (CHRF) has been suggested as a crucial modulator in cardiac injury and various human cancers. Nevertheless, its effects and mechanism on ischemic stroke remains unclear. In this study, we found that CHRF was significantly correlated with miR-126, and miR-126 expression was decreased in the ischemic core following ischemia, while CHRF expression was increased according to the in vivo and in vitro experiments. Additionally, miR-126 significantly reduced oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R)-triggered apoptosis using TUNEL and flow cytometry analysis. Moreover, CHRF played as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and competed with Sex-determining region Y box 6 (SOX6) to direct binding with miR-126, subsequently regulating ischemic neuronal death. CHRF knockdown in vivo markedly prevented ischemic damage and alleviated neurological dysfunctions. Thereby, these results revealed a new molecular mechanism of lncRNA CHRF through targeting miR-126/SOX6 signaling to modulate ischemic neuronal injury, providing solid evidence to develop promising therapeutic strategies against cerebral ischemic stroke.

31368273|t|[Progress of researches on acupuncture treatment of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by regulating autophagy in the ischemic cerebral tissue].
31368273|a|Excessive autophagy is one of the crucial factors of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI), which has been demonstrated to be one of the targets for acupuncture treatment of ischemic stroke. In the present paper, we make a review about the development of acupuncture intervention induced improvement of CIRI (such as reducing the infarction area, improving learning-memory ability and motor function) by regulating autophagy in animal studies. Outcomes showed that acupuncture intervention can function in 1) inhibiting CIRI-induced increase of the number of lysosomes and autophagic lysosomes, and relieving structural injury of mitochondria, and reducing the number of autophagosome in the central region of the ischemic cerebral cortex tissue; 2) down-regulating the expression of microtubule-associated protein Ⅱ light chain 3 (LC3Ⅱ) and the ratio of LC3-Ⅱ/LC3-Ⅰ in the ischemic cerebral region, and 3) regulating the expression of Beclin 1 (autophagy-related gene), promoting the expression of P62 (autophagy-related adaptor protein). In addition, acupuncture can also regulate phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)- protein kinase B (AKT)- mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1(mTOR) signaling at different time-points (down-regulation at the early stage and up-regulation at the later stage), and activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mTOR- UNC51-like kinase-1 signaling to relieve cerebral ischemic injury. These results reveal some mechanisms of acupuncture therapy underlying improvement of CIRI and provide experimental basis for clinical application of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

31368261|t|[Acupuncture up-regulates MCT2 expression of peri-ischemic cortex in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats].
31368261|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of manual acupuncture (MA)＋ electroacupuncture (EA) on changes of neurological function and expression of monocarboxylate transporter 2(MCT2)in cerebral ischemia (CI) rats, so as to explore its mechanism underlying improvement of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: Eighty male Wistar rats were equally randomized into four groups: normal control (normal), sham operation (sham), model and acupuncture. The CI model was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with a thread embolus. Manual acupuncture stimulation (mild twisting reinforcing-reducing method) was applied to "Baihui"(GV20)and "Fengfu"(GV16) for 10 min. EA (1 mA, 2 Hz /15 Hz) was respectively applied to bilateral "Quchi" (LI11) and "Zusanli"(ST36) for 20 min, once per day for 7 days. The neurological deficit severity was evaluated according to Zea Longa's methods. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fructose-6-phosphate kinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) in the peri-ischemic cortex tissue was detected by enzymatic chemistry, and the expression of MCT2 detected by immunofluorescence histochemistry, Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR, separately. RESULTS: After CI and in comparison with the normal and sham groups, the Zea Longa's score, the fluorescence intensity and the expression level of MCT2 protein were significantly increased (P<0.01), and the activity of LDH, PFK and PK in the peri-ischemic cortex was significantly decreased in the model group (P<0.01). There was no significant change in the relative expression of MCT2 mRNA (P>0.05). Following the intervention and in comparison with the model group, the Zea Longa's score was considerably decreased in the acupuncture group (P<0.01), the activity of LDH, PFK and PK，and the expression levels of MCT2 protein and mRNA were considerably or further up-regulated in the acupuncture group (P<0.01, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture intervention can improve neurological function in CI rats, which is possibly related with its effects in up-regulating the expression of MCT2 and promoting the utilization of lactate in peri-ischemic cortex.

31209408|t|[Discovery of a new division system in brain and the regionalized drainage route of brain interstitial fluid].
31209408|a|Brain extracellular space (ECS) is a narrow, irregular space, which provides immediate living environment for neural cells and accounts for approximately 15%-20% of the total volume of living brain. Twenty-five years ago, as an interventional radiologist, the author was engaged in investigating early diagnosis and treatment of cerebral ischemic stroke, and the parameters of brain ECS was firstly derived and demonstrated during the study of the permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its diffusion changes in the cerebral ischemic tissue. Since then, the author and his team had been working on developing a novel measuring method of ECS: tracer-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which could measure brain ECS parameters in the whole brain scale and make the dynamic drainage process of the labelled brain interstitial fluid (ISF) visualized. By using the new method, the team made a series of new findings about the brain ECS and ISF, including the discovery of a new division system in the brain, named regionalized ISF drainage system. We found that the ISF drainage in the deep brain was regionalized and the structural and functional parameters in different interstitial system (ISS) divisions were disparate. The ISF in the caudate nucleus could be drained to ipsilateral cortex and finally into the subarachnoid space, which maintained the pathway of ISF-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exchange. However, the ISF in the thalamus was eliminated locally in its anatomical division. After verifying the nature of the barrier structure between different drainage divisions, the author proposed the hypothesis of "regionalized brain homeostasis". Thus, we demonstrated that the brain was protected not only by the BBB, which avoided potential exogenous damage through the vascular system, but was also protected by an internal ISF drainage barrier to avoid potentially harmful interference from other ECS divisions in the deep brain. With the new findings and the proposed hypothesis, an innovative therapeutic method for the treatment of encephalopathy with local drug delivery via the brain ECS pathway was established. By using this new administration method, the drug was achieved directly to the space around neurons or target regions, overwhelming the impendence from the blood-brain barrier, thus solved the obstacles of low efficiency in traditional drug investigation. At present, new methods and discoveries developed by the author and his team have been widely applied in several frontier fields including neuroscience, new drug research and development, neurodevelopment aerospace medicine, clinical encephalopathy treatment,new neural network modeling and so on.

31316680|t|Effects of Apelin on Left Ventricular-Arterial Coupling and Mechanical Efficiency in Rats with Ischemic Heart Failure.
31316680|a|Apelin plays important roles in cardiovascular homeostasis. However, its effects on the mechanoenergetics of heart failure (HF) are unavailable. We attempted to investigate the effects of apelin on the left ventricular-arterial coupling (VAC) and mechanical efficiency in rats with HF. HF was induced in rats by the ligation of the left coronary artery. The ischemic HF rats were treated with apelin or saline for 12 weeks. The sham-operated animals served as the control. The left ventricular (LV) afterload and the systolic and diastolic functions, as well as the mechanoenergetic indices were estimated from the pressure-volume loops. Myocardial fibrosis by Masson's trichrome staining, myocardial apoptosis by TUNEL, and collagen content in the aorta as well as media area in the aorta and the mesenteric arteries were determined. Our data indicated that HF rats manifested an increased arterial load (Ea), a declined systolic function (reduced ejection fraction, +dP/dtmax, end-systolic elastance, and stroke work), an abnormal diastolic function (elevated end-diastolic pressure, τ, and declined -dP/dtmax), and decreased mechanical efficiency. Apelin treatment improved those indices. Concomitantly, increased fibrosis in the LV myocardium and the aorta and enhanced apoptosis in the LV were partially restored by apelin treatment. A declined wall-to-lumen ratio in the mesenteric arteries of the untreated HF rats was further reduced in the apelin-treated group. We concluded that the rats with ischemic HF were characterized by deteriorated LV mechanoenergetics. Apelin improved mechanical efficiency, at least in part, due to the inhibiting cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis in the LV myocardium, reducing collagen deposition in the aorta and dilating the resistant artery.

31035218|t|Risk of cardiometabolic diseases among siblings of patients with bipolar disorder.
31035218|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic diseases are suggested to be associated with bipolar disorder. However, the risk of metabolic disorders in unaffected siblings of patients with bipolar disorder remains unclear. METHODS: From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 7,225 unaffected siblings of bipolar probands and 28,900 age-/sex-/income-/residence-matched control individuals were included and followed until the end of 2011. Individuals who developed metabolic disorders during the follow-up period were identified. RESULTS: The unaffected siblings of bipolar probands had a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia (5.4% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.001), younger age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (34.81 vs. 37.22, p = 0.024), and higher prevalence of any stroke (1.5% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.007) than the controls. Moreover, only male siblings of bipolar probands had an increased risk of dyslipidemia (odds ratio [OR]: 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.48) and higher rates of any stroke (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.02-1.85) and ischemic stroke (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.60-3.70) during the follow-up compared with the controls. DISCUSSION: Unaffected siblings of bipolar patients, particularly brothers, had a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia and ischemic stroke compared with the controls. The result suggests the familial association between cardiometabolic diseases and bipolar disorder. Further research may be necessary to identify this shared etiology between the disorders.

31249590|t|The Integrative Regulatory Network of circRNA, microRNA, and mRNA in Atrial Fibrillation.
31249590|a|Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common irregular heart rhythm which influence approximately 1-2% of the general population. As a potential factor for ischemic stroke, AF could also cause heart failure. The mechanisms behind AF pathogenesis is complex and remains elusive. As a new category of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been known as the key of developmental processes, regulation of cell function, pathogenesis of heart diseases and pathological responses which could provide novel sight into the pathogenesis of AF. circRNAs function as modulators of microRNAs in cardiac disease. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of circRNA in AF, especially the complex interactions among circRNA, microRNA and mRNA, we collected the heart tissues from three AF patients and three healthy controls and profiled their circRNA expressions with circRNA Microarray. The differentially expressed circRNAs were identified and the biological functions of their interaction microRNAs and mRNAs were analyzed. Our results provided novel insights of the circRNA roles in AF and proposed highly possible interaction mechanisms among circRNAs, microRNAs, and mRNAs.

30910581|t|Angong Niuhuang Pill as adjuvant therapy for treating acute cerebral infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
30910581|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Angong Niuhuang Pill (ANP) is a well-known traditional Chinese patent medicine. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ANP as an adjuvant therapy in patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI) and acute intracerebral hemorrhage (AIH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a literature search in Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP database from their inceptions to April 2018. Randomized controlled trials evaluating ANP as an adjuvant therapy for acute stroke were selected. Risk ratio (RR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated between with and without ANP therapy. RESULTS: Eighteen trials involving 1,601 patients were identified and analyzed. Meta-analysis showed that ANP plus usual treatment significantly improved the total response rate in patients with ACI (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.14-1.41) and AIH (RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.14-1.38) compared with the usual treatment alone. Adjuvant treatment with ANP also significantly reduced the neurologic deficit score in patients with ACI (WMD -3.64; 95% CI -4.97 to - 2.31) and AIH (WMD -3.52; 95% CI -5.51 to -1.54). Moreover, ANP significantly improved the Glasgow Coma Scale in patients with ACI (WMD 1.18; 95% CI 0.79-1.56) and AIH (WMD 2.28; 95% CI 1.37-3.19). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant treatment with ANP appears to improve the total response rate and neurologic deficit score in patients with ACI and AIH. More well-designed trials are required due to the suboptimal methodological quality of the included trials.

31231259|t|Combination of Alprazolam and Bailemian Capsule Improves the Sleep Quality in Patients With Post-Stroke Insomnia: A Retrospective Study.
31231259|a|Insomnia is often ignored in the diagnosis and treatment of patients of stroke. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of alprazolam (ALP) combined with Bailemian capsule (BC, a traditional Chinese patent medicine) in the treatment of post-stroke insomnia (PSI). A total of 231 stroke patients involved in this retrospective study were treated with ALP, BC, or ALP + BC for 3 weeks. The quality of sleep was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and polysomnography (PSG), while self-care ability was monitored by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) before and after treatment. Compared with the baseline, the self-care ability of patients in each group was significantly improved after treatment (P < 0.01). The PSQI data showed a significant improvement in all patients in all of the subjective PSQI items and global score (P < 0.05). Notably, ALP + BC administration had a significantly greater effect on sleep latency, quality, disturbance, and efficiency, as well as daytime dysfunction and global PSQI than the use of ALP or BC alone (P < 0.05). The PSG data showed that ALP significantly improved the sleep efficiency and decreased the arousal times, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and sleep latency (P < 0.05), while BC significantly improved the sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and the duration of N3 (P < 0.05). Strikingly, ALP + BC achieved the effect of both ALP and BC (P < 0.05). Importantly, the effect of the combination of ALP and BC was greater than the use of ALP or BC alone, which was consistent with the result of PSQI. In conclusion, the sleep quality and self-care ability of patients with PSI were improved by ALP and BC, thereby supporting the potential advantages of ALP combined with BC in the treatment of patients with PSI.

31169419|t|Understandings of stroke in rural Malaysia: ethnographic insights.
31169419|a|Background: Stroke is a public health concern in Malaysia but local beliefs and lay understandings of stroke have not been examined before. Explanatory models provide a way for people to make sense of their illness and influence health seeking behaviors, in a locally relevant way. Methods: Drawing on ethnographic research from rural Malaysia, this descriptive article explores ethnic Malaysian-Chinese stroke survivors' lay understandings of stroke. Eighteen community-dwelling stroke survivors aged 50-83 took part in the study. Results: Causation of stroke was derived from cultural, biomedical and social sources. Participants also drew simultaneously from both biomedical and traditional explanations of stroke to develop their own understanding of etiology. Similarities with biomedical causation and other studies from different cultures were found. Participants' typically focused on the more immediate effects of stroke and often do not attribute causation and association with their comorbid conditions which are also risk factors of stroke. Conclusion: Lack of knowledge about stroke and its symptoms was evident in participants' account. Findings emphasize the importance of knowledge based health interventions, especially in health education strategies for stroke survivors to reduce delays to diagnosis and potentially improve health outcomes post-stroke. Implications for rehabilitation Stroke survivors often form explanatory models of stroke that draw from both biomedical and traditional explanations of stroke. Understanding how people derive lay understandings of stroke can contribute towards developing the goals and activities that facilitate recovery and rehabilitation in similar settings. Health practitioners in the community should strengthen communication regarding the identification, etiology and risk factors of stroke with stroke survivors and their carers to improve compliance to medication, exercise and diet for better recovery. Sustained health education which is culturally relevant is recommended. Communication should also include non-physical impact of stroke (such as cognitive deficits and emotional difficulties) as the stroke survivors were unlikely to relate such symptoms to stroke.

31032620|t|Acupuncture treatment and the risk of urinary tract infection in stroke patients: a nationwide matched cohort study.
31032620|a|BACKGROUND: The association between acupuncture treatment and post-stroke urinary tract infection (UTI) remains incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term risks of UTI among stroke patients treated with or without acupuncture treatment. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was based on data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan that included hospitalized stroke patients. We identified 19,286 patients aged 30 years and older who were hospitalized for newly diagnosed stroke between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2004. Considering immortal time bias, we compared the incidence of UTI during the follow-up period until the end of 2009 in patients with stroke who did and did not receive acupuncture. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of UTI associated with acupuncture were calculated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. RESULTS: Stroke patients who received acupuncture treatment experienced a lower incidence of UTI than those who were not treated with acupuncture (95.4 vs 110.0 per 1000 person-years) with an HR of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.73-0.80). The association between acupuncture treatment and UTI was significant for both sexes and for patients older than 40 years of age, particularly for patients who had no history of medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide retrospective cohort study, we raised the possibility that acupuncture treatment may be associated with a reduced risk of UTI among stroke patients. However, the protective effect associated with acupuncture treatment requires further validation using randomized clinical trials.

30548093|a|Tongxinluo capsule (TXL), a Chinese prescription, has been extensively used for treating ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases in China. Studies have demonstrated that TXL protects the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after cerebral ischaemia. However, the underlying protective mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Enlightened by the critical role of sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway in promoting BBB integrity through up-regulating tight junction (TJ) proteins, we examined whether the Shh pathway could mediate TXL-induced up-regulation of TJ proteins and subsequent protection against BBB disruption after stroke. Ischaemic stroke was induced in adult male C57BL/6J mice by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). The mice were orally administered TXL (3.0 g/kg) at 1, 3 and 21 hours after stroke. Meanwhile, cyclopamine, a specific Shh pathway inhibitor, was intraperitoneally injected at 1 and 21 hours after stroke. The following parameters were measured at 6 and 24 hours after pMCAO: BBB permeability; TJ proteins including occludin, claudin-5 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1); and Shh signalling molecules such as Shh, Patched, Smoothened (Smo) and Gli-1. Our results showed that TXL protected against BBB disruption at 6 and 24 hours after pMCAO, and cyclopamine partly reversed the protective effect of TXL on BBB. Meanwhile, cyclopamine blocked the effect of TXL-up-regulated expression of occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1. Moreover, TXL up-regulated the expression of Shh derived from astrocytes, Patched, Smo and Gli-1, and thus activated the Shh pathway. And cyclopamine inhibited TXL-induced activation of the Shh pathway. Thus, our study demonstrates that the Shh pathway mediates TXL-induced protection against BBB disruption after ischaemic stroke.

30284459|t|Effects of Xiaoshuan Enteric-Coated Capsule on White and Gray Matter Injury Evaluated by Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Ischemic Stroke.
30284459|a|Xiaoshuan enteric-coated capsule (XSECC) is a drug approved by the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of stroke. This study was to investigate the effects of XSECC on white and gray matter injury in a rat model of ischemic stroke by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and histopathological analyses. The ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The cerebral blood flow measured by arterial spin labeling was improved by treatment with XSECC on the 3rd, 7th, 14th and 30th days after MCAO. Spatiotemporal white and gray matter changes in MCAO rats were examined with DTI-derived parameters (fractional anisotropy, FA; apparent diffusion coefficient, ADC; axial diffusivity, λ//; radial diffusivity, λ⊥). The increased FA was found in the XSECC treatment group in the corpus callosum, external capsule and internal capsule, linked with the decreased λ//, λ⊥ and ADC on the 3rd day and reduced ADC on the 30th day in the external capsule, suggesting XSECC reduced the axon and myelin damage in white matter after stroke. The relative FA in the striatum, cortex and thalamus in XSECC treatment group was significantly increased on the 3rd, 7th, 14th and 30th days accompanied by the increased λ// on the 3rd day and reduced relative ADC and λ⊥ on the 30th day, indicating that XSECC attenuated cell swelling and membrane damage in the early stage and tissue liquefaction necrosis in the late stage in gray matter after stroke. Additionally, XSECC-treated rats exhibited increased mean fiber length assessed by diffusion tensor tractography. Moreover, histopathological analyses provided evidence that XSECC relieved nerve cell and myelin damage in white and gray matter after stroke. Our research reveals that XSECC could alleviate white and gray matter injury, especially reducing nerve cell damage and promoting the repair of axon and myelin after ischemic stroke.

30989368|t|Prevalence and risk factors of stroke in the elderly in Northern China: data from the National Stroke Screening Survey.
30989368|a|BACKGROUND: The overall global burden of stroke is considerable and increasing. In China, stroke is the leading cause of death and disability. METHODS: For this study, we used data from the National Stroke Screening Survey in 2012 and the 2010 Chinese population from sixth National Census of Populations to calculate a standardized (by age, gender, and education) stroke prevalence. Prevalence, risk factors, and management of stroke were compared by gender, age, and site. FINDINGS: The standardized prevalence rate of survival stroke patients in study population aged 60 and older was 4.94% in total. Hypertension was the most prevalent risk factor for stroke. Compared to men, women were more likely to have diabetes, obesity, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and atrial fibrillation (P < 0.05). Men were far more likely to drink and smoke than women (P < 0.05). The rates of diabetes and atrial fibrillation were substantially higher in urban than those in rural stroke survivors (P < 0.05). Rural stroke survivors exhibited higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption than urban stroke survivors (P < 0.05). INTERPRETATION: The stroke prevalence in China is in line with median worldwide stroke prevalence. Traditional risk factors remain highly prevalent in stroke survivors, among which hypertension was the most common. Stroke prevalence rates and risk factors varied by age, sex, and sociogeological factors.

31261559|t|Net clinical benefit analysis of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.
31261559|a|BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in AF and CKD patients remains unknown. This systematic review and meta-analysis will mainly assess net clinical benefit (NCB) property of NOACs versus warfarin in patients with AF and CKD by a pooled-analysis. METHODS: We will search Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Clinical Trials.gov Website comprehensively for eligible randomized controlled trials that report the efficacy and safety outcomes according to renal function of NOACs. Relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using fixed- and random-effects models. Subgroup, sensitivity, and regression analyses will be performed to evaluate intertrial heterogeneity and bias of the results. NCB that balance stroke/systemic embolism (SSE) and major bleeding will be calculated using Singer's method. RESULTS: This systemic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the NCB of NOACs versus warfarin via SSE, major bleeding and all-cause death in patients with CKD. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide new evidence for clinical profile of NOACs on SSE, major bleeding, all-cause death, and NCB in CKD patients. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019116940.

31169676|t|Predictive role of subcomponents of the left arcuate fasciculus in prognosis of aphasia after stroke: A retrospective observational study.
31169676|a|The relationship between the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) and stroke-related aphasia is unclear. In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate the role of subcomponents of the left AF in predicting prognosis of aphasia after stroke. Twenty stroke patients with aphasia were recruited and received language assessment as well as diffusion tensor tractography scanning at admission. According to injury of the left AF, the participants were classified into four groups: group A (4 cases), the AF preserved intactly; group B (6 cases), the anterior segment injured; group C (4 cases), the posterior segment injured; and group D (6 cases), completely injured. After a consecutive speech therapy, language assessment was performed again. Changes of language functions among the groups were compared and the relation between these changes with segments injury of the AF was analyzed. After therapy, relatively high increase score percentage changes in terms of all the subcategories of language assessment were observed both in group A and C; by contrast, only naming in group B, and spontaneous speech in group D. Although no statistical difference was demonstrated among the four groups. In addition, there was no significant correlation between improvement of language function with segments injury of the AF. The predictive role of subcomponents of the left AF in prognosis of aphasia is obscure in our study. Nevertheless, it indicates the importance of integrity of the left AF for recovery of aphasia, namely that preservation of the left AF on diffusion tensor tractography could mean recovery potential of aphasia after stroke.

30762012|t|Aphasia rehabilitation based on mirror neuron theory: a randomized-block-design study of neuropsychology and functional magnetic resonance imaging.
30762012|a|When watching someone performs an action, mirror neurons are activated in a way that is very similar to the activation that occurs when actually performing that action. Previous single-sample case studies indicate that hand-action observation training may lead to activation and remodeling of mirror neuron systems, which include important language centers, and may improve language function in aphasia patients. In this randomized-block-design experiment, we recruited 24 aphasia patients from, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, China. The patients were divided into three groups where they underwent hand-action observation and repetition, dynamic-object observation and repetition, or conventional speech therapy. Training took place 5 days per week, 35 minutes per day, for 2 weeks. We assessed language function via picture naming tests for objects and actions and the Western Aphasia Battery. Among the participants, one patient, his wife and four healthy student volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging to analyze changes in brain activation during hand-action observation and dynamic-object observation. Results demonstrated that, compared with dynamic-object observation, hand-action observation led to greater performance with respect to the aphasia quotient and affiliated naming sub-tests and a greater Western Aphasia Battery test score. The overall effect was similar to that of conventional aphasia training, yet hand-action observation had advantages compared with conventional training in terms of vocabulary extraction and spontaneous speech. Thus, hand-action observation appears to more strongly activate the mirror neuron system compared with dynamic-object observation. The activated areas included Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and the supramarginal gyrus. These results suggest that hand-action observation combined with repetition might better improve language function in aphasia patients compared with dynamic-object observation combined with repetition. The therapeutic mechanism of this intervention may be associated with activation of additional mirror neuron systems, and may have implications for the possible repair and remodeling of damaged nerve networks. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Nanjing Medical University, China (approval number: 2011-SRFA-086) on March 11, 2011. This trial has been registered in the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN84827527).

30904670|t|Poloxamer 188 rescues MPTP-induced lysosomal membrane integrity impairment in cellular and mouse models of Parkinson's disease.
30904670|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Rupture of lysosome is a major cellular stress condition leading to cell death in PD. We have previously shown that environmental oxidative toxins could impair autophagic flux and lysosomal functions in PD. Poloxamer 188 (P188) is an amphipathic polymer which has cytoprotective effect in traumatic brain injury and stroke. But whether Dyrk1A could rescue lysosome malfunction-mediated DA neuron death and α-synuclein aggregation in PD is still unknown. In the present study, MPTP mice models and MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells were used for study, and we found that P188 rescued MPP+-induced lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagy flux in mild MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells. P188 administration significantly restored lysosomal membrane integrity and prevented cathepsins leakage from the lysosomes into the cytoplasm, which triggered caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in sub-acute MPTP mouse model and MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, P188 ameliorated α-synuclein accumulation and behavioral impairment in chronic MPTP mouse model with MPTP and probenecid treatment. P188 could alleviate MPTP-induced DA neurons damage by restoring lysosome function.

30810516|t|Exposure to female estrous is beneficial for male mice against transient ischemic stroke.
30810516|a|OBJECTIVE: Exposure to female estrous, a natural rewarding experience, alleviates anxiety and depression, and the contribution of this behavior to stroke outcome is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether exposure to female estrous is beneficial to recovery following transient ischemic stroke in male mice. METHODS: Cerebral ischemia was induced in male ICR mice with thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 30 min followed by reperfusion. MCAO mice were randomly divided into MCAO group and Estrous Female Exposure (EFE) group. The mice in the EFE group were subjected to estrous female mouse interaction from day 1 until the end of the experiment. Mortality was recorded during the investigation. Behavioral functions were assessed by a beam-walking test and corner test from day 1 to day 10 after MCAO. Serum testosterone levels were analyzed with ELISA, and the expression levels of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and synaptophysin in the cortex of the ischemic hemisphere were determined by western blot on day 7 after MCAO. RESULTS: Exposure to female estrous reduced the mortality induced by cerebral ischemic lesions. The beam-walking test demonstrated that exposure to female estrous significantly improved motor function recovery. The serum testosterone levels and ischemic cortex GAP-43 expression were significantly higher in MCAO male mice exposed to female estrous. CONCLUSION: Exposure to female estrous reduces mortality and improves functional recovery in MCAO male mice. The study provides the first evidence to support the importance of female interaction to male stroke rehabilitation.

31048033|t|Ginsenoside F1 promotes angiogenesis by activating the IGF-1/IGF1R pathway.
31048033|a|Ischemic stroke is one of the most lethal and highly disabling diseases that seriously affects the human health and quality of life. A therapeutic angiogenic strategy has been proposed to alleviate ischemia-induced injury by promoting angiogenesis and improving cerebrovascular function in the ischemic regions. The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)/insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) axis is crucial for cerebral angiogenesis and neurogenesis. However, effective drugs that prevent cerebral ischemic injury by inducing cerebral angiogenesis via activation of the IGF1R pathway are lacking. Here, we screened a pro-angiogenic agent ginsenoside F1 (GF1), a ginseng saponin isolated from a traditional Chinese medicine that was widely used in ischemic stroke treatment. It promoted the proliferation, mobility and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human brain microvascular endothelial cells, as well as pericytes recruitment to the endothelial tubes. GF1 stimulated vessel sprouting in the rat arterial ring and facilitated neovascularization in chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). In the in vivo experiments, GF1 rescued the axitinib-induced vascular defect in zebrafish. It also increased the microvessel density (MVD) and improved focal cerebral blood perfusion in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Mechanism studies revealed that GF1-induced angiogenesis depended on IGF1R activation mediated by the autocrine IGF-1 loop in endothelial cells. Based on our findings, GF1-induced activation of the IGF-1/IGF1R pathway to promote angiogenesis is an effective approach to alleviate cerebral ischemia, and GF1 is a potential agent that improves cerebrovascular function and promotes recovery from ischemic stroke.

31157895|t|Traditional Chinese medicine treatment post-stroke and a significant reduction in presentation to healthcare providers.
30778546|t|Reduced use of emergency care and hospitalization in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment treated with traditional Chinese medicine.
30778546|a|BACKGROUND: The effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on the outcomes of dementia remains unclear. Our purpose is to compare the use of emergency care and hospitalization in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) with or without treatment of TCM. METHODS: In a stroke cohort of 67 521 patients with PSCI aged over 40 years obtained from the 23 million people in Taiwan's national health insurance between 2000 and 2007, we identified 6661 newly diagnosed PSCI patients who were treated with TCM and 6661 propensity score-matched PSCI patients who were not treated with TCM. Under the control of immortal time bias, we calculated the adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs of the 1-year use of emergency care and hospitalization associated with TCM. RESULTS: The means of the emergency care medical visits (0.40 ± 0.98 vs. 0.47 ± 1.01, P = 0.0001) and hospitalization (0.72 ± 1.29 vs. 0.96 ± 1.49, P < 0.0001) were lower in the PSCI patients treated with TCM than in those without the TCM treatment. The RRs of emergency care and hospitalization associated with TCM were 0.87 (95% CI = 0.82-0.92) and 0.81 (95% CI = 0.78-0.84), respectively. The PSCI patients treated with a combination of acupuncture and herbal medicine had the lowest risk of emergency care visits and hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Our study raises the possibility that TCM use was associated with reduced use of emergency care and hospitalization after PSCI. However, further randomized clinical trials are needed to provide solid evidence of this benefit and identify the underlying mechanism.

31359726|t|[Anti-inflammatory mechanism of Xixian Tongshuan Preparation based on molecular simulation methods].
31359726|a|Inflammatory response is caused by exogenous and endogenous stimuli,resulting in a non-specific resistance reaction.After acute ischemic cerebral infarction,inflammatory factors gather and adhere in the ischemic area of leukocyte infiltration,and the released inflammatory factors causes the injury cascade,aggravate the brain tissue damage and the symptoms of neurological deficits,and hinder the repair of brain neurons and the recovery of nerve function. In this paper,the key targets in the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway were studied. The Hiphop pharmacophore model of s PLA2-ⅡA and COX-2 inhibitors was built. According tothe two previously constructed 5-LOX and LTA4 H target inhibitors,the pharmacophore model was used to initially screen out the composition database of all of 13 traditional Chinese medicines in Xixian Tongshuan Preparation. The molecular matching study was carried out by selecting the matching value greater than 0. 6,and the component with the CDOCKER score greater than 80% of the original ligand score was used as the potential active inhibitor of the target. Considering the pharmacophore matching value,the molecular docking score and the interaction between the components and the target,one Chuanxiong component and one safflower component were selected as potential inhibitors of s PLA2-ⅡA; two Chuanxiong components,two Panax notoginseng,one safflower component,one angelica component,one valerian component were taken as a potential inhibitor of COX-2; two Gentiana components,one safflower component,one valerian component,one P. notoginseng component and one Angelica component were taken as potential inhibitors of 5-LOX; and two Gentiana components,two Chuanxiong components,and two safflower components were taken as potential inhibitors of LTA4 H. This study screened out the potential inhibitors of the four targets in a high-efficiency and low-cost manner,and explained that Xixian Tongshuan Preparation showed an effect in the treatment of inflammatory responses caused by ischemic stroke by acting both LOX pathway and COX pathway in the metabolic pathway.

31359663|t|[Multi-target neuroprotective effect of Xixian Tongshuan Preparation against cerebral ischemia injury].
31359663|a|In this paper, Xixian Tongshuan Preparation was used as the research object, and all the chemical components of the 13 traditional Chinese medicines were collected. The target finding technique was used to obtain the key targets of the neuroprotective effect of Xixian Tongshuan Preparation, including 5 glutamate receptors, TGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. Molecular docking technology was used to screen out the potential active components of the above targets and to analyze their mechanism of action. It was found that single component, such as neo-complanatoside and neo-carthamin, in Xixian Tongshuan Preparation could simultaneously act on different targets. The chemical constituents in Ligusticum chuanxiong, Angelica sinensis, Carthamus tinctorius, and Panax pseudo-ginseng could simultaneously act on different neuroprotective-related targets, which reflected the application of multi-components to multi-targets. Point and multiple sites played a key role in protecting neurons against cerebral ischemic injury. This study explains the multi-target mechanism of anti-cerebral ischemic injury in neuroprotection at the molecular level, and provides a certain direction for the clinical application and experimental research of Xixian Tongshuan Preparation.

30836247|t|Using 3D-UPLC-DAD and a new method-verification by adding mixture standard compounds to determine the fingerprint and eight active components of Naoluoxintong decoction.
30836247|a|Naoluoxintong decoction (NLXTD) is a traditional Chinese formula which has been used for the management of ischemic stroke in China for two hundred years. In this study, we developed a comprehensive and reliable analytical method to qualitatively analyze the components in NLXTD. This novel method was based on three-dimensional ultra-fast high performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (3D-UPLC-DAD) with an additional component validation method via incorporation of the mixture standard compounds during the verification step. In addition, the relationship between active components and "Monarch drug, Minster drug, Assistant drug, Guide drug" were determined. Our results showed that gradient elution with the mobile phase of 0.02% formic acid and methanol was the optimum condition to separate peaks. A total of 35 common peaks were established by comparing ten batches of NLXTD, and eight components were identified, including Calycosin, Calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside and Ononin in Astragali radix (Monarch drug); Ligustrazine in Chuanxiong Rhizoma (Minster drug); 4-Hydroxbenzyl alcohol and Parishin A in Gastrodiae rhizome (Assistant drug); Ferulic acid in Angelicae sinensis radix (Guide drug). The validation method of verification by adding mixture standard compounds combined with 3D-UPLC-DAD method, with the merits of greater resolution, higher speed of analysis and higher sensitivity, provided a semi-quantitative and qualitative analysis method to assess traditional Chinese medicinal prescription consisting of many bio-active components. Finally, our study has provided systemic and scientific evidence to explain the relationship between the bio-active components in the NLXTD and traditional Chinese medicine theory.

31142338|t|Assessing the performance of monocyte to high-density lipoprotein ratio for predicting ischemic stroke: insights from a population-based Chinese cohort.
31142338|a|BACKGROUND: Monocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) is a recently emerged measure of inflammation and oxidative stress and has been used to predict multiple cardiovascular abnormalities, but data relative to ischemic stroke are lacking. The goal of this study was to estimate the associations of MHR and prevalent ischemic stroke among a large cohort of general Chinese population. METHOD: The study analyzed 8148 individuals (mean age: 54.1 years; 45.7% males) enrolled in a cross-sectional population-based Northeast China Rural Cardiovascular Health Study (NCRCHS). We identified 194 patients admitted from January and August 2013 with ischemic stroke. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, and potential confounders, each standard deviation (SD) increment of MHR was predictive to a greater odd of ischemic stroke (odds ratio, 1.276; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.082-1.504), with subjects in the highest quartile of MHR levels having a 1.6-fold higher risk of prevalent ischemic stroke (95% CI, 1.045-2.524) as compared with those in the lowest quartile. Moreover, smoothing curve showed a linear positive pattern of this association. The area under the curve (AUC) significantly increased (P = 0.042) to 0.808 (95% CI, 0.779-0.837) when the combined MHR was added to the baseline logistic regression model with ischemic stroke risk factors. Also, MHR (0.004) significantly improved integrated discrimination improvement when added to the baseline model. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated for the first time a linear relation between MHR levels and the odds of ischemic stroke in a large community-based population. The MHR, a marker of high atherosclerotic burden, demonstrated incremental predictive value over traditional clinical risk factors, thus providing clinical utility in risk stratification in subjects presenting with ischemic stroke. These findings had implications for strategies aimed at lowering MHR to prevent adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes.

31146772|t|Effect of acupuncture on insomnia in menopausal women: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
31146772|a|BACKGROUND: The National Institutes of Health estimates the prevalence of insomnia in menopausal women at 40-50%. Some studies have shown that acupuncture might be effective in treating primary insomnia and insomnia related to depression and stroke. Although there are some programs supporting insomnia during the menopausal transition, there are few randomized controlled trials (RCT) to provide evidence regarding their effectiveness. We design a RCT of suitable sample size to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture in patients with insomnia during the menopausal transition and to form an optimized acupuncture treatment protocol. METHOD/DESIGN: In this randomized, single-site, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 84 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group (n = 42) or the sham control group (n = 42) in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will receive a total of 18 treatment sessions for eight consecutive weeks. Treatments will be given three times per week in the first four weeks, twice a week for the next two weeks, and finally once weekly for the final two weeks. Treatment will utilize eight main acupoints (GV20, GV24, GV29, RN6, RN4, SP6, HT7, EX-HN22) and extra two acupoints based on syndrome differentiation. The primary outcome will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The secondary outcomes will be measured by sleep parameters recorded in the Actigraphy (SE, TST, SA), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Menopause Quality of Life (Men-QOL). The primary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 4, week 8, and the first and third month after the end of treatment. DISCUSSION: If the results confirm that acupuncture is effective and safe for the treatment on insomnia in menopausal women, this positive outcome could provide evidence for clinical application. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1800018645 . Registered on 10 January 2018.

31184076|t|[Progress of Telerehabilitation Techniques in Stroke Patients with Lower Extremity Dysfunction].
31184076|a|Stroke has the characteristics of high prevalence, high morbidity, and high mortality, which seriously affects life quality of patients and also creates a huge social burden. Telerehabilitation technology is on the basis of traditional rehabilitation equipment and it integrates with cloud computing and big data technologies. It provides a new way for rehabilitation by providing comprehensive rehabilitation technology and service based on the cloud platform. Therefore, it provides a solution for the situation that the rehabilitation medical resources and the rehabilitation talents in China are relatively insufficient. This article mainly discusses the telerehabilitation technologies of lower extremity motor dysfunction in patients with stroke, the problems and the future development direction.

31191223|t|Ginseng-Angelica-Sansheng-Pulvis Boosts Neurogenesis Against Focal Cerebral Ischemia-Induced Neurological Deficiency.
31191223|a|Background: The traditional Chinese medicine Ginseng-Angelica-Shanseng-Pulvis (GASP) has been used to treat stroke for 300 years. This present study investigated if it can induce increases in neurogenesis following cerebral ischemic injury. Methods: Rats following middle cerebral artery occlusion were orally treated with high, medium, and low doses of a standardized GASP extract. Results: After 14 days, treatment with GASP improved regional blood flow and infarction volume by magnetic resonance imaging scanning, enhanced Ki67+ expression in the subventricular zone, increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secretion, Nestin, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2/4 expressions in the hippocampus in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, low-dose treatment with GASP downregulated doublecortin and Notch1 expressions in the hippocampus, as well as upregulated glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in the subgranular zone and hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) 5 expression in the hippocampus, while treatment with middle and high doses of GASP reversed these results. Meanwhile, the consumed time was shortened in the basket test and the adhesive removal test and the spending time on exploring novel objects was prolonged by GASP treatment whose effects were more obvious at day 14 post-ischemia. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that treatment with GASP increases neurogenesis and ameliorates sensorimotor functions and recognition memory. We hypothesize that these effects are thought be mediated by an effect on the BMP2/4 pathway and Notch1/Hes5 signal. Due to its beneficial efficacy, GASP can be recognized as an alternative therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke.

31191319|t|Neuroprotective Effects and Hepatorenal Toxicity of Angong Niuhuang Wan Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Brain Injury in Rats.
31191319|a|Angong Niuhuang Wan (AGNHW) is a classic prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used for stroke treatment, but its efficacies remain to be confirmed. With its arsenic- and mercury-containing materials, the application of AGNHW raises great safety concerns. Herein, we aim to explore the neuropharmacological effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and evaluate the toxicological effects of AGNHW for better use. Male SD rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and following 22 h of reperfusion. AGNHW (257 mg/kg, 1× AGNHW) were orally administered for pharmacological effects and 257, 514, and 1,028 mg/kg (equivalent to 1×, 2×, 4× AGNHW) were used for the toxicological study. The results revealed that AGNHW treatment reduced the infarct size and protected the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in the MCAO rat ischemic stroke model. AGNHW treatment up-regulated bcl-2 expression and down-regulated the expressions of Bax, p47phox, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and inhibited the expressions and activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and reserved tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5 in the ischemic brains. These results indicated that the neuroprotective mechanisms of AGNHW could be associated with its antioxidant properties by inhibiting oxidative/nitrative stress-mediated MMP activation and protecting tight junction proteins in the ischemic brains. Administration of 1× AGNHW for 7 days would not induce the accumulation of mercury in blood, liver, and kidney at day 14. Administration of 2× AGNHW and 4× AGNHW for 7 days increased the level of mercury in the kidney. For arsenic level, administration of 1× AGNHW for 7 days would increase the level of arsenic in the liver and blood without increase of arsenic in the kidney at day 14. Administration of 2× AGNHW and 4× AGNHW for 7 days would further increase the level of arsenic in the liver and blood. There is no influence on body weight, organ index, histological structures, and renal and liver functions. These results suggest that short-term treatment of AGNHW within 1 week should be safe and has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

31155873|t|[Features of clinical application of eye acupuncture therapy revealed by data mining].
31155873|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the features, dominant indications and application regularities of eye acupuncture therapy in clinical practice. METHODS: We first collected original articles, academic dissertations, conference articles, and case reports from databases of CNKI, Wanfang, and Chinese biomedical literature (CBM) from Jan. 1 of 1980 to Dec. 31 of 2017, and medical records from medical books of Zhonghua Yan Zhen (Chinese Eye Acupuncture Therapy), Yanzhen Shijian Lu (Records of Application of Eye Acupuncture Therapy), and Peng Jing-shan's Yanzhen Liaofa Yanjiu (Peng Jing-shan's Eye Acupuncture Therapy) by using keyword of "eye acupuncture". Then, we established an "Eye-acupuncture Database" after sorting, screening, typing-in, checking, and extraction of the collected data by SQL server 2005 and 2005 Analysis Services (SASS), followed by analysis of the dominant indications, needling methods, needle manipulations, principles for acupoint selection, and clinical effect. RESULTS: Among the 850 articles retrieved, 178 were eligible to be subjected to analysis, including 42 disorders/diseases in 7 categories. The eye acupuncture therapy has the highest application frequency for 19 types of disorders/diseases of the internal medicine, such as sequela of apoplexy, hiccup, insomnia, vertigo, hypertension, etc., followed by head and body pain (7 types: headache, lumbago, sciatica, shoulder pain, etc.), disorders of the ophthalmology and otorhinolaryngology (deafness, squinting eyes, dry eye syndrome, amblyopia, etc.), traumatic injury, gynecopathy, acute pain (biliary colic, renal colic). The effect rate was 95.87% for disorders of the gynecopathy, 95.54% for head and body pain, 94.53% for traumatic skin injury, 92.16% for emergency, 91.98% for disorders of the five sense organs, 91.43% for problems of the internal medicine, etc. Regarding the principle of acupoint selection, acupoints were chosen mainly according to the meridian running (146 articles), local region of the eye (14 articles) and diseased location (153 articles). A total of 157 articles have a marked description about the needling methods, including horizontal needling (81 articles), intra-orbital straight needling (22 articles), extra-orbital oblique needling (13 articles), etc. The duration of needle retaining was mostly from 15 to 30 minutes, and the handle-scraping was frequently adopted (34 articles), and the overall treatment frequency ranged from 11 to 20 times. In regard to the medical records, a total of 53 types of disorders were involved, including 37 types of the internal medicine such as stroke sequelae (34 articles), facial paralysis (11 articles), etc. The acupoints were selected according to the local region of eye (129 articles), the needle insertion involved horizontal needling (102 articles), and cured rate reported was higher than 90%. CONCLUSION: Eye acupuncture therapy is widely used for a variety of disorders and has a positive effect, particularly for stroke sequelae and various acute and chronic pain problems.

31155871|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic effect of fire-needling plus stuck-needle-stretching and conventional acupuncture for post-stroke foot drop, so as to provide a reference foundation for optimizing clinical treatment regimen. METHODS: A total of 60 patients with post-stroke foot drop were equally randomized into a treatment group and a control group. In the treatment group, fire-needling plus stuck-needle-stretching was applied to acupoint pairs Jiexi (ST41)-Taichong (LR3), Xiajuxu (ST39)-ST41, Fenglong (ST40)-ST39, shangjuxu (ST37)-ST40, Zusanli (ST36)-ST37, Dubi (ST35)-ST36, Xuanzhong (GB39)-Qiuxu (GB40) on the affected side, and Chengshan (BL57) and Ashi points were swiftly pricked with red-hot filiform needle without needle retaining. In the conventional acupuncture group, the same acupoints were needled with filiform needles, and the treatment for both groups was given once a day, 6 times a week, for consecutive 4 weeks. The spasm severity of posterior triceps of the lower leg was evaluated using modified Ashworth scale, the tibial anterior muscle strength was measured using Lovett' and Martin's methods, the activities of daily living were assessed using modified Barthel's index, the walking ability was evaluated using Holden walking rating scale and the lower limb motor function assessed using Fugl-Meyer assessment scale, and the severity of foot drop was assessed in reference to Garceau criteria. RESULTS: After the treatment, the score of the modified Ashworth scale was significantly reduced (P<0.01), and those of Lovett muscle strength scale, Barthel index, Holden walking rating scale and Fugl-Meyer lower limb motor function scale were considerably increased in both groups versus their own pre-treatment (P<0.01). The therapeutic effect of the treatment group was significantly superior to that of the control group in reducing Ashworth scale score and in increasing the scores of Lovett muscle strength test, Barthel index, Holden walking function scale and Fugl-Meyer lower limb motor function scale (P<0.01). Of the two 30 cases in the control and treatment groups, 10(33.33%)and 14(46.67%) experienced a remarkable improvement, 10(33.33%)and 12(40.00%)were improved, 7(23.33%)and 3(10.00%)had a mild progress, 3(10.00%) and 1(3.33%) failed, with the excellent plus good effective rates being 66.67% and 86.67%, respectively, but without significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Both fire-needling plus stuck-needle-stretching and conventional acupuncture are effective in the treatment of post-stroke foot drop, but the former is relatively better.

31155870|t|[Clinical trials of treatment of post-stroke neurogenic bladder by plum-blossom needle tapping plus moxibustion].
31155870|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of plum-blossom needle tapping plus moxibustion in the treatment of post-stroke neurogenic bladder(PSNB). METHODS: A total of 60 PSNB patients were equally randomized into control group (16 men and 14 women, 65.6±7.9 years in age, 10.1±6.3 months in the duration of disease) and treatment group (18 men and 12 women, 63.8±8.5 years in age, 9.8±6.5 months in the duration of disease). Patients of the control group were treated by asking the patients to make a pelvic muscular exercise and passive intermittent urethral catheterization. For patients of the treatment group, a plum-blossom needle was used to alternatively tap the bilateral Shenshu(BL23), Qihaishu(BL24), Guanyuanshu(BL26), Xiaochangshu(BL27), Pangguangshu(BL28), Huiyang(BL35), Shangliao(BL31), etc., followed by performing moxibustion over the skin of Shenque(CV8), Guanyuan(CV4), Qihai(CV6) and Zhongji(CV3), etc. about 15 min. In addition, patients without spontaneous urination were also received urethral catheterization as those in the control group. The treatment was given once every day except the weekends and for two months. The integrated symptom score was assessed. The frequencies of diurnal urination and urinary incontinence, and the urination volume every time were respectively recorded for consecutive 3 days before and after the treatment, and the residual urine volume was also measured. The therapeutic effect was evaluated based on the status and frequency of diurnal urination and residual urine volume each time. RESULTS: Of the two 30 cases in the control and treatment groups, 2(6.7%) and 5(16.7%) were cured, 8(26.7%) and 12(40.0%) experienced marked improvement in their symptoms, 13(43.3%) and 11(36.7%) were improved, 7(23.3%) and 2(6.7%) failed, with the effective rates being 76.7% and 93.3%, respectively. The effective rate of the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group(P<0.05). After the treatment, the integrated symptom score, residual urine volume, and frequencies of diurnal urination and urinary incontinence were significantly decreased, and the diurnal urination volume was obviously increased in comparison with their own pre-treatment in both groups(all P<0.05)． The therapeutic effect of the treatment group was significantly superior to that of the control group in reducing the integrated symptom score, residual urine volume, and frequencies of diurnal urination and urinary incontinence(P<0.05), and in increasing the diurnal urination volume(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Plum-blossom needle tapping plus moxibustion is an effective option for the treatment of PSNB in improving symptoms, in reducing the residual urine volume and frequencies of diurnal urination and urinary incontinence, and in increasing the diurnal urination volume, deserving being promoted in primary care.

31178893|t|A Systems Analysis of the Relationships Between Anemia and Ischemic Stroke Rehabilitation Based on RNA-Seq Data.
31178893|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the main causes of morbidity and disability worldwide due to its complex mechanism. Anemia was characterized as a risk factor of IS because the direct connection between central nervous system, blood supply, and tissue oxygen delivery. As the key oxygen-carrying molecule in the blood, hemoglobin (Hb) may be decisive in the destiny of penumbral area or influence the brain recovery and neurologic function, which could finally affect the outcome of IS. However, more detailed information on the expression levels of Hb related genes were still lacking possibly because the concentration of Hb was determined by the genes' expression several hours ago, which may make the research more difficult to perform. This time gap between gene expressions and protein concentration could make these genes predictive bio-markers for IS outcome. In this study, we choose 28 IS patients, of which 12 were suffering from anemia. Statistical analysis results showed that the outcomes of the patients were different when dividing them into two groups characterized by Hb concentration. 2 sex and age matched patients were first chosen to perform RNA-seq analysis on, on two occasions at two different time points, after which the Hb counts were tested at least 24 h after sequencing. Results showed that the outcome of anemia patients was poor compared with non-anemia patients. Two other patients were then chosen for analysis which excluded the coincidence of other factors. The results showed that the low value of Hb under 13 g/dL in men were closely related to the poor outcome of IS patients. Differently expressed Hb related genes were tested and six genes were shown to be positively correlated with the recovery degree of IS patients: ELANE, FGF23, HBB, PIEZO1, RASA4, and PRTN3. Gene CPM was shown to be negatively correlated with clinical outcomes. All of the seven genes were validated to be related to strokes using real-time PCR or literature searches. Taken together, these genes could be considered as new predictors for the recovery of IS patients.

31190842|t|Antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects of electroacupuncture through sonic hedgehog-signaling pathway in a rat model of poststroke depression.
31190842|a|Background: Poststroke depression (PSD) is the most frequent psychological sequela after stroke. Electroacupuncture (EA) treatment is effective for PSD. The study aimed at clarifying the mechanisms of EA's antidepressant effects in a PSD rat model. Methods: We used middle cerebral artery occlusion to establish the rat model of PSD. Tests of sucrose preference and locomotor activity were performed to examine depressive-like behaviors. We measured malondialdehyde, GSH, SOD, IL6, IL1β, TNFα, and 5HT with ELISA. The hippocampal Shh-signaling pathway was assessed by Western blot. Results: EA significantly decreased sucrose preference and locomotor activities of PSD rats, reduced IL6, TNFα, increased GSH, and upregulated 5HT, and also slightly reduced IL1β and malondialdehyde, all of which were measured with ELISA. The Shh-signaling pathway assessed by Western blotting was activated by EA. Those changes were inhibited by the Shh-pathway inhibitor cyclopamine. Conclusion: EA effectively alleviated depressive-like behaviors in PSD by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress through activation of the Shh-signaling pathway.

31139246|t|The effects of bioactive components from the rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) on the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease.
31139246|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common human neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by the progressive loss of memory and the cognitive impairment. Since the etiology of AD is still unknown, it is extremely difficult to develop the effective drugs for preventing or slowing the AD process. The major characteristics of AD such as amyloid β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy dysfunction are commonly used as the important indicators for evaluating the effects of potential candidate drugs. The rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza (known as 'Danshen' in Chinese), a famous traditional Chinese medicine, which is widely used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, stroke, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Increasing evidences suggest that the bioactive components of Danshen can improve cognitive deficits in mice, protect neuronal cells, reduce tau hyperphosylation, prevent amyloid-β fiber formation and disaggregation. Here we briefly summarize the studies regarding the effects of bioactive component from Danshen on those major characteristics of AD in preclinical studies, as well as explore the potential of these Danshen component in the treatment of AD.

31110106|t|Long-term unmet needs after stroke: systematic review of evidence from survey studies.
31110106|a|OBJECTIVES: To synthesise evidence on longer term unmet needs perceived by stroke survivors, and psychometric properties of the tools used to evaluate unmet care needs after stroke. DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING: Community or patients' home. PARTICIPANTS: Stroke survivors. METHODS: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE from inception to 31 March 2018 to identify survey studies that evaluated unmet needs perceived by stroke survivors after hospital discharge. Reported unmet needs were categorised under three domains: body functioning, activity/participation and environmental factors. Ranges of prevalence rates of unmet needs reported in studies were presented. RESULTS: We included 19 eligible studies, with considerable heterogeneity in patients, survey methods and results. Psychometric properties of two stroke-specific tools were formally evaluated, indicating their moderate reliability and content/concurrent validity. The median number of reported unmet needs per stroke survivor was from two to five, and the proportion of stroke survivors with at least one unmet needs was on average 73.8% (range 19.8%- 91.7%). Unmet needs perceived by stroke survivors included 55 records of unmet body functioning needs, 47 records of unmet activities/participatory needs and 101 records of unmet environmental needs. Common unmet service needs were unmet information needs (3.1%- 65.0%), transport (5.4%-53.0%), home help/personal care (4.7%-39.3%) and therapy (2.0%-35.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of unmet long-term needs is high among stroke survivors, and there is considerable heterogeneity in type and frequency of specific unmet needs. More research is required to link regular assessment of long-term unmet needs of stroke survivors with the provision of cost-effective patient-centred health and social care services.

These different anthraquinone derivatives alone or in combination play a therapeutic role in central nervous system diseases (CNSD), such as cerebral ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and others. We review the experimental studies on these six anthraquinones in the treatment of CNSD by consulting literature published in the last 20 years in PubMed and then give a future perspective on it. In the end of this paper some deficiencies related to these studies also have been pointed out.

31223330|t|Proteomic Assessment of iTRAQ-Based NaoMaiTong in the Treatment of Ischemic Stroke in Rats.
31223330|a|Background: NaoMaiTong (NMT) is widely used in the treatment of cerebral ischemia but the molecular details of its beneficial effects remain poorly characterized. Materials and Methods: In this study, we used iTRAQ using 2D LC-MS/MS technology to investigate the cellular mechanisms governing the protective effects of NMT. The transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was established and evaluated. The degree of cerebral ischemia was assessed through scoring for nerve injury symptoms and through the assessment of the areas of cerebral infarction. Brain tissues were subjected to analysis by iTRAQ. High-pH HPLC and RSLC-MS/MS analysis were performed to detect differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the treatment groups (Sham, MCAO, and NMT). Bioinformatics were employed for data analysis and DEPs were validated by western blot. Results: The results showed that NMT offers protection to the neurological damage caused by MCAO and was found to reduce the areas of cerebral infarction. We detected 3216 DEPs via mass spectrometry. Of these proteins, 21 displayed altered expression following NMT intervention. These included DEPs involved in translation, cell cycle regulation, cellular nitrogen metabolism, and stress responses. Pathway analysis revealed seven key DEPs that were enriched in ribosomal synthesis pathways, tight junction formation, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. According to protein-protein interaction analysis, RPL17, Tuba, and Rac1 were affected by NMT treatment, which was validated by western blot analysis. Discussion: We therefore identify new pharmacodynamic mechanisms of NMT for the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke. These DEPs reveal new targets to prevent ischemic stroke induced neuronal damage.

31217804|t|Effect of Electroacupuncture on Hyperalgesia and Vasoactive Neurotransmitters in a Rat Model of Conscious Recurrent Migraine.
31217804|a|Migraine onset is associated with the abnormal release of vasoactive neurotransmitters from perivascular nerves, and these neurotransmitters are involved in the pathophysiology of migraine. Hyperalgesia is a key feature of migraine, and accumulating evidence indicates that electroacupuncture (EA) at the single acupuncture point (Fengchi [GB20]) is effective in ameliorating hyperalgesia. In clinical practice, multiple acupuncture points are widely used, especially GB20 and Yanglingquan (GB34). However, the role played by vasoactive neurotransmitters in acupuncture antihyperalgesic effect at the single or multiple acupuncture points remains unknown. We aimed to determine whether EA would exert its antihyperalgesic effects by modulating vasoactive neurotransmitter release from the perivascular nerves. Furthermore, we examined whether targeting multiple acupuncture points would be more effective than targeting a single point in reducing hyperalgesia. The mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated by measuring the facial and hind-paw mechanical withdrawal thresholds, tail-flick and hot-plate latencies. Plasma concentrations of vasoactive neurotransmitters were determined using rat-specific ELISA kits from jugular vein, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), nitric oxide (NO), and endothelin-1 (ET-1). The result suggested that EA significantly ameliorated the mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, reduced c-Fos levels in the trigeminal ganglion, and attenuated plasma and dural levels of vasoactive neurotransmitters, especially in the multiple acupuncture points group (GB20+GB34). In conclusion, EA exerts antihyperalgesic effect in a rat model of conscious recurrent migraine, possibly via modulation of the vasoactive neurotransmitters. Furthermore, targeting multiple acupuncture points is more effective than targeting a single point in reducing hyperalgesia.

31091030|t|Risk of Dementia Among Individuals With Psoriasis: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study in Taiwan.
31091030|a|OBJECTIVE: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease putatively associated with dementia. However, the epidemiologic evidence of the relationship between psoriasis and dementia has been limited. We used a large national sample to investigate this relationship as well as the association between systemic therapy for psoriasis and incident dementia. METHODS: The cases were identified as a first recorded diagnosis of psoriasis (ICD-9-CM codes: 696.0, 696.1, or 696.8) between 1996 and 2013 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Each selected case of psoriasis was compared with 4 sex-, age-, and urbanization-matched comparison subjects. The first diagnosis of dementia (ICD-9-CM codes: 290.0-290.4, 294.1-294.2, 331.0-331.2, or 331.82) that covered vascular and nonvascular subtypes until the end of 2013 was tracked in both groups. Cox regression analyses and a competing risk model were applied to evaluate the risk, adjusting for sex, urbanization, age, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, stroke, and depression. The association between systemic therapy and incidence of dementia in the psoriasis group was examined in further stratified analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 3,820 patients with psoriasis and 15,280 comparisons were identified. After adjustment, a significantly higher risk of dementia was identified in the psoriasis group than in the comparison group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06-1.42). A significant association between psoriasis and dementia was identified for nonvascular dementia (aHR = 1.25, 95% CI, 1.07-1.45) but not for vascular dementia (aHR = 1.27, 95% CI, 0.83-1.93). Receiving systemic therapy for psoriasis for more than 90 days significantly reduced the risk of developing dementia compared with no systemic therapy (aHR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97). Compared with those who received no systemic therapy, the patients who received disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and/or biologics had a significantly lower risk of dementia incidence (aHR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50-0.97), which was not the case in patients who received only phototherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with psoriasis have a significantly higher incidence of dementia, particularly the nonvascular type. Systemic therapy might be protective in preventing dementia in patients with psoriasis.

31086027|t|A NMR-Based Metabonomics Approach to Determine Protective Effect of a Combination of Multiple Components Derived from Naodesheng on Ischemic Stroke Rats.
31086027|a|Naodesheng (NDS) is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription for the treatment of ischemic stroke. A combination of 10 components is derived from NDS. They are: Notoginsenoside R1, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside b1, ginsenoside Rd, hydroxysafflor yellow A, senkyunolide I, puerarin, daidzein, vitexin, and ferulic acid. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of the ten-component combination derived from NDS (TCNDS) on ischemic stroke rats with a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model by integrating an NMR-based metabonomics approach with biochemical assessment. Our results showed that TCNDS could improve neurobehavioral function, decrease the cerebral infarct area, and ameliorate pathological features in MCAO model rats. In addition, TCNDS was found to decrease plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) production and increase plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) production. Furthermore, 1H-NMR metabonomic analysis indicated that TCNDS could regulate the disturbed metabolites in the plasma, urine, and brain tissue of MCAO rats, and the possible mechanisms were involved oxidative stress, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and inflammation. Correlation analysis were then performed to further confirm the metabolites involved in oxidative stress. Correlation analysis showed that six plasma metabolites had high correlations with plasma LDH, MDA, and SOD. This study provides evidence that an NMR-based metabonomics approach integrated with biochemical assessment can help to better understand the underlying mechanisms as well as the holistic effect of multiple compounds from TCM.

30968600|t|Metformin reduces prostate cancer risk among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia: A nationwide population-based cohort study.
30968600|a|Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) has been associated with prostate cancer prevalent among men after 50 years of age, however, it is unclear whether the antidiabetic drug, metformin, can reduce prostate cancer for men with BPH. The insurance claims data of men aged 50 years or older, with both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and BPH diagnosed from 1997 to 2007 were analyzed. Individuals were followed up for at least 5 years. We identified 2906 and 2906 patients as the metformin cohort and nonmetformin cohort, respectively. The Cox method analysis showed that the metformin cohort had an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49-0.96, P = 0.0298) for prostate cancer, compared to the nonmetformin cohort after controlling for age, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) use, prostate specific antigen, and Charlson comorbidity index. Patients using TCM for BPH (per 6 months) also had an aHR of 0.41 (95% CI = 0.24-0.69; P = 0.0009). In conclusion, both metformin medication and TCM use could be associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer for men with BPH and diabetes.

30875672|t|Acupuncture treatment is associated with a decreased risk of developing stroke in patients with depression: A propensity-score matched cohort study.
30875672|a|BACKGROUND: Depression had a significantly increased risk of stroke. Some patients with depression seek acupuncture treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between acupuncture treatment and risk of developing stroke in patients with depression. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed depression above 18 years old between 1997 and 2010 were selected from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database, and followed up until the end of 2013. The 1:1 propensity score method was used to match an equal number of patients (N = 13,823) in the acupuncture and non-acupuncture cohorts, based on characteristics including sex, age, baseline comorbidity and drug used. The outcome measurement was the comparison of stroke incidence in the two cohorts. We used the Cox regression model and the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the risk of developing stroke. RESULTS: Compared with the non-acupuncture cohort, patients who received acupuncture treatment had a lower risk of stroke (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49, 95% confidential interval = 0.45-0.52) after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities and drugs used. Regarding the two types of stroke, acupuncture users also had lower risk of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke (adjusted HR = 0.37 and 0.49, respectively). The cumulative incidence of stroke in the acupuncture cohort was significantly lower than that of the non-acupuncture cohort (log-rank test, p < 0.001). At the 5th year of follow-up, 7.22% of acupuncture users had stroke onset compared with 14% in the non-acupuncture cohort. LIMITATIONS: The database provided information of antidepressants but not the severity of depression. Details of the life style and selection of acupoints were also not provided. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that acupuncture reduced the risk of developing stroke in depression patients in Taiwan. Further clinical studies investigating the mechanisms and efficacy of acupuncture are warranted.

30855407|t|Ligustilide Ameliorates the Permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier Model In Vitro During Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation Injury Through HIF/VEGF Pathway.
30855407|a|Chuanxiong rhizome has been widely used for the treatment of cerebral vascular disease in traditional Chinese medicine. The integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB) is closely linked to the cerebral vascular disease. The protective effects of ligustilide, the major bioactive component in Chuanxiong rhizome, on cerebral blood vessels have been reported previously, but its effects and potential mechanism on BBB have not been entirely clarified. In the current work, the effects of ligustilide on BBB permeability and the underlying molecular mechanisms had been investigated using the model of BBB established by coculturing astrocytes and brain microvascular endothelial cells isolated from the rat brain. The ischemia-damaged model of BBB has been established with oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Our results indicated that OGD significantly increased the permeability in the coculture BBB model. This OGD-induced increase in permeability could suppress by ligustilide in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, ligustilide promoted both gene and protein expression of tight junction proteins. Ligustilide suppressed the upregulation of HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and AQP-4 in the BBB model induced by OGD. Collectively, all results have demonstrated that ligustilide is capable of reducing the permeability of BBB in vitro model induced by OGD through HIF-1α/vascular endothelial growth factor pathway and AQP-4, which provide a new target for the clinical application of ligustilide on BBB after stroke in future.

30482569|t|Combination of left atrial appendage closure and catheter ablation in a single procedure for patients with atrial fibrillation: Multicenter experience.
30482569|a|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Experience in procedures combining left atrial appendage (LAA) closure (LAAC) and catheter ablation (CA) was scarce in Chinese nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with high risks for stroke and bleeding. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy with LAAC and AF CA in a single procedure based on the multicenter data and medium-term follow-up results. METHODS: A total of 122 AF patients with a mean CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4.3 ± 1.4 and HAS-BLED score of 3.3 ± 1.0 were enrolled. The Watchman (n = 83) devices were implanted either before or after AF ablations in the same procedure, while the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (ACP, n = 39) devices were implanted immediately after CA. AF recurrence and transesophageal echocardiography results were evaluated. RESULTS: All devices were successfully implanted and acute complete LAA occlusions were achieved in 115 (94.3%) of patients. Neither acute nor chronic peri-device leaks greater than 5 mm were detected. Oral anticoagulation was held in all patients but two with asymptomatic device-related thrombi, which were resolved after prolonged anticoagulation. AF-free success rate without antiarrhythmic drugs was 76.2% after a mean follow-up of 11.5 ± 6.8 months. No serious complications were observed during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: The combination therapy with LAAC and AF ablation in a single procedure was efficacious and safe in the Chinese symptomatic AF population with high risk for stroke and bleeding.

30922849|t|Fire-needle acupuncture for upper limb spastic paralysis after stroke: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
30922849|a|BACKGROUND: Fire-needle acupuncture, an important kind of acupuncture therapy, has been clinically used to treat upper limb spastic paralysis (ULSP) after stroke. Clinical experience has indicated that fire-needle acupuncture treatment takes less time, requires fewer visits, and has more rapid results and fewer side effects compared to chemical medicine alternatives. This study will evaluate the effects of fire-needle acupuncture for ULSP in the context of standardized clinical research and provide high-quality data to inform clinical procedures and future study design. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial will be carried out to evaluate the effects of fire-needle acupuncture therapy in patients with ULSP from stroke. ULSP patients (n = 120) will be recruited at Changhai Hospital in Shanghai, China. Patients will be randomly divided into three groups, including fire-needle acupuncture group (FAG), filiform-needle acupuncture group (FFAG) and rehabilitation treatment group (RTG). During the 3-week treatment, the FAG will be treated every two days, while FFAG and RTG will be treated 5 d in a row and then rest for 2 d. The Simplified Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Scale and Modified Ashworth Scale will be used as the primary outcome measures. Statistical analysis will be conducted by an independent statistician. DISCUSSION: Through this study, the utility of fire-needle acupuncture in treating ULSP after stroke will be tested, and some specific claims of fire-needle acupuncture therapy will be evaluated, such as relieving spasm and muscular tension, improving activities of daily living, rapidity of response and less frequency of treatment compared with other treatments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (identifier: ChiCTR-IOR-17013875; registration date: 28 December 2016).

30847644|t|Lifestyles correlate with stroke recurrence in Chinese inpatients with first-ever acute ischemic stroke.
30847644|a|OBJECTIVES: The previous studies have shown that recurrent stroke (RS) adversely affects the life of survivors of ischemic stroke (IS). However, lifestyle associated with RS has received a little systematic study in Chinese Han patients. We aimed to perform a comprehensive assessment of lifestyle and the potential risk factors associated with RS in Chinese Han inpatients with first-ever acute ischemic stroke by conducting a long-term follow-up. METHODS: Using a prospective and longitudinal design, we recruited 421 patients with first-ever acute ischemic stroke who were consecutively admitted to the Acute Stroke Unit between November 2012 and January 2014. Demographic data, vascular risk factors, previous Rankin scale score, and etiology were collected at study intake. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to investigate the influencing factors for RS. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (13.5%) patients experienced RS during the 1-year follow-up period. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that smoking [hazard ratio (HR), 2.153; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.263-3.671], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (HR 0.438; 95% CI 0.211-0.911), housework (HR 0.488; 95% CI 0.256-0.933), ischemic heart disease (IHD) (HR 2.998; 95% CI 1.281-7.020), daily consumption of fresh fruits (HR 0.477; 95% CI 0.278-0.819), and good sleep quality (HR 0.375; 95% CI 0.216-0.650) were associated with RS among stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that healthy lifestyle (high fruit intake, smoking cessation, housework, and good sleep quality), higher HDL levels, and lack of IHD may be associated with a lower risk of RS in patients with first-onset IS.

30826129|t|Electroacupuncture for Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy after Stroke: A Meta-Analysis.
30826129|a|BACKGROUND: Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is the common complication among stroke and cerebral injury patients, which is lack of safe and effective treatment. Electroacupuncture (EA) may potentially be a reliably therapy, but the evidence is insufficiency. METHODS: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang Data, the Chinese Biology Medicine disc, etc., were searched, until July 20, 2018. We included random control trials that contrast EA with conventional rehabilitation therapy for the treatment of RSD. Main outcomes were visual analog scale score and Fugl-Meyer upper limb motor function scoring scale, other outcomes such as Barthel index, and hand swelling score were also collected. Data in included studies were extracted into an excel and pooled by Stata/MP 14.1. RESULTS: We incorporated 13 studies involving 1040 RSD patients and outcomes were from 2 to 6 weeks' follow-up. The analgesic effect between 2 groups had statistically significant difference (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -1.122, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-1.682 to -.562], P = .000], a statistical difference existed in improving dysfunction between 2 groups: (WMD = 6.039, 95% CI [2.231-.916], P = .000). EA groups had a better effect on improving activities of daily life abilities (WMD = 12.170, 95% CI [6.657-17.682], P < .00011] and better detumescence effect (WMD = -.800, 95% CI [-1.972 to -.212], P = .000] contrast to conventional rehabilitation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports that EA has a positive effect on alleviating pain, improving limb dysfunction, and promoting activities of daily living. On account of moderate-quality random control trials and high heterogeneity, further high-quality studies are imperative to optimize the EA treatment program.

30598351|t|Systematic review and meta-analysis of acute type B thoracic aortic dissection, open, or endovascular repair.
30598351|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare perioperative and mortality outcomes of endovascular aortic repair against open repair in acute type B thoracic aortic dissection. METHODS: A comprehensive search was undertaken among the four major databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Ovid) to identify all published data comparing open vs endovascular repair in management of acute type B aortic dissection. Databases where evaluated and assessed to July 2017. The 95% confidence intervals were analyzed from the extracted data using relevant statistical methods. RESULTS: Overall, 18,193 patients were found in a combination of nine studies. Patients undergoing open repair were younger (mean, 61.3 ± 9.3 years vs 66.6 ± 12.5 years; P < .00001). Postoperative stroke and paraplegia were similar in both groups (P = .71 and P = .81 respectively); however, the rate of all neurologic complications were more common in the traditional open repair group (6.9% vs 4.8%; P = .006). The all-cause operative and 1-year death was reported as higher in the open repair group (18.6% vs 7.4% [P < .0001] and 24.3% vs 14.3% [P < .0001], respectively); however, at 5 years this rate is almost similar between both groups (46.7% vs 49.7%; P = .21). At 1 year, the rate of reintervention was reported to be higher in endovascular repair group of patients (15.4% vs 5.5%; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: This study concludes that endovascular repair, in the setting of acute type B thoracic aortic dissection, provides an early surgical benefit; however, this finding has not yet been supported by long-term data. There seems to be a benefit with respect to all-neurologic events in favor of endovascular repair. Long-term comparative data and studies are required to give a better understanding of these two approaches.

31083203|t|Mitochondrial A3243G mutation causes mitochondrial encephalomyopathy in a Chinese patient: Case report.
31083203|a|RATIONALE: Mitochondrial mutations are associated with a wide spectrum of clinical abnormalities. More than half of these mutations are distributed in the 22 mitochondrial tRNA genes, including tRNA. In particular, the A3243G mutation in the tRNA gene causes mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 12-year-old boy was admitted to Shaoxing People's Hospital because there is a reduction in the volume of speech, dysphonia, unable to write, recognize words, and unable to wear clothes, accompanied by unstable walking after treatment of unexplained fever and somnolence. DIAGNOSES: The proband underwent a thorough examination in our hospital and was diagnosed as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. The proband carried the pathogenic heteroplasmic mutation A3243G mutation in mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. Although his parents did not carry the mutation. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and dexamethasone were used for the patient's antiviral, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory therapy, respectively. Intravenous mannitol was gradually tapered for reducing intracranial pressure with furosemide for inducing diuresis. Intravenous arginine could help to treat alkalosis and supple some essential amino acids. Oral oxiracetam capsules, vitamin B1, and coenzyme Q10 were used for providing nutrition and improving energy. His medications were 30 mg vitamin B1, 0.1 g vitamin C, and mecobalamin 750 μg daily after discharge from our hospital. OUTCOMES: The patient was able to walk and talk slowly with improved writing skills and no stroke-like episodes. The neurological examination was negative and muscle tension was identified as grade V. LESSONS: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy has different phenotypes, in addition to traditional examinations, it is important for clinicians to be familiar with genetic testing methodology as well as applications of these tests in clinic to get an accurate diagnosis.

31083192|t|Therapeutic effect of Fu's subcutaneous needling for hemiplegic shoulder pain among stroke survivors: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
31083192|a|BACKGROUND: Hemiplegic shoulder pain (HSP) is a frequent complication after stroke and limits patients' physical functioning of the affected arm, thus compromising their quality of life. Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) has been widely applied in the treatment of pain diseases in China; however, its efficacy and safety for HSP remain to be elucidated. We therefore conducted a randomized, controlled trial to summarize the current evidence on the effects of FSN on the recovery outcomes of stroke survivors with HSP. METHODS: Here, we conduct a study design and protocol of a randomized, blinded, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FSN in patients with HSP. A total of 60 patients with numerical rating scale (NRS) score above 1 will be recruited in the trial and randomized into FSN group or usual care (UC) group. Patients in the FSN group will receive FSN treatment combined with UC treatment while patients in the UC group will receive UC treatment alone for 4 weeks. The primary outcomes are changes of NRS at baseline, after the 1st treatment, after the final treatment and 4 weeks after the final treatment. Secondary measurements will be changes of Fugl-Meyer score, constant score, MPQ-SF score, quality of life score, and range of motion at baseline, after the final treatment, and 4 weeks after the final treatment. The safety will also be assessed by monitoring the incidence of adverse events and changes in vital signs during the study. DISCUSSION: Results from this trial will significantly support the application of FSN in the recovery of patients with HSP. If found to be effective and safe, FSN will be a valuable complementary option for patients with HSP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR1900021644 (registered on March 2, 2019).

31045796|t|Carotid plaque magnetic resonance imaging and recurrent stroke risk: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.
31045796|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Carotid atherosclerotic plaque is an important cause of carotid artery stenosis. The features of carotid atherosclerotic plaque detected by relevant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), such as lipid core, plaque hemorrhage, and fibrous cap rupture, have been confirmed to be associated with the occurrence of the first cerebral ischemic event. Meanwhile, the features of carotid atherosclerotic plaque can be used as biomarkers to predict the occurrence of cerebral ischemic event. However, the mechanism of recurrent stroke is still unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis will be performed to summarize the association between features of carotid artery plaque detected by MRI and recurrent stroke, so as to find biomarkers that can predict recurrent stroke. METHODS: Electronic search will be performed in PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to October 30, 2018. We will include cohort studies with an average follow-up time of >1 month in which lipid-rich/necrotic cores (LRNC), intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), and thinned or ruptured fibrous caps (TRFC) are associated with recurrent ipsilateral stroke or ischemic events. We will perform heterogeneity assessment before carrying out meta-analysis. According to the heterogeneity, we select random effect model or fixed effect model for meta-analysis of the included cohort studies. RESULTS: Review Manager 5.3 software will be used to calculate the combined hazard ratio value and 95% confidence interval (CI). This meta-analysis will provide high-quality data analysis of LRNC, IPH, and TRFC and ipsilateral recurrent stroke or ischemic events, including biomarkers as major predictors. CONCLUSION: The systematic review will provide evidence to assess the association between features of carotid plaque and ipsilateral recurrent stroke or ischemic events.

30611747|t|Mesenchymal stem cells transfer mitochondria into cerebral microvasculature and promote recovery from ischemic stroke.
30611747|a|Mesenchymal stem cells can be used as a novel treatment of ischemic stroke, but their therapeutic effect and mechanism of action require further evaluation. Mitochondrial dysfunction has core functions in ischemia-reperfusion stroke injury. Our recent research has demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells can transfer their functional mitochondria to injured endothelial cells via tunneling nanotubes in vitro, resulting in the rescue of aerobic respiration and protection of endothelial cells from apoptosis. Therefore, we presume that the mechanisms of mitochondrial protection may be involved in stem cell-mediated rescue of injured cerebral microvasculature and recovery from ischemic stroke. In this study, the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion surgery were conducted on rats, and mesenchymal stem cells were then engrafted into the injured cerebrovascular system. Our results showed that the host cells of injured cerebral microvasculature accepted the mitochondria transferred from the transplanted stem cells, thereby resulting in significantly improving in mitochondrial activity of injured microvasculature, enhancing angiogenesis, reducing infarct volume, and improving functional recovery. Our data provided the evidence that stem cells can rescue damaged cerebrovascular system in stroke through a mechanism not yet identified.

30688264|t|Shuxuetong injection protects cerebral microvascular endothelial cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation reperfusion.
30688264|a|Shuxuetong injection composed of leech (Hirudo nipponica Whitman) and earthworm (Pheretima aspergillum) has been used for the clinical treatment of acute stroke for many years in China. However, the precise neuroprotective mechanism of Shuxuetong injection remains poorly understood. Here, cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were incubated in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 95% N2/5% CO2 for 6 hours, followed by high-glucose medium containing 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for 18 hours to establish an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion model. This in vitro cell model was administered Shuxuetong injection at 1/32, 1/64, and 1/128 concentrations (diluted 32-, 64-, and 128-times). Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate cell viability. A fluorescence method was used to measure lactate dehydrogenase, and a fluorescence microplate reader used to detect intracellular reactive oxygen species. A fluorescent probe was also used to measure mitochondrial superoxide production. A cell resistance meter was used to measure transepithelial resistance and examine integrity of monolayer cells. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran test was performed to examine blood-brain barrier permeability. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Western blot assay was performed to analyze expression of caspase-3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, occludin, vascular endothelial growth factor, cleaved caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, nuclear factor-κB p65, I kappa B alpha, phosphorylated I kappa B alpha, I kappa B kinase, phosphorylated I kappa B kinase, claudin-5, and zonula occludens-1. Our results show that Shuxuetong injection increases bEnd.3 cell viability and B-cell lymphoma 2 expression, reduces cleaved caspase-3 expression, inhibits production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide, suppresses expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, markedly increases transepithelial resistance, decreases blood-brain barrier permeability, upregulates claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 expression, reduces nuclear factor-κB p65 and vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and reduces I kappa B alpha, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, and I kappa B kinase phosphorylation levels. Overall, these findings suggest that Shuxuetong injection has protective effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion. Moreover, its protective effect is associated with reduction of mitochondrial superoxide production, inhibition of the inflammatory response, and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, and the nuclear factor-κB p65 signaling pathway.

30688263|t|Early constraint-induced movement therapy affects behavior and neuronal plasticity in ischemia-injured rat brains.
30688263|a|Constraint-induced movement therapy is an effective rehabilitative training technique used to improve the restoration of impaired upper extremity movement after stroke. However, whether constraint-induced movement therapy is more effective than conventional rehabilitation in acute or sub-acute stroke remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to identify the optimal time to start constraint-induced movement therapy after ischemic stroke and to explore the mechanisms by which constraint-induced movement therapy leads to post-stroke recovery. Sixty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham-surgery group, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion group, early constraint-induced movement therapy group, and late constraint-induced movement therapy group. Rat models of left middle cerebral artery occlusion were established according to the Zea Longa line embolism method. Constraint-induced movement therapy was conducted starting on day 1 or day 14 in the early constraint-induced movement therapy and late constraint-induced movement therapy groups, respectively. To explore the effect of each intervention time on neuromotor function, behavioral function was assessed using a balance beam walking test before surgery and at 8 and 21 days after surgery. The expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor and Nogo receptor were evaluated using real time-polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay to assess the effect of each intervention time. The results showed that the behavioral score was significantly lower in the early constraint-induced movement therapy group than in the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and late constraint-induced movement therapy groups at 8 days. At 21 days, the scores had significantly decreased in the early constraint-induced movement therapy and late constraint-induced movement therapy groups. At 8 days, only mild pyknosis appeared in neurons of the ischemic penumbra in the early constraint-induced movement therapy group, which was distinctly better than in the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion group. At 21 days, only a few vacuolated cells were observed and no obvious inflammatory cells were visible in late constraint-induced movement therapy group, which was much better than at 8 days. The mRNA and protein expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor were significantly higher, but expression levels of Nogo receptor were significantly lower in the early constraint-induced movement therapy group compared with the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and late constraint-induced movement therapy groups at 8 days. The changes in expression levels at 21 days were larger but similar in both the early constraint-induced movement therapy and late constraint-induced movement therapy groups. Besides, the protein nerve growth factor level was higher in the late constraint-induced movement therapy group than in the early constraint-induced movement therapy group at 21 days. These results suggest that both early (1 day) and late (14 days) constraint-induced movement therapy induces molecular plasticity and facilitates functional recovery after ischemic stroke, as illustrated by the histology. The mechanism may be associated with downregulation of Nogo receptor expression and upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor expression.

30759063|t|Antidepressant-like effects of paeoniflorin on post-stroke depression in a rat model.
30759063|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is one of the most prevalent emotional disorders after stroke and often results in poor outcomes. However, the underlying physiopathologic mechanism and effective treatment of PSD remain poorly elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether paeoniflorin has antidepressant-like activity in a rat model of PSD. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham-operated control (Sham), PSD, paeoniflorin (with PSD) and fluoxetine group(with PSD). PSD was developed by the right middle cerebral artery occlusion followed 21 days chronic unpredictable mild stress combined (CUMS) with raised alone. Tests of sucrose preference and open field were used to assess the depression-like behavior. Neurological function was evaluated by neurological deficit score and beam balance test. Expression of phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the CA1 region of the hippocampal complex was evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Te depressive-like behaviors markedly improved after paeoniflorin and fluoxetine treatment. Furthermore, paeoniflorin treatment significantly increased BDNF and p-CREB expression in the CA1 region. CONCLUSIONS: Observed results suggested that paeoniflorin could ameliorate the symptoms and improve the functional capability of PSD rats, similar to the effect of fluoxetine. ABBREVIATIONS: PSD: post-stroke depression; CUMS: chronic unpredictable mild stress stimulation; MCAO: middle cerebral artery occlusion; OFT: open field test; SPT: sucrose preference test, NDS: neurological deficit score, BBT: beam balance test; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein; p-CREB: phosphorylated Cyclic-AMP responsive element binding protein.

31001680|t|Acupuncture is effective in improving functional communication in post-stroke aphasia : A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
31001680|a|OBJECTIVE: In this meta-analysis the authors evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in improving functional communication and language function in post-stroke aphasia (PSA) patients. METHODS: Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, AMED, SinoMed, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang databases, ICTRP, ISRCTN, EUCTR, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Stroke Trials Registries. A search was carried out for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of acupuncture compared with no treatment or placebo acupuncture on post-stroke aphasia (PSA). The searched records were independently screened by two authors, who extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias of the included RCTs. Data aggregation and risk of bias evaluation were conducted on Review Manager Version 5.3. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42016037543). RESULTS: A total of 28 RCTs involving 1747 patients (883 patients in the treatment group and 864 patients in the control group) were included in the quantitative synthesis. The results demonstrated significant effects of acupuncture in improving PSA functional communication (P < 0.00001, standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.01 [0.81, 1.20]), severity of impairment (P < 0.0001, SMD = 0.64 [0.45, 0.84]), spontaneous speech (P = 0.0002, SMD = 1.51 [0.71, 2.32]), auditory comprehension (P < 0.0001, SMD = 0.84 [0.43, 1.26]), repetition (P < 0.00001, SMD = 1.13 [0.75, 1.52]), naming (P = 0.03, SMD = 0.65 [0.08, 1.23]), reading (P < 0.0001, SMD = 1.56 [0.83, 2.29]), and writing (P = 0.009, SMD = 1.03 [0.25, 1.80]). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture seems to be effective in improving PSA functional communication and language function.

In this research,908 chemical compounds of Xixian Tongshuan Capsules were collected,and 337 potential targets were discovered by pharmacophore based reverse target identification. Protein interaction network( PIN)was then constructed and Identifying Protein Complex Algorithm( IPCA) was used to obtain the modules of the capsule and analyze the potential action mechanism. According to the research,Xixian Tongshuan Capsules could play a therapeutic role for hyperlipidemia and hypertension by regulating lipid metabolic process and blood pressure,the most direct risk factors of apoplexy. It could be used to treat the cerebral thrombosis and irreversible death of nerve tissue caused by insufficient supply of cerebral tissue blood and oxygen,in a way of regulating blood circulation system and nervous system. Xixian Tongshuan Capsules could also treat stroke-induced inflammation and inflammatory immune response through its regulatory effect on inflammatory immune response. Based on the network analysis,the antiinflammatory activity of Xixian Tongshuan Capsules extracts was investigated by measuring the NO release with Griess reagent method through LPS-induced in vitro inflammation model of RAW264. 7 cells. The results showed that Xixian Tongshuan Capsules extracts inhibited the secretion of NO by LPS-induced RAW264. 7 cells,indicating favorable anti-inflammatory activity. This research illuminates the mechanism of Xixian Tongshuan Capsules based on the PIN analysis at molecular network level,providing a scientific basis for its clinical application.

31183363|t|Bioinformatics Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles of Sex Differences in Ischemic Stroke.
31183363|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) is a complex disease with sex differences in epidemiology, presentations, and outcomes. However, the sex-specific mechanism underlying IS remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify key genes contributing to biological differences between sexes. First, we downloaded the gene expression data of GSE22255 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software and related packages. Second, DEGs were separately analyzed by Gene Ontology enrichment and pathways analyses. Third, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to further investigate the interactions of DEGs. A total of 123 DEGs were identified between sexes, including 8 upregulated and 115 downregulated genes. In the PPI network, ten key genes were identified, including IL1α, IL1β, IL6, IL8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL20, CCL4, ICAM1, and PTGS2. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in biological processes of immune response and apoptotic process, also in pathways of TNF and NOD-like receptor signaling. In conclusion, the above ten genes may have a protective effect on IS females through their direct or indirect involvement in biological processes of immune response and apoptotic process, as well as in TNF and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. The results of this study may help to gain new insights into the sex-specific mechanisms underlying IS females and may suggest potential therapeutic targets for disease treatment.

30753912|t|Fastigial nucleus electrostimulation promotes axonal regeneration after experimental stroke via cAMP/PKA pathway.
30753912|a|Axon regeneration after cerebral ischemia in mammals is inadequate to restore function, illustrating the need to design better strategies for improving outcomes. Improvement of axon regeneration has been achieved through fastigial nucleus electrostimulation (FNS) in animal researches. However, the mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection remain poorly understood. Increasing the levels of the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) enhances axon regeneration, making it an excellent candidate molecule that has therapeutic potential. In the present study, we examined the expression of cAMP signaling in ischemic brain tissues following focal cerebral ischemia. Adult rats were subjected to ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). A dipolar electrode was placed into the cerebellum to stimulate the cerebellar fastigial nucleus for 1 h after ischemia. Neurological deficits and the expressions of cAMP, PKA (protein kinase A) and ROCK (Rho-kinase) were determined. Axonal regeneration was measured by upregulation of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43). The data indicated that FNS significantly enhanced axonal regeneration and motor function recovery after cerebral ischemia. FNS also significantly increased cAMP and PKA levels after ischemic brain injury. All the beneficial effects of FNS were blocked by Rp-cAMP, an antagonist of PKA. Our research suggested that the axonal regeneration conferred by FNS was likely achieved via the regulation of cAMP/PKA pathway.

30708047|t|Astragaloside IV Protects Primary Cerebral Cortical Neurons from Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation by Activating the PKA/CREB Pathway.
30708047|a|Stroke is one of the major leading causes of death and disability worldwide, and post-stroke cognitive impairment is a major contributor to this disability. Astragaloside IV (AST-IV) is a primary bioactive compound of Radix Astragali, which is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stroke. AST-IV was found to possess cognition-enhancing properties against ischemic stroke; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely elusive. Mitochondrial health is critical to cell viability after ischemic injury. Cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor that can be activated by protein kinase A (PKA) to preserve mitochondria, regulate memory and cognitive functions. We used an in vitro model of ischemic injury via oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) of cultured neurons, which led to PKA inactivation and decreased CREB phosphorylation, reduced cell viability, and increased neuronal apoptosis. We hypothesized that AST-IV could protect OGD-exposed cerebral cortical neurons by modulating the PKA/CREB signaling pathway and preserving mitochondrial function. We found that the mitochondrial and cellular injuries induced by OGD were reversed following treatment with AST-IV. The activity of neuronal mitochondria was evaluated by measuring the mitochondrial potential and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). AST-IV significantly enhanced PKA and CREB phosphorylation and prevented OGD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby protecting neurons exposed to OGD from injury and death. Furthermore, the effects of AST-IV were partially blocked by a PKA inhibitor. Collectively, these data elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of AST-IV against ischemic injury in cortical neurons.

31031621|t|1H NMR-Based Metabolomics Reveals Refined-Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (BBG) as a Potential Ischemic Stroke Treatment Drug With Efficacy and a Favorable Therapeutic Window.
31031621|a|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to treat ischemic stroke. However, the complexity of its chemical composition makes quality control difficult. Berberine, baicalin, and geniposide are the three main ingredients in HLJDD. Here, a formula of BBG comprised of berberine, baicalin, and geniposide, known as Refined-Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction, was investigated for its efficacy, therapeutic window, and mechanisms of action. BBG was assessed on two major types of ischemic stroke, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and continuous ischemia injury, respectively. BBG showed efficacy comparable to HLJDD in the treatment of cerebral I/R injury within 5 h after injury initiation but did poorly in treating continuous ischemia injury. BBG exhibited neuroprotective effects on cerebral I/R injury by regaining the balance in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism, inflammation, and nucleic acid metabolism. These results suggested that BBG could be a good alternative to HLJDD, with high efficacy and a long therapeutic window, which shows great potential for drug development to treat stroke.

31093303|t|Timing of Acupuncture during LTP-Like Plasticity Induced by Paired-Associative Stimulation.
31093303|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the time-dependent effects of acupuncture on the excitability and long-term potentiation- (LTP-) like plasticity induced by paired-associative stimulation (PAS) over the primary motor cortex (M1). The present examination is the first to report the influence of acupuncture on the motor-evoked potential (MEP) throughout the treatment process, including baseline (before acupuncture), the needle in situ, and the needle removal. Subsequently, the LTP-like plasticity induced by paired-associative stimulation (PAS) was explored, which consisted of 200 pairs of electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the first dorsal interosseous (FDI), followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the bilateral M1. TMS-MEP amplitudes over the bilateral M1 in resting conditions were measured throughout the whole treatment process. Finally, we confirmed the behavioral measurements. Significant changes were found in both the contralateral and ipsilateral acupuncture sizes as compared to the baseline values. Our results indicated that acupuncture modulated the excitability of M1, and the synaptic plasticity was time-dependent. We concluded that acupuncture should be combined with rehabilitation techniques to improve the motor function in stroke patients. Therefore, we put forward the combined application of the acupuncture timing and rehabilitation for higher therapeutic effectiveness. This trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration no. ChiCTR-IPR-1900020515).

30987181|t|IMM-H004 Protects against Cerebral Ischemia Injury and Cardiopulmonary Complications via CKLF1 Mediated Inflammation Pathway in Adult and Aged Rats.
30987181|a|(1) Background: Chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) is a chemokine with potential to be a target for stroke therapy. Compound IMM-H004 is a novel coumarin derivative screened from a CKLF1/C-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) system and has been reported to improve cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of IMM-H004 on cerebral ischemia injury and its infectious cardiopulmonary complications in adult and aged rats from the CKLF1 perspective. (2) Methods: The effects of IMM-H004 on the protection was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, behavior tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Nissl staining, histo-pathological examination, and cardiopulmonary function detection. Immunohistological staining, immunofluorescence staining, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and western blotting were used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. (3) Results: IMM-H004 protects against cerebral ischemia induced brain injury and its cardiopulmonary complications, inhibiting injury, and inflammation through CKLF1-dependent anti-inflammation pathway in adult and aged rats. IMM-H004 downregulates the amount of CKLF1, suppressing the followed inflammatory response, and further protects the damaged organs from ischemic injury. (4) Conclusions: The present study suggested that the protective mechanism of IMM-H004 is dependent on CKLF1, which will lead to excessive inflammatory response in cerebral ischemia. IMM-H004 could also be a therapeutic agent in therapy for ischemic stroke and cardiopulmonary complications in the aged population.

30597588|t|Identification of the absorbed components and their metabolites of Tianma-Gouteng granule in rat plasma and bile using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
30597588|a|Tianma-Gouteng granule (TGG), a Chinese herbal formula preparation, is clinically used for the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases such as hypertension, cerebral ischaemia, acute ischaemic stroke and Parkinson's disease. Although few reports have been published concerning the absorbed prototype components of TGG, the possible metabolic pathways of TGG in vivo remain largely unclear. In this study, a method using UPLC-Q/TOF MS was established for the detection and identification of the absorbed prototype components and related metabolites in rat plasma and bile after oral administration of TGG at high and normal clinical dosages. A total of 68 components were identified or tentatively identified in plasma and bile samples, including absorbed prototypes and their metabolites. The major absorbed components were gastrodin, isorhynchophylline, rhynchophylline, isocorynoxeine, corynoxeine, geissoschizine methyl ether baicalin, baicalein, wogonoside, wogonin, geniposidic acid, leonurine, 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-d-glucoside and emodin. The main metabolic pathways of these components involved phase I (isomerization, hydrolysis and reduction) and phase II (glucuronidation and sulfation) reaction, and the phase II biotransformation pathway was predominant. The present study provides rich information on the in vivo absorption and metabolism of TGG, and the results will be helpful for further studies on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TGG.

30697923|t|Effects of thrombolysis within 6 hours on acute cerebral infarction in an improved rat embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion model for ischaemic stroke.
30697923|a|Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the first-line drug for revascularization in acute cerebral infarction (ACI) treatment. In this study, an improved rat embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion model for ischaemic stroke was used and the rats were killed on the first, third and seventh day after model establishment. Increases in infarct volume were significantly less in the thrombolytic group than in the conventional group at every time-point. The microvascular density (MVD) in the thrombolytic group was significantly higher than that in the conventional group at every time-point, especially on the seventh day. Increases in the expressions of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) and caspase-3 in the ischaemic region and in the nitric oxide contents, malondialdehyde contents, and inducible NOS activities in the cortex of infarct side were significantly less in the thrombolytic group than in the conventional group. Furthermore, decreases in the superoxide dismutase activities in the thrombolytic group were significantly less than those in the conventional group. In conclusion, thrombolytic rt-PA therapy within a broadened therapeutic window (6 hours) could significantly decrease the infarct volume after ACI, possibly by increasing MVD in the ischaemic region, decreasing apoptotic molecule expression, and alleviating the oxidative stress response.

30816517|t|Neuroprotection of hydroxysafflor yellow A in experimental cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via metabolic inhibition of phenylalanine and mitochondrial biogenesis.
30816517|a|Stroke is the second most frequent cause of mortality, resulting in a huge societal burden worldwide. Timely reperfusion is the most effective therapy; however, it is difficult to prevent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In traditional Chinese medicine, hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) has been widely used for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease and as a protective therapy against I/R injury. Evidence has demonstrated that HSYA could reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species and suppress cellular apoptosis; however, whether HSYA alters the metabolic profile as its underlying mechanism for neuroprotection remains unknown. In the present study, using a metabolomic screening, phenylalanine was identified to significantly increase in an experimental model of mouse cerebral I/R injury. Notably, western blotting and qPCR analysis were conducted to test the expression level of apoptosis‑associated factors, and HSYA was identified to be able to protect neuronal cells by reducing phenylalanine level associated with I/R injury. Additionally, these findings were confirmed in primary mouse neurons and PC12 cells exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) stress. Of note, HSYA was observed to regulate the mRNA expression of key metabolic enzymes, phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, which are responsible for phenylalanine metabolism. Furthermore, by performing mitochondrial labeling and JC‑1 fluorescence assay, HSYA was identified to promote mitochondrial function and biogenesis suppressed by OGD/R. The findings of the present study demonstrated that I/R injury could increase the levels of phenylalanine, and HSYA may inhibit phenylalanine synthesis to enhance mitochondrial function and biogenesis for neuroprotection. The present study proposed a novel metabolite biomarker for cerebral I/R injury and the evaluated the efficacy of HSYA as a potential therapeutic treatment I/R injury.

30088176|t|Astragaloside VI Promotes Neural Stem Cell Proliferation and Enhances Neurological Function Recovery in Transient Cerebral Ischemic Injury via Activating EGFR/MAPK Signaling Cascades.
30088176|a|Radix Astragali (AR) is a commonly used medicinal herb for post-stroke disability in Traditional Chinese Medicine but its active compounds for promoting neurogenic effects are largely unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that Astragaloside VI could be a promising active compound from AR for adult neurogenesis and brain repair via targeting epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated MAPK signaling pathway in post-stroke treatment. By using cultured neural stem cells (NSCs) and experimental stroke rat model, we investigated the effects of Astragaloside VI on inducing NSCs proliferation and self-renewal in vitro, and enhancing neurogenesis for the recovery of the neurological functions in post-ischemic brains in vivo. For animal experiments, rats were undergone 1.5 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) plus 7 days reperfusion. Astragaloside VI (2 μg/kg) was daily administrated by intravenous injection (i.v.) for 7 days. Astragaloside VI treatment promoted neurogenesis and astrogenic formation in dentate gyrus zone, subventricular zone, and cortex of the transient ischemic rat brains in vivo. Astragaloside VI treatment enhanced NSCs self-renewal and proliferation in the cultured NSCs in vitro without affecting NSCs differentiation. Western blot analysis showed that Astragaloside VI up-regulated the expression of nestin, p-EGFR and p-MAPK, and increased neurosphere sizes, whose effects were abolished by the co-treatment of EGF receptor inhibitor gefitinib and ERK inhibitor PD98059. Behavior tests revealed that Astragaloside VI promoted the spatial learning and memory and improved the impaired motor function in transient cerebral ischemic rats. Taken together, Astragaloside VI could effectively activate EGFR/MAPK signaling cascades, promote NSCs proliferation and neurogenesis in transient cerebral ischemic brains, and improve the repair of neurological functions in post-ischemic stroke rats. Astragaloside VI could be a new therapeutic drug candidate for post-stroke treatment.

31143652|t|Preliminary application of CT perfusion source images for evaluating regional collateral circulation in unilateral Moyamoya disease.
31143652|a|Background: Collateral flow is associated with clinical outcomes for patients with Moyamoya disease and served as a parameter for patient selection of therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we explored whether a noninvasive imaging modality, computed tomography perfusion (CTP) source images (CTP-Sis), could be used to identify the presence and intensity of collateral flow using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as a gold standard for collateral flow. Methods: CTP-Sis and DSA were performed for 24 patients with unilateral Moyamoya disease. A collateral grading system was developed based on arterial and venous phase CTP-Sis, imitating the DSA score system. Two neuroradiologists scored the DSA images using a collateral grading scale for the regions of interest corresponding to the Alberta Stroke Program Early computed tomography Score (ASPECTS) methodology. Another two neuroradiologists scored CTP-Sis in a similar manner. Agreement between the CTP-Sis and DSA consensus scores was determined, including kappa statistics. Results: The agreement between the CTP-Sis and DSA consensus readings was moderate to strong, with a weighted kappa value of 0.768 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.703-0.832], but there was a better agreement for readers of CTP-Sis, as compared with those of DSA. The sensitivity and specificity for identifying collaterals with CTP-Sis were 0.714 (95% CI, 0.578-0.851) and 0.995 (95% CI, 0.985-1.000), respectively. Conclusions: CTP-Sis could help identify in a noninvasive manner the presence and intensity of collateral flow in patients with unilateral Moyamoya disease using DSA as a gold standard. Further study with a large number of cases is warranted. Further application of this method to other cerebrovascular diseases including acute ischemic stroke can also be warranted.

31090337|t|[Effect of modified Buyang Huanwu Decoction on hemorrhagic transformation after rt-PA intravenous thrombolysis in patients with super early cerebral infarction].
31090337|a|To study the effect of modified Buyang Huanwu Decoction on the hemorrhagic transformation after intravenous thrombolysis of recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator(rt-PA) in patients with super early(onset time<4. 5 h) cerebral infarction. From March 2016 to July 2018,at the brain disease zone of the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,212 cases of super early cerebral infarction were selected and divided into two group according to the randomized complete blocks designs: control group(106 cases) and traditional Chinese medicine group(106 cases). The control group was treated with rt-PA intravenous thrombolysis,while the traditional Chinese medicine group was treated with modified Buyang Huanwu Decoction in addition to the therapy of the control group. Both groups were treated for 14 days. Neurological deficit score,serum matrix metalloproteinase-9(MMP-9),neuron specific enolase(NSE),vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and plasma cellular fibronectin(c-FN) levels,the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation,clinical efficacy and adverse drug reactions before and after treatment were compared between the two groups. According to the findings,at the 14 thday after treatment,the rank sum test of the grade data showed that the clinical efficacy of the traditional Chinese medicine group was better than that of the control group(Z =-2. 033,P = 0. 042); on the basis of χ2 test,the total efficiency of the traditional Chinese medicine group was higher than that of the control group(χ2= 4. 895,P =0. 027); the hemorrhagic transformation rate of the traditional Chinese medicine group was lower than that of the control group within14 days of treatment(χ2= 3. 962,P = 0. 047). MMP-9 levels in the traditional Chinese medicine group were lower than those in the control group at the 3 rd,5 th,7 th,10 th,14 thd after treatment(t =-2. 474,-3. 022,-5. 163,-6. 998,-9. 821; P = 0. 014,0. 003,0,0,0). The improvement of c-FN,NSE,VEGF and NIHSS scores in the traditional Chinese medicine group was superior to that of the control group after 14 days of treatment(t =-2. 343,-3. 187,-2. 129,-3. 105; P = 0. 020,0. 002,0. 034,0. 002). No obvious adverse reactions of modified Buyang Huanwu Decoction were observed during 14 days of treatment. Modified Buyang Huanwu Decoction could reduce the expressions of MMP-9,c-FN,NSE and VEGF after rt-PA intravenous thrombolysis in patients with super early cerebral infarction,and decrease the hemorrhagic transformation rate after thrombolysis,with high safety.

31090302|t|[Lipid regulation mechanism and dosage form selection of Xixian Tongshuan Preparation based on molecular simulation methods].
31090302|a|Atherosclerosis is the main cause of stroke, and dyslipidemia is the most important risk factor for atherosclerosis. In this paper, pharmacophore and molecular docking models of eight key lipid-lowering targets, namely NPC1 L1, HMG-CoA reductase, SQS, MTP, CETP, PPARα, LXRα and LXRβ, were used to screen out the small molecular database of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), which was made up of ingredients of thirteen Chinese herbal medicines contained in Xixian Tongshuan Preparation. The screening results indicated that the preparation could showed an effect in regulating lipid on target NPC1 L1, HMG-CoA reductase, LXRβ and SQS through four groups of potential active compounds, namely prupersin A in peach kernel and suffruticoside A in gastrodiaelata, limocitrin-β-D-glucoside in Ligusticum chuanxiong, 2'-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-sweroside in Pinellia ternate and quercitrin in Panax notoginseng, 4-tert-butyl-2-[(5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-phenyl)methoxy-methyl]-6-(hydroxymethyl)p henol in Gastrodia elata. Moreover, the properties and extraction process of the most potentialactive compounds were consistent with the preparation process of Xixian Tongshuan Capsules, which indicated that the capsule had more advantages than the pill in the existing two dosage forms of Xixian Tongshuan Preparation. This study analyzed the pharmacodynamic basis and mechanism of Xixian Tongshuan Capsules in regulating lipid for treating stroke, and provided evidence for its further research and clinical application.

30916171|t|CBS promoter hypermethylation increases the risk of hypertension and stroke.
30916171|a|OBJECTIVES: Cystathionine β-synthase is a major enzyme in the metabolism of plasma homocysteine. Hyperhomocysteinemia is positively associated with hypertension and stroke. The present study was performed to examine the possible effects of Cystathionine β-synthase promoter methylation on the development of hypertension and stroke. METHODS: Using quantitative methylation-specific PCR, we determined the Cystathionine β-synthase methylation levels in 218 healthy individuals and 132 and 243 age- and gender-matched stroke and hypertensive patients, respectively. The relative changes in Cystathionine β-synthase promoter methylation were analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCt method. The percent of the methylated reference of Cystathionine β-synthase was used to represent the Cystathionine β-synthase promoter methylation levels. RESULTS: In this study, the Cystathionine β-synthase promoter methylation levels of hypertensive and stroke participants were both higher than that of the healthy individuals (median percentages of the methylated reference were 50.61%, 38.05% and 30.53%, respectively, all p<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that Cystathionine β-synthase promoter hypermethylation increased the risk of hypertension [odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, CI)=1.035 (1.025-1.045)] and stroke [OR (95% CI)=1.015 (1.003-1.028)]. The area under the curve of Cystathionine β-synthase promoter methylation was 0.844 (95% CI: 0.796-0.892) in male patients with hypertension and 0.722 (95% CI: 0.653-0.799) in male patients with stroke. CONCLUSION: Cystathionine β-synthase promoter hypermethylation increases the risk of hypertension and stroke, especially in male patients.

30898173|t|Effect of electro-acupuncture on lateralization of the human swallowing motor cortex excitability in healthy subjects: study protocol for a single-blind, randomized controlled trial.
30898173|a|BACKGROUND: Numerous randomized controlled trials on the effects of electro-acupuncture have been conducted to treat dysphagia as a sequela of stroke. However, the normal physiological mechanisms of swallowing and the pathological mechanisms of dysphagia are not fully understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lateralization of the human swallowing motor cortex excitability in healthy subjects will be influenced by electro-acupuncture to Lianquan (CV 23) and Fengfu (GV 16), which may provide insight into the pathological mechanisms of dysphagia after stroke. METHODS: We designed a single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial in which 40 healthy subjects will be recruited. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 into two groups: the electro-acupuncture group and the sham-control electro-acupuncture group. The swallowing motor cortex will be located in both groups using a neuroimaging navigation system. Then left and right cortical stimulation will be measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after electro-acupuncture or sham electro-acupuncture. The electro-acupuncture or sham electro-acupuncture interventions will last for 15 min. The primary outcome measure will be percent change in the resting motor threshold (RMT) of the mylohyoid. The secondary outcome measures will be the amplitude (μV) and latency (ms) of the motor evoked potential (MEP) of the mylohyoid as a proxy for the TMS evoked potential. All outcomes will be measured at baseline and after the electro-acupuncture or sham electro-acupuncture treatment. DISCUSSION: The aim of this trial is to explore whether lateralization of the human swallowing motor cortex excitability in healthy subjects is present, and to determine if electro-acupuncture to acupuncture points Lianquan (CV 23) and Fengfu (GV 16) will exert an effect on it under normal physiological conditions.

31020002|t|Effect of Tui Na on upper limb spasticity after stroke: a randomized clinical trial.
31020002|a|Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of Tui Na for treating spasticity of the upper limbs of stroke patients. Design: A prospective, multicenter, blinded, randomized controlled intervention study. Subjects: Stroke patients with upper limb spasticity who were treated between December 2013 and February 2017 in 16 participating institutions in China were randomly assigned to receive either Tui Na plus conventional rehabilitation (Tui Na group, n = 222,) or conventional rehabilitation only (control group, n = 222). Methods: Eligible adult patients (aged 18-75 years) were enrolled 1-12 months after stroke and randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the two groups. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Muscle tone in the spastic muscles was evaluated using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and the primary endpoint was the change in MAS score over 4 weeks of treatment. Results: Among patients who had experienced stroke 1-3 months before treatment, the Tui Na group experienced significantly greater reductions in MAS scores for three muscle groups than did the control group after 4 weeks of treatment. These improvements were sustained at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. However, among patients who suffered from stroke 4-6 months and 7-12 months before treatment, the change in MAS with treatment did not differ significantly between those who did and those who did not receive Tui Na. No Tui Na-related adverse events during treatment were reported the groups. Conclusion: Tui Na was effective and safe for alleviating poststroke spasticity within 1-3 months after stroke onset.

30914909|t|Somatosensory Stimulation With XNKQ Acupuncture Modulates Functional Connectivity of Motor Areas.
30914909|a|Xingnao Kaiqiao (XNKQ) acupuncture is an acupuncture technique used for stroke patients. In 24 healthy volunteers, we applied this complex acupuncture intervention, which consists of a manual needle-stimulation on five acupuncture points (DU26 unilaterally, PC6, and SP6 bilaterally). XNKQ was compared to three control conditions: (1) insertion of needles on the XNKQ acupuncture points without stimulation, (2) manual needle-stimulation on five nearby non-acupuncture points, and (3) insertion of needles on the non-acupuncture points without stimulation. In a within-subject design, we investigated functional connectivity changes in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by means of the data-driven eigenvector centrality (EC) approach. With a 2 × 2 factorial within-subjects design with two-factor stimulation (stimulation vs. non-stimulation) and location (acupuncture points vs. non-acupuncture points), we found decreased EC in the precuneus after needle-stimulation (stimulation<non-stimulation), whereas the factor location showed no statistically significant EC differences. XNKQ acupuncture compared with needle-stimulation on non-acupuncture points showed decreased EC primarily in subcortical structures such as the caudate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, and red nucleus. Post-hoc seed-based analysis revealed that the decrease in EC was mainly driven by reduced temporal correlation to primary sensorimotor cortices. The comparison of XNKQ acupuncture with the other two (non-stimulation) interventions showed no significant differences in EC. Our findings support the importance of the stimulation component of the acupuncture intervention and hint toward the modulation of functional connectivity by XNKQ acupuncture, especially in areas involved in motor function. As a next step, similar mechanisms should be validated in stroke patients suffering from motor deficits. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02453906.

30930774|t|Anti-inflammatory Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicines on Preclinical in vivo Models of Brain Ischemia-Reperfusion-Injury: Prospects for Neuroprotective Drug Discovery and Therapy.
30930774|a|Acquired brain ischemia-and reperfusion-injury (IRI), including both Ischemic stroke (IS) and Traumatic Brain injury (TBI), is one of the most common causes of disability and death in adults and represents a major burden in both western and developing countries worldwide. China's clinical neurological therapeutic experience in the use of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), including TCM-derived active compounds, Chinese herbs, TCM formulations and decoction, in brain IRI diseases indicated a trend of significant improvement in patients' neurological deficits, calling for blind, placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trials with careful meta-analysis evaluation. There are many TCMs in use for brain IRI therapy in China with significant therapeutic effects in preclinical studies using different brain IRI-animal. The basic hypothesis in this field claims that in order to avoid the toxicity and side effects of the complex TCM formulas, individual isolated and identified compounds that exhibited neuroprotective properties could be used as lead compounds for the development of novel drugs. China's efforts in promoting TCMs have contributed to an explosive growth of the preclinical research dedicated to the isolation and identification of TCM-derived neuroprotective lead compounds. Tanshinone, is a typical example of TCM-derived lead compounds conferring neuroprotection toward IRI in animals with brain middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or TBI models. Recent reports show the significance of the inflammatory response accompanying brain IRI. This response appears to contribute to both primary and secondary ischemic pathology, and therefore anti-inflammatory strategies have become popular by targeting pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, other inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and several transcriptional factors. Here, we review recent selected studies and discuss further considerations for critical reevaluation of the neuroprotection hypothesis of TCMs in IRI therapy. Moreover, we will emphasize several TCM's mechanisms of action and attempt to address the most promising compounds and the obstacles to be overcome before they will enter the clinic for IRI therapy. We hope that this review will further help in investigations of neuroprotective effects of novel molecular entities isolated from Chinese herbal medicines and will stimulate performance of clinical trials of Chinese herbal medicine-derived drugs in IRI patients.

30841666|t|[Different anthropometric indices and incident risk of hypertension in elderly population: a prospective cohort study].
30841666|a|Objective: To explore the relationship between anthropometric indices and the incident risk of hypertension, compare novel anthropometric indices with traditional indices in hypertension prediction and establish hypertension prediction models among elderly Chinese. Methods: A total of 27 009 retirees from the Dongfeng Motor Corporation were recruited at baseline in 2008 and the first follow-up was conducted in 2013. After the exclusion of participants less than 60 years old, participants with hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and those with missing data, a total of 6 784 elderly participants were enrolled in this study. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between traditional anthropometric indices, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), novel anthropometric indices, visceral adiposity index (VAI), body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), and the incident risk of hypertension. Meanwhile, a multivariate logistic regression model was used to establish hypertension prediction models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to compare the prediction ability of different models. Results: A total of 1 787 incident cases of hypertension were identified, with the incidence of hypertension about 27.59%. Significant positive associations were detected between BMI, WC, WHtR, VAI, BRI and the incident risk of hypertension after adjusting for potential confounders (all P values<0.05). In men, the OR (95%CI) (upper tertile vs lower tertile) was 1.45 (1.22-1.73) for VAI, and 1.86 (1.55-2.23) for BRI. In women, the OR (95% CI) (upper tertile vs lower tertile) was 1.55 (1.22-1.96) for VAI, and 1.60 (1.27-2.01) for BRI. For ABSI, no significant association was observed in either men (OR (95%CI): 1.07 (0.90-1.28)) or women (OR (95%CI): 1.03 (0.82-1.29), both P values >0.05). The basic hypertension prediction model included age, drinking (only in men), education status (only in men), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and fasting blood glucose levels. Based on the basic prediction model, BMI (in men: AUC=0.697) and BRI (only in men: AUC=0.696) improved area under ROC curve (AUC) significantly (P<0.05). BMI was the strongest predictor in both men (AUC=0.697) and women (AUC=0.685) in the extended model. Conclusion: Significant positive associations were detected between BMI, WC, WHtR, VAI, BRI and the incident risk of hypertension among elderly Chinese. BMI was the strongest predictor in hypertension prediction model compared with other anthropometric indices.

30711712|t|Post stroke depression and risk of stroke recurrence and mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
30711712|a|BACKGROUND: Post stroke depression is a significant neuropsychiatric manifestation, predicting a range of poor outcomes. There are several studies investigating the association between post stroke depression and stroke recurrence/mortality, but results have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta regression of observational studies assessing the association between post stroke depression and risk of stroke recurrence and mortality. METHODS: A search of Medline (via PubMed), Web of Science databases, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted until August 2018. We extracted and pooled hazard ratios from observational studies that reported the risk estimates of stroke recurrence and mortality in stroke survivors with/without depression. RESULTS: The reviewed sample comprised 15 prospective cohort studies with 250,294 participants, 139,276 cases, and follow-up periods ranging from 1 to 15 years. The meta-analysis concluded a hazard ratio for post stroke depression and all-cause mortality of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.30-1.96), but research to date has been insufficient to determine the association between post stroke depression and stroke recurrence. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Post stroke depression is associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality in stroke survivors. More researches are required on the association with stroke recurrence.

31032278|t|The reporting quality of acupuncture for neurogenesis in experimental ischemic stroke study.
31032278|a|Background: There is increasing evidence demonstrating the highly inadequate reporting of preclinical research in multiple scientific publications. The purpose of this study is to systematically investigate the reporting quality of acupuncture for neurogenesis in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. Methods: We searched eight databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP information database, Wanfang data Information Site, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed by using the CAMARADES 10-item checklist. The STRICTA statement was modified to gear to animal acupuncture research. The reporting quality was assessed according to the ARRIVE guidelines and the modified STRICTA statement. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results: Ultimately, 44 studies containing 2,411 subjects were identified. The overall compliance with the CAMARADES 10-item checklist has a mean of 4.3. The reporting quality indicated that the overall compliance with ARRIVE guidelines has a mean of 59.9% and with the modified STRICTA statement a mean of 71.8%. The findings suggest that the reporting quality of acupuncture for preclinical stroke was generally poor. Conclusions: Full compliance with ARRIVE guidelines and/or modified STRICTA statement in designing, conducting and reporting preclinical acupuncture research is urgently needed in the future.

30594788|t|Tongluojiunao, a traditional Chinese medication with neuroprotective ability: A review of the cellular, molecular and physiological mediators of TLJN's effectiveness.
30594788|a|The pressing need to discover more effective drugs for various CNS disorders has resurrected the idea of investigating the effectiveness of traditional medicines in modern science. Tongluojiunao (TLJN) is an example of revived modern herbal preparation based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with a long history of administration for various types of cerebrovascular injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. TLJN is prepared from the herbal roots of Panax notoginseng (Sanchi) and dried fruits of Gardenia jasminoides (Cape Jasmine), and so far, it has demonstrated promising results in patients with vascular dementia and cerebral ischemic stroke. TLJN has also demonstrated therapeutic ability regarding the slowly-progressed neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. So it tempted us to undertake a thorough review of various features of TLJN therapeutic effects on the mentioned CNS conditions, including the cellular and molecular targets, inflammatory responses, neurogenesis and angiogenesis mediators and cognitive function. For this purpose, multiple global and local databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were checked out and the retrieved information was grouped according to their scope of studies. Among these, TLJN is reported to restore the deregulated cell-cell communication in the neurovascular unit, prevent the stress-related challenges imposed by ischemia/reperfusion insult, help with the cerebral tissue recovery after traumatic brain damage, avoid the epileptic seizure attack and limit the progression of Alzheimer's disease. We hope that the current review provides new insights into TLJN medication as a prospective neuroprotective medication for further more in-depth investigation in the future.

30414726|t|Achyranthes bidentata polypeptide k improves long-term neurological outcomes through reducing downstream microvascular thrombosis in experimental ischemic stroke.
30414726|a|Achyranthes bidentata Bl. (A. bidentata) occupies an important position in traditional Chinese medicine owing to the property of promoting the circulation of blood and removing stasis. Achyranthes bidentata polypeptide k (ABPPk) is one of the active components isolated from A. bidentata. We previously demonstrated that ABPPk has potent neuroprotective effects against neuronal apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, but the roles and mechanisms of ABPPk on long-term functional recovery after ischemic stroke remain unknown. In the current study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of ABPPk on filament transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rats and found that ABPPk reduced the infarct volume and maintained the neuronal integrity in the ischemic penumbra. Moreover, we found that ABPPk might reduce the formation of downstream microthrombus through preventing ischemic-induced oxidative damage of brain endothelial cells and activation of tissue factor (TF), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and NF-κB. ABPPk also inhibited polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) infiltration and matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 (MMP-2/-9) activation in the ischemic penumbra. Morris water maze, foot fault test, and modified neurological severity score were assessed for a period of 6 weeks following tMCAO. ABPPk improved long-term recognition abilities and neurological outcomes after stroke compared with saline-treated rats. Taken together, these results suggested that ABPPk is beneficial to the improvement of long-term outcomes after transient cerebral ischemia injury and can be used as a potential neuroprotective agent.

30666520|t|Myosin IIA Regulated Tight Junction in Oxygen Glucose-Deprived Brain Endothelial Cells Via Activation of TLR4/PI3K/Akt/JNK1/2/14-3-3ε/NF-κB/MMP9 Signal Transduction Pathway.
30666520|a|Non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMMHC IIA), a member of Myosin II family, plays a critical role in various cellular physiological processes. Our previous research had suggested that NMMHC IIA could participate in regulating tight junction morphological changes induced by ischemia stroke. Thus, in the current study, we attempted to uncover the regulation pattern of NMMHC IIA on tight junction dysfunction in oxygen glucose-deprived (OGD) mouse brain bEND.3 endothelial cells. The regulation of NMMHC IIA on tight junction in OGD-stimulated bEND.3 cells was evaluated by western blotting assay. Morphologic change of occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1 tight junction proteins was compared with pretreatment with NMMHC II inhibitor blebbistatin via immunohistochemical staining. Detection of activation of NMMHC IIA on OGD-mediated tight junction transduction pathway was investigated via Koch's postulate using corresponding protein inhibitor. Our results showed that NMMHC IIA was activated in OGD-stimulated bEND.3 endothelial cells. The inhibition of NMMHC IIA could attenuate the morphologic change of occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1 tight junction proteins. NMMHC IIA participated in regulating downstream transduction pathway TLR4, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, JNK1/2, 14-3-3ε, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-кB) and matrix metalloprotein 9 (MMP9). Blocking of these pathways using indicated inhibitors demonstrated that NMMHC IIA destroyed the connection of tight junction via the activation of TLR4/PI3K/Akt/JNK1/2/14-3-3ε/NF-κB/MMP9 pathway. Our study described the key role of NMMHC IIA in OGD-stimulated mouse brain bEND.3 endothelial cells, while also exhibited the molecule effect on tight junction dysfunction via TLR4/PI3K/Akt/JNK1/2/14-3-3ε/NF-κB/MMP9 signal transduction pathway.

This study is aimed to evaluate the protective effect of YQTL on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and inquire into its underlying mechanisms. Cerebral I/R injury was induced by occluding the middle cerebral artery for 2 h followed by 24 h reperfusion. And regional cerebral flow was monitored by Laser Doppler flow during ischemia phase. The infarct volume was evaluated by Triphenyte-trazolium chloride staining. The protective effects of YQTL were assessed by a number of parameters, including neurological scores, regional cerebral blood flow, pathological changes of neuron in hippocampuses and hippocampus calcium level. The proteins of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (GluN2B) and p-calcium-dependent protein kinaseII (CaMKII) response were assayed by Western blotting. I/R caused significant change in neurological deficit scores, regional cerebral flow and infarct volume. However results in YQTL groups and Nimodipine Tablets (NMDP) group were reversed. Subsequently YQTL reduced I/R-induced calcium influx. Results of hematoxylin-eosin staining manifested that YQTL significantly improved neuronal injury after I/R in rats. Meanwhile, microdialysis data demonstrated that extracellular glutamate was increased in the striatum during ischemia reperfusion, which was reduced by YQTL. YQTL and mitogen-activated protein extracellular kinase (MEK) inhibitor suppressed the I/R-mediated over-expression of GluN2B, p-ERK, ERK and p-CaMKII proteins expression. Putting these together, our results suggest that YQTL played a neuroprotective role in cerebral I/R injury, which might be exerted by inhibiting the excitotoxicity and expression of GluN2B, p-CaMKII and MEK/ERK signal pathway.

30704331|t|Acupuncture combined with Buyang Huanwu decoction in treatment of patients with ischemic stroke.
30704331|a|OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to investigate the effect of acupuncture combined with Buyang Huanwu decoction in patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS: In total, 115 patients with ischemic stroke were recruited and divided into 3 groups. The control group received normal treatment, the acupuncture group received additional acupuncture treatment, and the combined group received additional acupuncture combined with Buyang Huanwu decoction treatment. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Chinese Stroke Scale (CSS) were used to evaluate the stroke condition, and the Barthel index (BI) was used to measure life quality. Blood lipids and recurrence were also analyzed. RESULTS: The CSS and NIHSS scores were significantly lower in the acupuncture group and combined group than in the control group; however, the BI score was significantly higher in the acupuncture group and combined group. Similarly, the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein were all significantly increased, while the level of high-density lipoprotein showed no significant difference in all groups. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in the combined group than in the other two groups. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture combined with Buyang Huanwu decoction could improve the clinical outcomes and reduce the recurrence rates in patients with ischemic stroke.

30726543|t|Electroacupuncture Reduced Apoptosis of Hippocampal Neurons in Mice with Cerebral Infarction by Regulating the Notch3 Signaling Pathway.
30726543|a|This study is designed to explore the effect of electric acupuncture on the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons through the Notch3 signaling pathway. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model was generated by thread embolization. A Y-maze was used to test cognitive function (learning and memory). The apoptosis factor caspase-3 was identified through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TTC staining was used to evaluate the cerebral infarction area. Apoptosis of hippocampal neurons was identified by TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. The expression levels of genes and proteins related to the Notch3 signaling pathway were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. It was determined that 7 days of electroacupuncture treatment improved recovery from cerebral infarction. Electroacupuncture therapy reduced the cerebral infarction area in mice and decreased the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. The apoptosis rate of hippocampal neurons and the area of cerebral infarction were significantly lower in the electroacupuncture group than in the MCAO group (P < 0.01), while the apoptosis rate of hippocampal neurons and the area of cerebral infarction were significantly higher in the inhibitor group than in the electroacupuncture group (P < 0.01). The expression levels of genes related to the Notch3 signaling pathway were significantly increased in the electric acupuncture treatment group compared with the MCAO group (P < 0.01). The results showed that electroacupuncture inhibited the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons through the Notch3 signaling pathway, while the expression levels of genes related to the Notch3 signaling pathway were significantly higher in the inhibitor group than in the electroacupuncture group (P < 0.01). Electroacupuncture inhibited the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in mice with cerebral infarction by stimulating the Notch3 signaling pathway and triggering corresponding protein expression.

30552029|t|Electroacupuncture Regulates Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity via Inhibiting Janus-Activated Kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 Signaling in Cerebral Ischemic Rats.
30552029|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the mechanism(s) involved in electroacupuncture (EA)-mediated improvements in synaptic plasticity in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R)-induced cognitive deficits. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemic stroke was induced by (MCAO/R) surgery. Rats were randomly split into 4 groups: control group (sham operation control), MCAO group, Baihui (GV 20) and Shenting (GV 24) acupoint EA group (verum acupuncture, MCAO + VA), and nonacupoint EA group (control acupuncture, MCAO + CA). EA treatment was administered for 14 consecutive days in MCAO + VA and MCAO + CA groups. Neurological assessment, behavioral performance testing, and molecular biology assays were used to evaluate the MCAO/R model, EA therapeutic effect and potential therapeutic mechanism(s) of EA. RESULTS: Significant amelioration of neurological deficits was found in MCAO + VA rats compared with MCAO rats (P < .01). Moreover, learning and memory significantly improved in EA-treated rats compared with MCAO or MCAO + CA rats (P < .05) together with an increase in the number of PSD-95+ and SYN+ cells and synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region (P < .05). MCAO + VA rats also showed amelioration of pathological synaptic ultrastructural changes compared with MCAO or MCAO + CA groups (P < .001). In contrast, EA decreased the levels and phosphorylation of JAK2 (Janus-activated kinase 2) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) in the hippocampal CA1 region compared with MCAO or MCAO + CA group (P < .01). CONCLUSION: EA at GV 20 and GV 24 acupoints improved cognitive deficits in cerebral ischemic rats via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and mediated synaptic plasticity in the peri-infarct hippocampal CA1 region of rats following ischemic stroke.

30528673|t|Neuroprotective Effect of Dichloromethane Extraction From Piper nigrum L. and Piper longum L. on Permanent Focal Cerebral Ischemia Injury in Rats.
30528673|a|BACKGROUND: Piper nigrum L. and Piper longum L. consist a classic formula in traditional Chinese Hui medicine and are widely used in treatment of stroke. To examine the therapeutic effect of neuron injury after apoplexy, we used a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats to investigate the effects of dichloromethane fraction (DF) of Piper nigrum L. and Piper longum L. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After subjecting the rats to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, DF (100 and 200 mg/kg) were administered for 14 days. Neurological deficits and the degree of cerebral tissue injury was detected by 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride Staining Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Nissl staining. Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), synapsin-I (syn-I), and α-synuclein (α-syn) were stained by immunohistochemistry. PSD-95, Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II), phosphorylated CaMK II (p-CaMK II), CaM, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B) expression were detected by Western blot. Meanwhile, phytochemical profile of DF was determined through ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). RESULTS: DF alleviated neurological deficits and markedly prevented ischemia-induced cellular damage. Immunohistochemical micrographs revealed that PSD-95 and syn-I proteins increased, and α-syn presented reduced expression in brain samples from the sham group. Western blot analyses revealed that the model group exhibited a noticeable reduction in PSD-95, p-CaMK II, CaM, and NR2B. The DF-treated model group exhibited increased PSD-95, p-CaMK II, CaM, and NR2B. UPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis revealed eight main components of DF, of which piperine accounted for the largest proportion.

30896633|t|The relationship between smoking and stroke: A meta-analysis.
30896633|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability for adult men and women worldwide, and a number of studies have explored the influences of smoking on stroke. However, few studies have discussed the relationship between stroke and smoking with consideration of the following factors: sex, the number of cigarettes smoked per day, stroke subtype, and the follow-up duration. Consequently, we aimed to extend previous work by using a systematic review to explore the relationship between stroke and cigarette smoking in reference to the above factors. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register databases and the following search criteria: ["stroke" (MeSH) and "smoking" (MeSH)]. All analyses were conducted with Stata, and funnel plots and Egger regression asymmetry tests were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 14 studies involving 303134 subjects. According to the meta-analysis, smokers had an overall increased risk of stroke compared with nonsmokers, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.61 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34-1.93, P < .001). A subgroup analysis conducted based on smoking status revealed ORs of 1.92 (95% CI: 1.49-2.48) for current smokers and 1.30 (95% CI: 0.93-1.81) for former smokers. In addition, the relationship between stroke of any type and smoking status was also statistically significant; current smokers had an increased risk of stoke compared with nonsmokers (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.04-2.07, P < .001), which was influenced by sex (men: OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.11-2.13, P = .002; women: OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.45-2.44, P < .023). From the analysis, we also observed that passive smoking increased the overall risk of stroke by 45% (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.0-2.11, P < .05). Based on the dose-response meta-analysis, the risk of stroke increased by 12% for each increment of 5 cigarettes per day.

30611759|t|Valproic acid attenuates global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in gerbils via anti-pyroptosis pathways.
30611759|a|Ischemic stroke is the third most common cause of death and the leading cause of disability worldwide in adults. The antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) was reported to protect cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the action mechanism of VPA in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury has not been fully understood. We explored the action mechanism of VPA in vivo and in vitro. Gerbils were subjected to transient global cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury, and hippocampal neuron injury was treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro. Morris water maze test was performed to evaluate the cognitive dysfunction. Histopathological examinations and western blot were performed to evaluate the pyroptosis of neurons. The results showed that VPA attenuated the cognitive dysfunction, pyroptosis of the gerbils suffer from ischemic-reperfusion injury and decreased hippocampal neurons pyroptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro. In addition, western blot and real-time PCR analysis revealed that VPA modulated the protein expression of apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC), caspase-1 and IL-1β/IL-18. Our results suggested that VPA alleviated ischemic/reperfusion injury-mediated neuronal impairment by anti-pyroptotic effects.

30660824|t|The cardioprotective properties and the involved mechanisms of NaoXinTong Capsule.
30660824|a|NaoXinTong Capsule (NXT), a prescribed traditional Chinese medicine, is made up of 16 natural herbal materials with more than 200 identified bioactive compounds. Multiple protective effects of NXT on cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome, coronary microembolization, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and ischemia-reperfusion injury, have been reported by both clinical and basic studies. Biologically, these cardioprotective effects can be correlated to the actions of NXT on inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, neovascularization, insulin sensitivity and lipid/glucose metabolism. NXT alone or in combination with the conventional interventions has been demonstrated potent therapeutic effects on cardiovascular diseases without causing significant adverse events, like the major bleeding. Compared with the conventional drugs, patients have a good tolerance and little resistance to NXT treatment. With the data and evidence reported from lab benches to clinical beds, we will update the cardioprotective properties of NXT and the involved mechanisms in this review. We hope the information provided in this review can help readers to better understand the insights for the long practice of this traditional Chinese medicine, and offer fresh perspectives.

29961182|t|Association between insomnia and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Han Chinese individuals in Shandong Province, China.
29961182|a|PURPOSE: Diabetes and sleep disorders are public health threats worldwide, but the potential association between them is still unclear. METHODS: We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study including 5078 participants (2665, 52.5% male) to determine the association between insomnia and diabetes mellitus prevalence. RESULTS: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nondiabetic controls, the prevalence of insomnia was 20.2% (68/377) and 12.2% (578/4741), respectively. The results showed that insomnia was associated with T2DM after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, presence of disease history (hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, cancers), and depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.66). After stratifying by age and sex, insomnia was significantly associated with diabetes mellitus only in the subgroup of middle-aged participants (40-59 years) (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.16-2.23) and males (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.03) after controlling for the above covariates. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that insomnia is independently and significantly associated with diabetes mellitus in the northern Chinese population, especially in the 40-59-year-old age group and in males.

30945493|t|[Deep acupuncture of Lianquan (CV23) and Yifeng (TE17) in combination with conventional acupuncture of other acupoints is superior to swallowing rehabilitation training in improving post-stroke dysphagia in apoplexy patients].
30945493|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of dysphagia in apoplexy patients. METHODS: A total of 104 patients with post-stroke dysphagia were randomized into a control (conventional swallowing rehabilitation training) group and an acupuncture group (n＝ 52 cases in each one). In the control group, the conventional swallowing rehabilitation training was conducted, twice daily, 6 times a week for 4 weeks. In the acupuncture group, deep needling of main acupoints Lianquan (CV23) and Yifeng (TE17), and conventional acupuncture of adjuvant acupoints as Fengchi (GB20) and Fengfu (GV16), Wangu (GB12), Lieque (LU7), Jinjin (EX-HN12), Yuye (EX-HN13), etc. as well as electroacupuncture stimulation (15－20 Hz, 5 mA, and duration of 30 min) of ipsilateral CV23-GV16, TE17-GB20, and bilateral Neidaying acupoints were conducted. The acupuncture treatment was given once daily, 6 times a week for consecutive 4 weeks. In addition, patients of the two groups also received routine symptomatic treatment with drugs for anti-platelet aggregation, nourishing cranial nerve, lowering blood pressure, controlling blood glucose, improving cerebral circulation, etc. Before and after the treatment, the standard swallowing assessment (SSA, 18－46 points) and Kubota water swallowing test (WST, 1－5 grades) were conducted to evaluate the patient's swallowing function. The comprehensive therapeutic effect was assessed in accordance with the SSA and Kubota WST, and adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: After the treatment, the SSA score was considerably reduced in the two groups relevant to their own pre-treatment (both P<0.05), and was significantly lower in the acupuncture group than in the control group (P<0.05). The Kubota WST grade was evidently increased in the number of patients with grade Ⅰ (P<0.05) and reduced in the numbers of patients with grade Ⅲ－Ⅴ in both groups relevant to their own pre-treatment, and was more patients with grade Ⅰ in the acupuncture group than in the control group (P<0.05). Outcomes of the comprehensive therapeutic effect indicated that of the two 52 cases in the control and acupuncture groups, 8 (15.38%) and 19 (36.53%) were cured, 7 (13.46%) and 15 (28.45%) had marked improvement, 17 (32.69%) and 12 (23.08%) were effective, and 20 (38.46%) and 6 (11.54%) failed in the treatment, with the effective rate being 61.54% and 88.46%, respectively. The total effective rate of the acupuncture group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). The adverse reactions such as regional hematoma (in 3 cases) and pain (in 2 cases) in the acupuncture group, and choking-coughing in the control group were seen, being 9.62% and 11.54% in the incidence rate, respectively. CONCLUSION: Deep needling of main acupoints Lianquan (CV23) and Yifeng (TE 17) in combination with conventional acupuncture of other acupoints is effective in improving local glossopharyngeal function in apoplexy patients with dysphagia, which is obviously superior to conventional swallowing rehabilitation training in the therapeutic effect and is applicable in clinical practice.

30813246|t|GC-MS-Based Metabolomics to Reveal the Protective Effect of Gross Saponins of Tribulus terrestris Fruit against Ischemic Stroke in Rat.
30813246|a|Stroke is one of the most common neurological disorders and seriously threatens human life. Gross saponins of Tribulus terrestris fruit (GSTTF) are used for neuroprotective treatment on convalescents of ischemic stroke. However, the therapeutic effects and mechanisms have not yet well understood, especially from the metabolic perspective. In this study, the protective effect of GSTTF on ischemic stroke in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was investigated by the GC-MS-based metabolomics approach. 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of brain tissues showed that GSTTF significantly reduced the infarct area after MCAO surgery. Metabolomic profiling showed a series of metabolic perturbation occurs in ischemic stroke compared with sham group. GSTTF can reverse the MCAO-induced serum metabolic deviations by regulating multiple metabolic pathways including fatty acids metabolism, amino acids metabolism, and carbohydrates metabolism. The current study provided a useful approach for understanding the mechanism of MCAO-induced ischemic stroke and a reliable basis for evaluating the efficacy of GSTTF in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

30846938|t|The Effects of Breviscapine Injection on Hypertension in Hypertension-Induced Renal Damage Patients: A Systematic Review and a Meta-Analysis.
30846938|a|Background: Breviscapine (Dengzhanhua) injection has been wildly used in clinical treatment for cerebral infarction, cardiovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy, renal impairment of essential hypertension and stroke in China. Breviscapine injection and antihypertensive drugs combination therapy is supposed to be beneficial for hypertension-induced renal damage patients. Objectives: To evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of breviscapine injection on hypertension in hypertension-induced renal damage patients, an extensive meta-analysis was performed. Methods: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Sino Med, VIP, and Wanfang Data for relevant literature. The timeframe of retrieval was set from the founding date of each database to September 28, 2018. Results: Fourteen papers were included in this study. The quality of all the studies included was determined to be low. All studies were conducted with Chinese populations. Meta-analysis showed that, compared with single-use antihypertensive drugs, using breviscapine injection in combination with antihypertensive drugs to treat hypertension in hypertension-induced renal damage patients can reduce 24-h urinary total protein (24 h UTP) [WMD = -0.04, 95% CI (-0.05, -0.02), P ≤ 0.001], but does not lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) [WMD = -1.02, 95% CI (-2.88, 0.84), P = 0.281] or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [WMD = -0.21, 95% CI (-1.71, 1.29), P = 0.786] more effectively. There was also no statistically significant difference in adverse events between experimental groups and control groups. Conclusion: Breviscapine injection, in combination with antihypertensive drugs, appears to be more effective in improving the 24 h UTP, but overall have no effect on improving the blood pressure in hypertension-induced renal damage patients. Moderate dose of breviscapine injection (10 ml) may have effects on reducing blood pressure in hypertension-induced renal damage patients but high doses of breviscapine injection (20 ml) may increase blood pressure by subgroup analysis. However, the evidence of methodological quality and sample sizes is weak, and thus, further standardized research is required.

30842736|t|FGF21 Protects Against Hypoxia Injury Through Inducing HSP72 in Cerebral Microvascular Endothelial Cells.
30842736|a|Background: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a member of a family of atypical FGFs, functions as cytokine to control endocrinology and metabolism. Recently, the roles of FGF21 in cardio-cerebral-vascular diseases have been gradually uncovered. In the present study, we investigated the effect of FGF21 on bEnd.3 cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) upon hypoxia stress. Methods and Results: CMECs were cultured in the condition of 1% O2 for 8 h to induce hypoxia stimuli. For FGF21 treatment, recombinant FGF21 (50 nM) was added into the culture medium. Various biomedical assays were used to evaluate the hypoxia-induced injury in CMECs. Under normoxia condition, FGF21 had no obvious effect on cell viability and did not cause any cytotoxicity on CMECs. Under hypoxia condition, FGF21 significantly attenuated the hypoxia-induced injury, evidenced by the influences of FGF21 on CMEC viability and LDH release. TUNEL staining assay and immunoblotting of caspase-3 showed that FGF21 reduced hypoxia-induced apoptosis in CMECs. Mechanistically, FGF21 treatment compromised the hypoxia-induced changes of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, total antioxidant activity, and total superoxide dismutase levels. FGF21 administration decreased hypoxia-induced matrix metalloprotein 3 and matrix metalloprotein 2/9 activity in CMECs. Activities of cyclooxygenase-2 and NF-κB-p65, two pro-inflammatory factors, were also upregulated by hypoxia but suppressed by FGF21. At last, we found that FGF21 increased heat shock protein family A member 1A (HSP72) mRNA and protein expression. Blockade of HSP72 by a pharmacological inhibitor VER155008 or specific siRNA-mediated knockdown abrogated the protection of FGF21 against hypoxia in CMECs. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that FGF21 protects against hypoxia stress-induced injury in CMECs by inducing HSP72 expression, suggesting a therapeutic value of FGF21 in hypoxia-related brain diseases such as ischemic stroke and acute mountain sickness.

30682539|t|Identification and characterization of chemical constituents in Dengzhan Shengmai Capsule and their metabolites in rat plasma by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
30682539|a|Dengzhan Shengmai Capsule (DZSMC) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula with remarkable clinical effect in the treatment of stroke sequelae. Exploring the components of DZSMC and detecting the absorbed prototype constituents and metabolites in blood are of great significance to clarify the effective substances of this prescription. Here, a reliable method using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) was established for the comprehensive analysis of chemical constituents of DZSMC and their metabolites in rat plasma after gastric perfusion. Two acquisition modes, including MSE mode and Fast DDA mode, were performed for acquiring more precursor ions and cleaner precursor-product ions background during the study of constituents of DZSMC. As a result, a total of 125 constituents were unambiguously characterized or tentatively identified. For the first time, a total of 92 components, including 44 prototype components and 48 metabolites were unambiguously or tentatively identified in rat plasma. The metabolic pathways included phase I reactions (hydration, hydrogenation, oxidation, demethylation and hydroxylation) and phase II reactions (conjugation with glucuronide, sulfate and methyl). Furthermore, the metabolites from caffeic acid and scutellarin were characterized and validated by phase II metabolic reactions in vitro, which could be established as a simulated in vivo environment of metabolites identification and verification of TCM formula. It is the first systematic study on metabolism of DZSMC in vivo and could also provide a valid analytical strategy for characterization of the chemical compounds and metabolites of TCM formula.

30755169|t|Early risk assessment of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and plasma stromal cell-derived factor-1 for nondisabling ischemic cerebrovascular events.
30755169|a|BACKGROUND: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important role in ischemic stroke. However, there are few studies on the relationship between EPC and nondisabling ischemic cerebrovascular events. Our aim was to investigate the association of EPCs and SDF-1 (serum stromal cell-derived factor-1) with NICE (nondisabling ischemic cerebrovascular events). METHODS: TIA (transient ischemic attack) and minor stroke patients (153 in total) who had an onset of symptoms within 1 day were consecutively collected. 83 of the patients were categorized into the HR-NICE (high-risk nondisabling ischemic cerebrovascular event) group, and 70 of the patients were in the NHR-NICE (non-high-risk nondisabling ischemic cerebrovascular events) group. Adopted FCM (flow cytometry) was used to measure EPCs, taking double-positive CD34/KDR as EPCs. ELISA was used to measure the concentrations of serum SDF-1 and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). By the sequence of admission time, 15 patients were selected separately from the HR-NICE group and NHR-NICE group, and another 15 healthy volunteers were chosen as the NC (Normal Control) group. The MTT method was used to measure the proliferation of EPCs of peripheral blood in all groups, and the Boyden chamber was used to measure the migration of EPCs. RESULTS: Compared with the NHR-NICE group, the HR-NICE group was older and contained more patients with hypertension and diabetes. Triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein in the HR-NICE group were also higher. For factors such as smoking, BMI (body mass index), and HCY (homocysteine), there were no significant differences (P > 0.05). Circulating EPCs, SDF-1, and VEGF in the NHR-NICE group were all higher. According to the multifactor regression analysis, age, hypertension, diabetes, total cholesterol, EPCs, and SDF-1 are independent risk factors for HR-NICE. For EPCs of 48-h isolated cultures, proliferation and migration were observed to be weakened compared with those of the NC group (P < 0.05). EPCs in HR-NICE group had lower proliferation and migration than those in NHR-NICE group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: For TIA and minor stroke patients, circulating EPCs and serum SDF-1 concentrations can be used to prognose HR-NICE. Factors that lead to high-risk NICE might be relevant to the decrease in proliferation and migration of circulating EPCs.

30390562|t|Distribution kinetics of puerarin in rat hippocampus after acute local cerebral ischemia.
30390562|a|Puerarin, isolated from the roots of Pueraria lobata, is widely used for treating cerebral ischemia in China. The time- and dose-dependent distribution characteristics of puerarin in the ischemic hippocampus are unknown. In this study, puerarin concentration was determined by an indirect competitive ELISA using anti-puerarin monoclonal antibody. Area under the curve (AUC0-120 min) of puerarin (80 mg/kg) in the embolic hippocampus was higher than that in the normal hippocampus; the increase was significant only at 40 and 20 mg/kg. The maximum concentration (Cmax) of puerarin in the embolic hippocampus was higher than that in the normal hippocampus at all doses. The increase in both AUC0-120 min and Cmax was dose-dependent. Time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax) of puerarin in the embolic and normal hippocampus was similar. Although the mean residence time in the embolic hippocampus differed from that in the normal hippocampus at 40 and 80 mg/kg, it was higher in the embolic hippocampus than in the normal hippocampus at 20 mg/kg. This is the first study to report that the time- and dose-dependent distribution characteristics of puerarin in the normal and embolic hippocampus after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats dictate puerarin dose and duration to treat stroke.

30717733|t|Decreased fracture incidence with traditional Chinese medicine therapy in patients with osteoporosis: a nationwide population-based cohort study.
30717733|a|BACKGROUND: There are no published studies regarding the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the prevention of osteoporotic fracture. Therefore, we conducted this nationwide, population-based cohort study to investigate the probable effect of TCM to decrease the fracture rate. METHODS: We identified cases with osteoporosis and selected a comparison group that was frequency-matched according to sex, age (per 5 years), diagnosis year of osteoporosis, and index year. The difference between the two groups in the development of fracture was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. RESULTS: After inserting age, gender, urbanization level, and comorbidities into the Cox's proportional hazard model, patients who used TCM had a lower hazard ratio (HR) of fracture (adjusted HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.37-0.59) compared to the non-TCM user group. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that osteoporosis patients who used TCM had a lower incidence of fracture events than those who did not (p < 0.00001). Our study also demonstrated that the longer the TCM use, the lesser the fracture rate. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that TCM might have a positive impact on the prevention of osteoporotic fracture.

30863452|t|Systems Pharmacology-Based Approach to Comparatively Study the Independent and Synergistic Mechanisms of Danhong Injection and Naoxintong Capsule in Ischemic Stroke Treatment.
30863452|a|To provide evidence for the better clinical use of traditional Chinese medicine preparations (TCMPs), comparison of the pharmacological mechanisms between TCMPs with similar therapeutic effect is necessary. However, methodology for dealing with this issue is still scarce. Danhong injection (DHI) and Naoxintong capsule (NXT) are representative TCMPs for ischemic stroke (IS) treatment, which are also frequently used in combination. Here they were employed as research objects to demonstrate the feasibility of systems pharmacology approach in elucidation of the independent and combined effect of TCMPs. By incorporating chemical screening, target prediction, and network construction, a feasible systems pharmacology model has been established to systematically uncover the underlying action mechanisms of DHI, NXT, or their pair in IS treatment. Systematic analysis of the created TCMP-Compound-Target-Disease network revealed that DHI and NXT shared common targets such as PTGS2, F2, ADRB1, IL6, ALDH2, and CCL2, which were involved in the vasomotor system regulation, blood-brain barrier disruption, redox imbalance, neurotrophin activity, and brain inflammation. In comparative mechanism study, the merged DHI/NXT-IS PPI network and pathway enrichment analysis indicated that DHI and NXT exerted the therapeutic effects mainly through immune system and VEGF signaling pathways. Meanwhile, they had their own unique pathways, e.g., calcium signaling pathway for DHI and gap junction for NXT. While for their synergistic mechanism, DHI and NXT participated in chemokine signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, gap junction, and so on. Our study provided an optimized strategy for dissecting the different and combined effect of TCMPs with similar actions.

30718622|t|Baduanjin exercise intervention for community adults at risk of ischamic stroke: A randomized controlled trial.
30718622|a|The aim of current study was to assess the effects of Baduanjin exercise on cerebrovascular function, cardiac structure and cardiac function, static pulmonary function, traditional risk factors of CVD and the related psychological outcomes in older community adults at risk for ischaemic stroke. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in three community between November 2013 and October 2015. Older community-dwelling adults (N = 170) were randomly allocated into either a Baduanjin training (5 × 60 min/weekly) or control group who kept their unaltered lifestyle during a 12-week intervention period. Primary (cerebral haemodynamic parameters) and secondary outcomes (cardiac structure, cardiac function, static pulmonary function, traditional risk factors and the related psychological outcomes) were measured at baseline, after a 12-week intervention period and after an additional 12-week follow-up period. After the 12-week intervention period and additional 12-week follow-up period, the Baduanjin exercise group displayed significant changes in most cerebral haemodynamic parameters compared to the control group: lower systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, plasma total cholesterol levels, waist circumference, hip circumference and waist/hip ratio; and improved mood, self-confidence, self-esteem, quality of life and sleep quality. A supervised 12-week Baduanjin exercise intervention was effective and safe in modulating cerebral haemodynamics, reducing blood pressure and improving anthropometric parameters and related psychological outcomes in older community adults at risk for ischaemic stroke.

30705768|t|Distribution Pattern of Atherosclerotic Stenosis in Chinese Patients with Stroke: A Multicenter Registry Study.
30705768|a|The aim of this multicenter study was to demonstrate the distribution pattern of atherosclerotic stenosis and its trend with aging between extracranial and intracranial arteries and its distribution between the anterior and posterior circulations in Chinese patients hospitalized with ischemic stroke. In addition, the risk factors for the distribution pattern were illustrated. From June 2015 to May 2016, 9,346 patients with ischemic stroke from 20 hospitals were enrolled. Carotid artery ultrasonography and transcranial color-coded sonography/transcranial Doppler were used to evaluate the extracranial and intracranial arteries. The distribution pattern of atherosclerotic stenosis and its trend with aging were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for the distribution pattern. Among the 9,346 patients, 2,882 patients (30.8%) had at least one artery with a degree of stenosis ≥50%. Among patients with arterial stenosis, the proportion of patients with intracranial artery stenosis was higher than those with extracranial artery stenosis (52.6% vs. 27.6%), and the proportion of anterior circulation artery stenosis was higher than that in the posterior circulation (52.2% vs.26.2%). With aging, the proportion of intracranial artery stenosis alone decreased; at the same time, the proportion of extracranial artery stenosis and extracranial plus intracranial artery stenosis increased (trend χ2=6.698, P=0.001). Hypertension (OR 1.416, P=0.008) and family history of stroke (OR 1.479, P=0.014) were risk factors for intracranial artery stenosis. Male, aging, and smoking were factors more related to extracranial artery stenosis. Aging (OR 1.022, P<0.001) and hypertension (OR 1.392, P=0.019) were related to posterior circulation artery stenosis. Intracranial arteries and anterior circulation arteries were susceptible to stenosis in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke. However, the distribution pattern of atherosclerotic stenosis was dynamic and varied with aging. Aging and different risk factors contribute to this distribution pattern.

30518742|t|Zhongfenggao Protects Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells from Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation-Induced Injury by Angiogenesis.
30518742|a|Zhongfenggao (ZFG) is prescribed for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases in critical projects of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. ZFG has been found to nourish qi, activate blood circulation, remove blood stasis, dredge collaterals, and strengthen the brain and mind. The present study investigated the effects of ZFG on oxygen-glucose deprivation-reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced injury to brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), and the mechanisms underlying such effects. BMECs are essential target cells of ischemic stroke. In order to simulate ischemic-like conditions in vitro, BMECs were exposed to glucose deprivation and hypoxia for 2 h. Results indicate that ZFG may protect OGD/R-induced injury to BMECs by promoting angiogenesis. Further, we observed that ZFG significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by OGD/R injury. ZFG significantly promoted migration and microtubule formation in BMECs under OGD/R conditions. Additionally, ZFG increased levels of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) significantly and activated the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways. The results of the present study indicate that ZFG may display a protective effect against OGD/R-induced BMECs injury by promoting angiogenesis via Notch and Wnt signaling pathways. These results provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic action of ZFG which shows promise as a potential drug candidate for treating cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.

30716389|t|Curcumin, the golden spice in treating cardiovascular diseases.
30716389|a|Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) cause the largest mortality worldwide, and much attention has been focused to unravel the mechanisms and optimize the treatment regimens. Curcumin is an important bioactive component of turmeric that has been widely applied as traditional medicine to prevent and treat various diseases in some countries. Recent studies have demonstrated its potent activities in modulating multiple signaling pathways associated with cellular growth, proliferation, survival, inflammation and oxidative stress. The cardiovascular protective properties of curcumin in CVDs have been fully illustrated in numerous studies. In this review, we first briefly introduce the medicinal history of curcumin. Secondly, we systematically analyze the preclinical studies of curcumin in CVDs such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, drug-induced cardiotoxicity, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, stroke and diabetic cardiovascular complications. The potential molecular targets of curcumin are also summarized. Thirdly, the clinical trials of curcumin in CVDs are overviewed and discussed. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic utility of derivatives of curcumin, and highlight existing problems of curcumin as an effective drug lead in treating CVDs.

GRADE criteria were used to rate the quality of evidence in systematic reviews considering 6 factors, including risk of bias. RESULTS: This review ultimately included 13 systematic reviews of 14 non-drug therapies (acupuncture, wet cupping, Baduanjin, blood letting, auricular acupuncture, music, massage, Qi gong, moxibustion, relaxation therapies, biofeedback, device-guided breathing, yoga and tai chi) based on the inclusion criteria. The quality of evidence was generally low, and weak recommendations were given for most therapies except massage and acupuncture plus antihypertensive drug. Based on the analyzed evidence, massage and acupuncture plus antihypertensive drug could benefit people who want to lower their BP and do not have contraindications for massage and acupuncture plus antihypertensive drug. DISCUSSION/STRENGTH: The GRADE approach makes this review a unique reference for people who are considering the grade of quality of evidence in systematic reviews, the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences and the strength of recommendations to decide which intervention should be used to reduce BP. LIMITATIONS: Many non-drug therapies were excluded due to the low methodological quality of their systematic reviews, and only 14 therapies were evaluated in this review. As no patient-important outcomes were reviewed, surrogate outcomes were used to rate the strength of recommendations. This approach may cause a decrease in evidence quality according to GRADE, but we argue that this is appropriate in the context of this review.

30762770|t|Efficacy and mechanism of acupuncture for ischemic poststroke depression: Study protocol for a multicenter single-blinded randomized sham-controlled trial.
30762770|a|INTRODUCTION: Poststroke depression is a serious and common complication of stroke, especially the ischemic poststroke depression. Antidepressants are used in poststroke depression, and acupuncture may be an alternative approach. However, the efficacy and mechanism of acupuncture for poststroke depression has not been confirmed. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multicenter, central-randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial. We will allocate 208 subjects aged between 40 and 80 years old, diagnosed with initial poststroke depression (PSD) within 6 months to 2 groups randomly in a ratio of 1:1. Patients in the experimental group will be treated with traditional acupuncture and placebo pills, whereas the others in the control group will be treated with sham-acupoints acupuncture and antidepressant (fluoxetine hydrochloride tablets). All will be given acupuncture and/or medication treatment for 12 weeks, and then received 12-week follow-up. Patients will be evaluated with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale and Se1f-rating Depression Scale for depression state, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale for neurological deficit, Modified Barthel Index for activities of daily living, Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale for side effects of treatments, diagnosis and evaluation criteria of traditional Chinese medicine for stroke (try out) for curative effects of stroke, and clinical global impression for synthesize effect before and the 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 12th week of treatment, 24th week of follow-up. Study on mechanisms of acupuncture will be revealed through the diversity of brain metabolites (choline-containing compounds [Cho], N-acetylaspartate [NAA], myoinositol, glutamine and glutamate complex, creatine [Cr], Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, Cr/NAA) in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex monitored by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and serum monoamine neurotransmitters (5-hydroxytryptamine, norepinephrine, dopamine) and cytokines (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], interleukin [IL]-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha) before and the 12th week of treatment. Baseline characteristics of patients will be summarized by groups and compared with chi-square for categorical variables, and 2-sample t tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the continuous variables. Primary and secondary outcomes according to the measurement times are applicable to univariate repetitive measurement deviation analysis or 2-sample t tests, or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. CONCLUSION: The present research is designed to investigate efficacy and mechanism of traditional acupuncture therapy on ischemic PSD, also to explore the correlation between cerebra metabolic and serologic factors, and ischemic PSD. With this research, we are looking forward to find out an appropriate alternative nondrug therapy for PSD people to alleviate the adverse effects and drug dependence caused by antidepressants.

30707716|t|Prognostic role of early D-dimer level in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
30707716|a|OBJECT: The purpose of our study was to assess the prognostic role of early D-dimer level in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: The included patients' D-dimer levels have to be tested within 24 hours from stroke onset. Poor functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≥3. The endpoints included recurrence on 5-day diffusion-weighted imaging, 30-day mRS ≥3, 30-day mortality and 90-day mRS ≥3. Regarding to each endpoint, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the prognostic role of D-dimer in patients with AIS. RESULTS: A total of 2,479 patients were included. The results showed that elevated D-dimer levels were associated with recurrence on 5-day diffusion-weighted imaging (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.32-3.95), 30-day mRS≥3 (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.37-1.85), 30-day mortality (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.27-2.90) and 90-day mRS≥3 (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.05-2.46). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, for patients with AIS, higher D-dimer level within 24 hours from stroke onset was associated with recurrence on 5-day diffusion-weighted imaging, mortality at 30 days, and poor functional outcome at both 30 days and 90 days. However, more studies are warranted to clarify this issue.

30989929|t|[Fangji Dihuang Decoction formula syndrome and Fengyin Decoction formula syndrome:application in stroke and mental disorders].
30989929|a|Fangji Dihuang Decoction and Fengyin Decoction, which were firstly recorded in Synopsis of the Golden Chamber, could be used to treat stroke. However, both of these two decoctions are used infrequently. There is a clear pathogenesis of modern pathophysiology behind Fangji Dihuang Decoction syndrome and Fengyin Decoction syndrome, which can be interpreted by modern language of science. Fangji Dihuang Decoction can nourish Yin, tonify kidney, extinguish the wind, and dredge collaterals. It could be used to treat mania caused by cerebral infarction, senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease and other cerebrovascular diseases, and opened up the precedent of nourishing Yin and expelling wind to treat stroke in later generations. Fengyin Decoction can clear heat, extinguish the wind, and calm the mind. It can be used to treat cerebral infarction, limb paralysis and epileptic seizures with heat syndrome. It may be equivalent to "oriental olanzapine", and opened up the precedent of smoothing liver and suppressing Yang to treat stroke in later generations. They can be used in the combination, with a high application value in treating stroke and mental diseases.

30989903|t|[Research progress on pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and traditional Chinese medicine commonly used for treatment of ischemic stroke].
30989903|a|Stroke has become the second leading cause of death in the world, and the most common type is the ischemic stroke. Due to its rapid onset and complex conditions, ischemic stroke is a major neurological disorder that causes disability. Ischemic stroke mainly results from atherosclerosis, and the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke mainly includes energy metabolism disorders in the brain, the toxicity of excitatory amino acids, oxidative/nitrification stress, inflammatory response, apoptosis, and autophagy. With the characteristics of multi-component and multi-target, traditional Chinese medicine could be used to treat ischemic stroke at different stages. This article summarized the latest research progress on the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and commonly used traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of ischemic stroke in order to provide references for the further research and clinical treatment of ischemic stroke.

30834266|t|Statins for the Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease.
30834266|a|Object: The purpose of this study was to fully assess the role of statins in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: We searched six databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, and Chinese Scientific Journal Database) to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to 31 October 2017. Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality and analysed the data using Rev Man 5.3 software. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were pooled using fixed/random-effects models. Funnel plots and Begg's test were conducted to assess publication bias. The quality of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: Sixteen RCTs with 69159 participants were included in this review. Statins can effectively decrease the occurrence of angina (RR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.58~0.85, I2 =0%), nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.51~0.69, I2 =14%), fatal MI (RR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.24~0.98, I2 =0%), any MI (RR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.42~0.67, I2 =0%), any coronary heart events (RR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.68~0.78, I2=0%), coronary revascularization (RR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.55~0.78, I2 = 0%), and any cardiovascular events (RR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.72~82, I2 = 0%). However, based on the current evidence, there were no significant differences in CHD deaths (RR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.66~1.02, I2=0%) and all-cause mortality (RR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.76 ~1.01, I2 =58%) between the two groups. Additionally, statins were more likely to result in diabetes (RR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.05~1.39, I2 =0%). There was no evidence of publication biases, and the quality of the evidence was considered moderate. Conclusion: Statins seemed to be beneficial for the primary prevention of CHDs but have no effect on CHD death and all-cause mortality.

30773868|t|[Progress of researches on acupuncture treatment of diseases by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress].
30773868|a|Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is one of the major defense networks in mammals, but continuous ERS will lead to cell apoptosis, inducing initiation and progression of many human diseases. Biochemical, physiological and pathological stimuli induced ERS may help the cells adapt to and survive stress conditions by activating unfolded protein response (UPR), ER-overload response and sterol modulation cascade reaction. Abundant outcomes of clinical and experimental studies in recent 5 years showed that acupuncture and moxibustion therapies are effective in improving some symptoms of nervous system diseases as stroke, Parkinson's disease, convulsion, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, spinal cord injury, muscular injury, etc., which is closely associated with their functions in relieving excessive ERS and cell apoptosis via modulating UPR pathway. Some important molecules or signaling pathways such as glucose-regulated protein 78(GRP78), Caspase-12, ER transmembrane kinase inositol-requiring and ER-to-nucleus signaling protein (IRE1P), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK)/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α(eIF2α), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), etc. have been demonstrated to be involved in the effects of acupuncture-moxibustion interventions. But, the mechanism of acupuncture-moxibustion underlying improvement of ERS remains far more unclear. Future studies targeting the combination of molecules and holistic function, verification of changes of the involved protein molecules and multiple signaling pathways, balancing regulation between the cell survival and apoptosis, etc. by adopting syndrome-differentiation-based acupoints are definitely needed.

30800683|t|Influences of Corydalis decumbens on the Activities of CYP450 Enzymes in Rats with a Cocktail Approach.
30800683|a|Corydalis decumbens, a Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been widely used for the alternative and/or complementary therapy of hypertension, arrhythmias rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica, stroke, hemiplegia, paraplegia, and vascular embolism. The aim of this study was to determinate the potential effects of Corydalis decumbens on the five cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities (CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6) by cocktail approach. To evaluate whether concurrent use of Corydalis decumbens interferes with the effect of several prescription drugs, saline (control group) or Corydalis decumbens (XTW group) were administrated via gavage for 7 successive days. A probe cocktail solution (phenacetin, omeprazole, metoprolol, tolbutamide, and midazolam) was given 24 h after the last dose of saline or Corydalis decumbens. A specific and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method was validated for the determination of five substrates and their metabolites in control group and XTW group. Our results indicated that Corydalis decumbens could have inductive effects of CYP2C19 and inhibit the activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. However, Corydalis decumbens had no significant influence on CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. The herb-drug interaction should require more attention by careful monitoring and appropriate drug dosing adjustments to the concurrent use of western medications which were metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 in human-Corydalis decumbens, Cytochrome P450, Cocktail, Pharmacokinetics, herb-drug interactions.

30645580|t|Combined proteomic and metabolomic analyses of cerebrospinal fluid from mice with ischemic stroke reveals the effects of a Buyang Huanwu decoction in neurodegenerative disease.
30645580|a|Ischemic stroke is one of the most common causes of death worldwide and is a major cause of acquired disability in adults. However, there is still a need for an effective drug for its treatment. Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription, has long been used clinically to aid neurological recovery after stroke. To establish potential clinical indicators of BHD efficacy in stroke treatment and prognosis, we conducted a combined proteomic and metabolomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples in a mouse stroke model. CSF samples were obtained from male mice with acute ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (CI/R) injury, some of which were then treated with BHD. Label-free quantitative proteomics was conducted using nano-LC-MS/MS on an LTQ Orbitrap mass and metabolomic analysis was performed using nanoprobe NMR and UHPLC-QTOF-MS. The results showed that several proteins and metabolites were present at significantly different concentrations in the CSF samples from mice with CI/R alone and those treated with BHD. These belonged to pathways related to energy demand, inflammatory signaling, cytoskeletal regulation, Wnt signaling, and neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, our in silico data suggest that BHD treatment is not only protective but can also ameliorate defects in pathways affected by neurological disorders. These data shed light on the mechanism whereby BHD may be effective in the treatment and prevention of stroke-related neurodegenerative disease.

30672261|t|[CHENG Dan-an's experience and practice in treatment of stroke].
30672261|a|CHENG Dan-an is the famous acupuncture scholar in modern times and he emphasizes the importance of moxibustion in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke. According to the different stages and types of stroke, the full-period moxibustion treatment is dominant, i.e. the moxibustion therapy for pacifying yang is used for stroke prevention, the moxibustion therapy for rescuing yang is for the emergency and the moxibustion therapy for warming and promoting meridian circulation is for the rehabilitation. Moxibustion is applicable in the full-period treatment of stroke. The corresponding treatment regimen and manipulation should be selected in terms of the individual stage and type of stroke.

30687092|t|Storax Protected Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation Induced Primary Astrocyte Injury by Inhibiting NF-κB Activation in vitro.
30687092|a|Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term disability in the world. There is an urgent unmet need to develop a range of neuroprotective strategies to restrain the damage that occurs in the hours and days following a stroke. Storax, a natural resin extracted from injuring Liquidambar orientalis Mill, has been used to treat acute stroke in traditional Chinese medicine for many centuries. Storax has demonstrated the neuroprotective effects in cerebrovascular diseases. However, the neuroprotective mechanisms activated by storax in ischemia/reperfusion-injured astrocytes have not been elucidated. In this study, we established an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced astrocytes injury model to investigate the effects of storax on OGD/R-induced astrocytes injury and potential mechanisms. Experimental results showed that storax alleviated expression of inflammatory cytokines and protected primary cortical astrocytes injured by OGD/R. Furthermore, storax could inhibit NF-κB activation in injured astrocytes by OGD/R and inhibition of NF-κB with Bay-11-7082 obscured the neuroprotective effects of storax. In conclusion, storax alleviated expression of inflammatory cytokines and protected primary cortical astrocytes injured by OGD/R, which was partially mediated by NF-κB signaling pathway activation.

30218809|t|Bu Yang Huan Wu decoction prevents reperfusion injury following ischemic stroke in rats via inhibition of HIF-1 α, VEGF and promotion β-ENaC expression.
30218809|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction (BYHW) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula used in China for the treatment of cerebral ischemic stroke. But the protective effects and underlining mechanisms of BYHW remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was designed to investigate the protective effects and underlining signaling mechanisms of BYHW on brain tissues in a rat model of cerebral ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liquid chromatography was used to verify the composition of BYHW. The cerebral edema and infarct volume were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The morphology and ultrastructure of ischemic penumbra brain tissues were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The expression levels of HIF-1 α, VEGF and β-ENaC were tested using immunohistochemistry technique, western blot and quantitative PCR analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Administration of BYHW significantly decreased cerebral edema, rat neurological function scores, reduced brain infarct volume. At the same time, BYHW had protective effect on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which improved the morphology and ultrastructure of ischemic penumbra brain tissues. BYHW treatment significantly decreased the protein and mRNA levels of HIF-1 α and VEGF compared with the model treatment. In addition, BYHW treatment significantly up-regulated the protein and mRNA levels of β-ENaC. CONCLUSIONS: BYHW protected against cerebral I/R injury in MCAO rats through inhibiting the activation of the HIF-1 α /VEGF pathway and stabilizing ion channel of β-ENaC in brain, indicating that BYHW shows potential for stroke treatment in acute stage.

30611281|t|The gender- and age- dependent relationships between serum lipids and cognitive impairment: a cross-sectional study in a rural area of Xi'an, China.
30611281|a|BACKGROUND: Serum lipids [total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG)] are risk factors for stroke, but the relationships between serum lipids and cognitive impairment have not been verified completely. In this study, we studied the relationships between serum lipids and cognitive impairment and explored whether gender and age had effects on the relationships. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we collected serum lipids and cognitive function information from 1762 participants (aged 40-85). Univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and both gender- and age-based stratified multivariate analysis were used. RESULTS: In the entire sample set, there was no significant correlation between serum lipid parameters (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG) and cognitive impairment. In both gender- and age-based stratified multivariate analysis, high serum TC was positively associated with cognitive impairment in the elderly (> 55) male participants (OR = 4.404, 95% CI = 1.264-15.344, p = 0.02), and high serum LDL-C was positively correlated with cognitive impairment in the elderly female subjects (OR = 2.496, 95% CI = 1.057-5.896, p = 0.037), while high serum TG was negatively associated with cognitive impairment in the middle-aged (≤ 55) male participants (OR = 0.157, 95% CI = 0.051-0.484, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between serum lipids and cognitive impairment are gender- and age- dependent, with high serum TC and LDL-C may be risk factors of cognitive impairment in the elderly male and female subjects respectively, while high serum TG may be protector of cognitive impairment in the middle-aged male participants.

30362349|t|Metabolomic Profiling Reveals That Reprogramming of Cerebral Glucose Metabolism Is Involved in Ischemic Preconditioning-Induced Neuroprotection in a Rodent Model of Ischemic Stroke.
30362349|a|Ischemic tolerance renders the brain resistant to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury as a result of the activation of endogenous adaptive responses triggered by various types of preconditioning. The complex underlying metabolic mechanisms responsible for the neuroprotection of cerebral ischemic preconditioning (IPC) remain elusive. Herein, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique was applied to delineate the dynamic changes of brain metabolome in a rodent model of ischemic stroke (transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, tMCAO), alone or after pretreatment with nonlethal ischemic tolerance induction (transient occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries, tBCCAO). Metabolomic analysis showed that accumulation of glucose (concentration increased more than 4 fold) and glycolytic intermediates is the prominent feature of brain I/R-induced metabolic disturbance. IPC attenuated brain I/R damage by subduing postischemic hyperglycolysis, increasing the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux and promoting the utilization of β-hydroxybutyrate. The expression analysis of pivotal genes and proteins involved in relevant metabolic pathways revealed that the downregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3) and reduced mRNA levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) subunits were associated with IPC-induced metabolic flexibility, which allows the brain to be more capable of withstanding severe I/R insults. The present study provided mechanistic insights into the metabolic signature of IPC and indicated that adaptively modulating brain glucose metabolism could be an effective approach for the therapeutic intervention of ischemic stroke.

30719060|t|Acupuncture Enhances Communication between Cortices with Damaged White Matters in Poststroke Motor Impairment.
30719060|a|Stroke is a leading cause of motor disability. Acupuncture is an effective therapeutic strategy for poststroke motor impairment. However, its mechanism is still elusive. Twenty-two stroke patients having a right-hemispheric subcortical infarct and 22 matched healthy controls were recruited to undergo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. The resting-state fMRI was implemented before and after needling at GB34 (Yanglingquan). The stroke patients presented a substantially reduced fractional anisotropy value in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum. The structural integrity of the frontoparietal part of the SLF (SLF-FP) correlated with the motor scores of lower limbs in stroke patients. This corticocortical association bundle originated from the premotor cortex (PM) and the adjacent supplementary motor area (SMA), known as secondary motor areas, and terminated in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG). After acupuncture intervention, the corresponding functional connectivity between the PM/SMA and SMG was enhanced in stroke patients compared with healthy controls. These findings suggested that the integrity of the SLF is a potential neuroimaging biomarker for motor disability of lower limbs following a stroke. Acupuncture could increase the communication between the cortices connected by the impaired white matter tracts, implying the neural mechanism underlying the acupuncture intervention.

31505937|t|Application of Chinese Medicine in Acute and Critical Medical Conditions.
31505937|a|Western medicine is routinely used in developed nations as well as in Eastern countries, where traditional medicine is frequently used by a selection of patients or family member as a complement to mainstream Western medicine. Chinese medicine plays an important role in the treatment of chronic diseases, especially when Western medicine is not very effective. Many published reports have shown that Chinese medicine could also be successfully used in the management of acute and critical illnesses. Chinese medicine has a holistic view of the human body, and emphasizes individualization based on body balance and mind-body interaction and employs herbal medicines and acupuncture. This review paper gives a brief overview of Chinese medicine theory and therapeutic modality and then addresses the application of Chinese medicine in the treatment of acute and critical medical conditions, including epidemics. Using this ancient therapy as a complementary medicine, the management of serious medical conditions, such as SARS, acute heart diseases, and ischemic cerebral stroke, are presented. In order to promote more widespread application of Chinese medicine, well-designed controlled clinical trials are urgently needed to prove its safety and effectiveness.

30814086|t|Significant Association of Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 Promoter Hypomethylation with Stroke in a Chinese Population with Primary Hypertension.
30814086|a|OBJECTIVE: Hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia are both stroke risk factors. Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1) plays a vital role in one-carbon metabolism via encoding a protein with three distinct enzymatic activities (methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, and formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase). We aimed to elucidate the association between MTHFD1 promoter methylation and stroke in a Chinese population with primary hypertension. METHODS: Quantitative methylation-specific PCR was used to quantify MTHFD1 methylation levels in 243 hypertensive controls and 138 matched patients with stroke (also with primary hypertension). A luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to investigate the possible regulatory function of the MTHFD1 promoter. RESULTS: Methylation of the MTHFD1 promoter was significantly higher in hypertensive controls than in patients with stroke (median [interquartile range]: 10.16[6.61-14.00] vs. 5.41[3.15-7.53], P<0.001). The median level of homocysteine (Hcy) was 15.50 μmol/L in patients with stroke, which was higher than the (homocysteine) Hcy level of 14.40 μmol/L in the hypertensive controls (P=0.010). The diagnostic value of MTHFD1 methylation for stroke was also examined. The area under the curve was 0.789(0.743-0.836), and the sensitivity and specificity were 79.7% and 67.1%, respectively. A significant inverse correlation was observed between MTHFD1 methylation level and Hcy (rs =-0.110, P=0.031). Subsequently, a significant gene regulatory function of the MTHFD1 promoter was discovered using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a significant association between hypomethylation of the MTHFD1 promoter and stroke in Chinese hypertensive populations.

30399590|t|NK cells in cerebral ischemia.
30399590|a|As a vital cell type in immune system and infiltrating cells in ischemic brain, NK cells can bridge the crosstalk between immune system and nervous system in stroke setting. The mechanism of action of NK cells is complicated, involving direct and indirect actions. NK cells are closely associated with poststroke inflammation, immunodepression and infections. The excessive inflammatory response in ischemic brain is one of the important causes for aggravating cerebral ischemic injury. Besides the inflammation induced by ischemia itself, thrombolytic drug tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration could also induce deteriorative inflammation, which is unfavorable for stroke control and recovery. Regulating NK cells may has the potential to modulate the immune response, limiting the development of ischemic damage and getting better outcome. In addition, post-stroke immunosuppression may lead to infections which contribute to higher severity and mortality of ischemic stroke (IS). Targeting NK cells may help to find novel pathways for IS therapy, which can both ameliorate the infarction itself, but also reduce the infectious complications. NK cells may also link IS and related diseases, suggesting NK cells can be used as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for IS prevention and treatment.

30448453|t|New progress in the approaches for blood-brain barrier protection in acute ischemic stroke.
30448453|a|Ischemic stroke is a disease with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, which often places an additional strain on families and society due to the poor prognosis. Blood brain-barrier (BBB) damage is the critical pathological process, which contributes to hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and poor prognosis in cerebral ischemia. Thus, there is a pressing need to seek an approach to ameliorate BBB damage and reduce the HT that can be induced by fibrinolytic therapy involving recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in clinical practice. This review provides an overview of the recent scientific reports to improve our understanding of new approaches to ameliorating BBB damage in ischemic stroke, including physical approaches, chemical agents, traditional Chinese medicine and its extracts, neural stem cell therapy and microRNA intervention. Inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is possibly the main functional mechanism of these BBB protectants, along with anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Other significant mechanisms for BBB protection have been studied recently, such as anti-apoptosis, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ Akt pathways and so on. An in-depth understanding of the related mechanisms contributes to finding potential approaches for BBB protection, and a deeper understanding of the emerging BBB protectants offers opportunities to seek a promising adjuvant therapy to prevent HT in the post-stroke brain.

31544716|t|Prediction Model of Early Return to Hospital after Discharge Following Acute Ischemic Stroke.
31544716|a|BACKGROUND: Reducing hospital readmissions for stroke remains a significant challenge to improve outcomes and decrease healthcare costs. METHODS: We analyzed 10,034 adult patients with ischemic stroke, presented within 24 hours of onset from a hospital-based stroke registry. The risk factors for early return to hospital after discharge were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses. RESULTS: Among the study population, 277 (2.8%) had 3-day Emergency Department (ED) reattendance, 534 (5.3%) had 14-day readmission, and 932 (9.3%) had 30-day readmission. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that age, nasogastric tube feeding, indwelling urinary catheter, healthcare utilization behaviour, and stroke severity were major and common risk factors for an early return to the hospital after discharge. CART analysis identified nasogastric tube feeding and length of stay for 72-hour ED reattendance, Barthel Index (BI) score, total length of stay in the Year Preceding the index admission (YLOS), indwelling urinary catheter, and age for 14-day readmission, and nasogastric tube feeding, BI score, YLOS, and number of inpatient visits in the year preceding the index admission for 30-day readmission as important factors to classify the patients into subgroups. CONCLUSION: Although CART analysis did not improve the prediction of an early return to the hospital after stroke compared with logistic regression models, decision rules generated by CART can easily be interpreted and applied in clinical practice.

30977448|t|Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage is Associated with Mortality after Acute Ischemic Stroke.
30977448|a|OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is serious during the acute phase and is reported to be related to an increased risk of death during the acute phase of acute ischemic stroke in particular. Our study was designed to investigate the relationship between GI hemorrhage and the mortality of acute ischemic stroke, assessing the influence of cerebrovascular risk factors, brain herniation and oral anticoagulation on the onset of GI hemorrhage. The identified risk factors for the occurrence of GI hemorrhage help to elucidate their respective roles in the mortality of acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: A total of 15993 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke, including 216 cases and 15777 controls, were enrolled in the study from October 2010 to December 2018. Basic clinical and examination data were collected at the time of study enrollment. GI hemorrhage was diagnosed according to the presence of clinical features and endoscopy. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regressions were conducted to explore the associations between the GI hemorrhage occurrence and known risk factors. Kaplan-Meier was used to assess the influence of GI hemorrhage on the age of mortality of acute ischemic stroke. RESULTS: GI hemorrhage cases among patients with acute ischemic stroke accounted for 1.35%. Male patients with ischemic stroke were more likely to have GI hemorrhage than their female counterparts (odds ratio (OR): 1.79; P = 0.000). Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) had a higher incidence of GI hemorrhage than their counterparts without AF (3.03% vs. 1.20%; P < 0.05). Use of oral anticoagulants was related to increased risk for GI hemorrhage (OR: 1.96; P = 0.00). After adjusting for age and sex, both AF and oral anticoagulant use maintained associations with increased risk for GI hemorrhage (2.59-times and 2.02-times risk respectively; P = 0.00). Patients with hyperlipidemia had a lower incidence of GI hemorrhage than their counterparts without hyperlipidemia (0.62% vs. 1.60%; P < 0.05). Hyperlipidemia was associated with a reduced risk of GI hemorrhage (OR: 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.58; P = 0.00), even after adjusting for age and sex (OR: 0.41; P = 0.00). Patients with brain herniation had a 6.54-times increased risk for GI hemorrhage (P = 0.00). GI hemorrhage was associated with 10.98-fold risk for mortality of acute ischemic stroke (P = 0.00). There was an interaction between GI hemorrhage and brain herniation and increased 26.91-fold risk for the mortality after acute ischemic stroke (P = 0.00). CONCLUSION: AF, oral anticoagulant use, brain herniation and male sex increase GI hemorrhage risk, while hyperlipidemia reduces risk. GI hemorrhage itself increases the risk for mortality of acute ischemic stroke. The interaction between GI hemorrhage and brain herniation increased the risk for the mortality after acute ischemic stroke.

30977445|t|Prognostic Significance of Serum Magnesium in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage Patients.
30977445|a|BACKGROUND: Experimental animal model studies have shown neuroprotective properties of magnesium. We assessed the relationship between admission magnesium and admission stroke severity and 3-month clinical outcomes in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS: The present study included 323 patients with acute ICH who were prospectively identified. Demographic characteristics, lifestyle risk factors, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, hematoma volumes, and other clinical features were recorded at baseline for all participants. Patients were divided into three groups based on the admission magnesium levels (T1: <0.84; T2: 0.84-0.91; T3: ≥0.91 mmol/L). Clinical outcomes were death, poor functional outcome (defined by modified rankin ccale [mRS] scores 3-6) at 3 months. RESULTS: After 3-month follow-up, 40 (12.4%) all-cause mortality and 132 (40.9%) poor functional outcome were documented. Median NIHSS scores for each tertile (T1 to T3) were 8.0, 5.5, and 6.0, and median hematoma volumes were 10.0, 8.05, and 12.4 ml, respectively. There was no significant association between baseline NIHSS scores (P=0.176) and hematoma volumes (P=0.442) in T3 and T1 in multivariable linear regression models. Compared with the patients in T1, those in T3 were associated with less frequency of all-cause mortality [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.02-0.54; P-trend=0.010] but not poor functional outcome (adjusted OR, 1.80; 95%CI, 0.71-4.56; P-trend=0.227) after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Elevated admission serum magnesium level is associated with lower odds of mortality but not poor functional outcome at 3 months in patients with acute ICH.

31661693|t|The Effectiveness of Action Observation Therapy Based on Mirror Neuron Theory in Chinese Patients with Apraxia of Speech after Stroke.
31661693|a|OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of action observation therapy (AOT) on apraxia of speech (AOS) in patients after stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients diagnosed with AOS after stroke were randomly divided into an experimental group (n = 21) and a control group (n = 21). Both groups received 30 min of conventional language therapy twice daily, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The patients in the experimental group additionally received 20 min of AOT before 10 min language therapy each day. The speech function and aphasia severity of the 2 groups were assessed using the speech apraxia assessment method of the China Rehabilitation Research Center, Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), and the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination before and after treatment. RESULTS: AOS and WAB scores increased significantly after treatment in both groups (p < 0.05). AOS and WAB scores exhibited significant differences between the experimental group and the control group after training (p < 0.05). The response rate in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: AOT based on mirror neuron theory may improve language function in patients with AOS after stroke.

31013499|t|Effects of Acupuncture Treatment on Lower Limb Spasticity in Patients Following Hemorrhagic Stroke: A Pilot Study.
31013499|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lower limb spasticity is often a significant problem in stoke rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of acupuncture treatment on lower limb spasticity in patients following hemorrhagic stroke. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients following hemorrhagic stroke were randomized to receive acupuncture treatment combined with conventional treatment (treatment group [TG]) or conventional treatment only (control group [CG]). Acupuncture treatments were given in 24 sessions over 4 weeks. Blinded evaluation was based on Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), short intracortical inhibition (SICI), and Hmax/Mmax ratio as the primary outcomes. In addition, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Barthel Index (BI), motor evoked potential (MEP) and surface integrated electromyogram (IEMG) were employed as the secondary outcomes. All the evaluations were performed at 14 and 28 days after the start of the treatment. RESULTS: Compared with the CG, the TG showed a significantly greater over-time decrease in MAS for knee (p = 0.022) and ankle (p = 0.017), SICI (p = 0.000) and Hmax/Mmax ratio (p = 0.000). In all patients of TG, we found a greater improvement in lower-limb FMA and MEP but not in BI. IEMG show that TG obtained a greater reduction in spastic agonist muscles and a greater enhancement in spastic antagonist muscles. A significant correlation between a greater decrease in ankle MAS and a greater increase in SICI for spastic muscles was found (r = 0.390, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture could improve the lower limb spasticity and motor function, thus providing a safe and economical approach for treating stroke patients. The potential mechanism underpinning the greater improvement may be attributed to a reshape of corticospinal plasticity induced by acupuncture.

30657576|t|DCA can improve the ACI-induced neurological impairment through negative regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway.
30657576|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) on neurological impairment induced by acute cerebral infarction (ACI) and its relevant mechanism of action. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 60 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into Sham group (n = 20), ACI group (n = 20), and TUDCA group (n = 20). The rat model of ACI in middle cerebral artery was established. TUDCA was intravenously injected into rats in the TUDCA group, while an equal amount of sodium bicarbonate solution was intravenously injected into the other two groups. The blood was drawn after modeling to detect the content of serum glutamate (Glu), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The degree of cerebral infarction in each experimental group was observed under an optical microscope, and the infarct area was measured and compared. The content of serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was detected via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); mRNA and protein expressions of them were detected using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively, followed by statistical analysis. Moreover, the expression levels of serum malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were detected, followed by statistical analysis. The protein expressions of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax), and caspase-3 were detected via Western blotting, and the gray value was determined, followed by statistical analysis. RESULTS: TUDCA could improve the symptoms of neurological impairment in ACI patients, decrease the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score but increase the activity of daily living (ADL) score of patients, and significantly reduce the content of serum TG, TC, and LDL-C, showing statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). TUDCA significantly decreased the serum Glu content in ACI rats, reduced the cerebral infarction area and lowered the serum TG, TC, and LDL-C content, displaying statistically significant differences (p < 0 .05). Besides, TUDCA inhibited mRNA and protein expressions of TNF-α, IL-8, and hs-CRP, and alleviated the inflammatory response. TUDCA inhibited MDA and ox-LDL expressions, but increased SOD and GPX expressions, and relieved oxidative stress injury. In addition, TUDCA could negatively regulate Nrf2 signaling pathway, and down-regulated VLDLR and NF-κB protein expressions and expressions of apoptotic proteins (Bax and caspase-3). CONCLUSIONS: TUDCA can alleviate the ACI-induced neurological impairment in rats through mitigating lipid peroxidation and inflammatory response and reducing apoptosis, whose relevant mechanism may be that TUDCA negatively regulates Nrf2 signaling pathway.

30713571|t|Water Extract of Acori Graminei Rhizoma Attenuates Features of Rheumatoid Arthritis in DBA/1 Mice.
30713571|a|The dry rhizome of Acorus gramineus Solander, known as Acori Graminei Rhizoma, is used to treat dementia, stroke, eczema, and indigestion in traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Korean medicine, and traditional Japanese Kampo medicine. Previous studies have reported that Acori Graminei Rhizoma extract ameliorated cognitive impairment in Aβ1-42 injected mice. However, the effect of Acori Graminei Rhizoma on type II collagen induced arthritis (CIA) has not been elucidated. Thus, we evaluated the water extract of Acori Graminei Rhizoma (WAG) in CIA mice models. Male DBA/1 mice were separated into five groups (NOR; n=10, CON; n=10, CIA + methotrexate (MTX); n=10, CIA + 100 mg/kg WAG; n=10, CIA + 500 mg/kg WAG; n=10). CIA was induced by injecting the mice with bovine type II collagen, after which the mice were treated with WAG and/or MTX. Hematological parameters and liver and kidney serum toxicity markers were analyzed. Further, serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-α, and type II collagen IgG were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Treatment with 500 mg/kg WAG decreased serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and collagen IgG in a CIA model. Moreover, WAG treatment decreased CIA-induced swelling of mouse hind legs, infiltration of inflammatory cells into the synovial membrane, and blood neutrophil levels. WAG administration did not influence hematological parameters or kidneys and liver toxicity markers. WAG may be used to treat arthritis by reducing the inflammation indicators. However, further experiments are required to determine how WAG affects inflammation mechanisms in vitro and in vivo.

30315933|t|The multiple protective roles and molecular mechanisms of melatonin and its precursor N-acetylserotonin in targeting brain injury and liver damage and in maintaining bone health.
30315933|a|Melatonin is a neurohormone associated with sleep and wakefulness and is mainly produced by the pineal gland. Numerous physiological functions of melatonin have been demonstrated including anti-inflammation, suppressing neoplastic growth, circadian and endocrine rhythm regulation, and its potent antioxidant activity as well as its role in regeneration of various tissues including the nervous system, liver, bone, kidney, bladder, skin, and muscle, among others. In this review, we summarize the recent advances related to the multiple protective roles of melatonin receptor agonists, melatonin and N-acetylserotonin (NAS), in brain injury, liver damage, and bone health. Brain injury, including traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and newborn perinatal hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy, is a major cause of mortality and disability. Liver disease causes serious public health problems and various factors including alcohol, chemical pollutants, and drugs induce hepatic damage. Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease in humans. Due in part to an aging population, both the cost of care of fracture patients and the annual fracture rate have increased steadily. Despite the discrepancy in the pathophysiological processes of these disorders, time frames and severity, they may share several common molecular mechanisms. Oxidative stress is considered to be a critical factor in these pathogeneses. We update the current state of knowledge related to the molecular processes, mainly including anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, autophagy dysfunction, and anti-inflammation as well as other properties of melatonin and NAS. Particularly, the abilities of melatonin and NAS to directly scavenge oxygen-centered radicals and toxic reactive oxygen species, and indirectly act through antioxidant enzymes are disscussed. In this review, we summarize the similarities and differences in the protection provided by melatonin and/or NAS in brain, liver and bone damage. We analyze the involvement of melatonin receptor 1A (MT1), melatonin receptor 1B (MT2), and melatonin receptor 1C (MT3) in the protection of melatonin and/or NAS. Additionally, we evaluate their potential clinical applications. The multiple mechanisms of action and multiple organ-targeted properties of melatonin and NAS may contribute to development of promising therapies for clinical trials.

30386989|t|Icariin ameliorates angiotensin II-induced cerebrovascular remodeling by inhibiting Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase activation.
30386989|a|Cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) hyperplasia is an important contributor to cerebrovascular remodeling during hypertension. The aim of present study was to investigate the effects of Icariin on cerebrovascular SMCs proliferation and remodeling and the underlying mechanisms. The results revealed that Icariin administration attenuated the enhanced basilar artery constriction in angiotensin II (AngII)-induced hypertension rat model, as well as the inhibition of basilar artery diameter reduction in response to AngII and phenylephrine. In addition, histological analyses showed that Icariin also significantly ameliorated basilar artery remodeling in AngII hypertensive rats. In human brain vascular SMCs (HBVSMCs), AngII-induced cell proliferation, migration and invasion were markedly inhibited by Icariin treatment. Moreover, Icariin treatment largely limited AngII-induced the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HBVSMCs, which was closely associated with cell proliferation. Analysis of the mechanisms showed that Icariin decreased ROS production via inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity but not mitochondria-derived ROS production. Further, Icariin promoted Nox2 degradation and consequently reduced its protein expression. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that Icariin attenuates cerebrovascular SMCs hyperplasia and subsequent remodeling through inhibiting Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase activation, suggesting Icariin may be a potential therapeutic agent to prevent the onset and progression of stroke.

30342128|t|Pharmacological effects of natural Ganoderma and its extracts on neurological diseases: A comprehensive review.
30342128|a|Ganoderma, has been used for clinical applications for thousands of years as a highly-nutritious and significantly-effective medicinal herb. The active components and efficacy of Ganoderma are constantly being explored and supplemented every year. In recent years, more and more literature has reported the pharmacological effects of Ganoderma on anti-tumor, liver protection and immunity enhancement, especially on neuroprotection. Numerous research works on the neuroprotective effects of Ganoderma have been documented (e.g., modulation of neurogenesis, amelioration of Alzheimer's disease, therapeutic effect on epilepsy, the protective effect on neural cells in stroke injury, etc.) thus it has drawn increasing attention. However, an integrated and comprehensive review of recent research findings has not been detailed in any great depth. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize and elucidate recent progress of neuroprotective effects of natural Ganoderma and its extracts.

30431067|t|'Governor vessel-unblocking and mind-regulating' acupuncture therapy ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion.
30431067|a|Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicinal therapy, which is used for the amelioration of cognitive dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and relevancy mechanisms of 'governor vessel‑unblocking and mind‑regulating' acupuncture therapy for cognitive dysfunction in rats with ischemia. For this purpose, we used the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method to induce cognitive dysfunction in rats. The behavioral changes in the rats were examined using the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The effects of the treatment on oxidative stress response and the function of the mitochondria in brain tissues were also assessed. The results revealed that 'governor vessel‑unblocking and mind‑regulating' acupuncture therapy markedly improved the cognitive ability of the rats with cognitive dysfunction. The production of pro‑oxidative stress factors, including nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), was also blocked along with the amelioration of cognitive function, while the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cyclooxygenase (COX) was restored. At the molecular level, the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the mitochondria was suppressed by 'governor vessel‑unblocking and mind‑regulating' acupuncture therapy, which may be attributed to the inhibition of the function of translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40) and translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 17A (TIMM17A). On the whole, the findings of the present study confirm the effects of 'governor vessel‑unblocking and mind‑regulating' acupuncture therapy on cognitive dysfunction induced by brain ischemia in rats, and that the mechanisms underlying the effects of this treatment might be mediated through the inhibition of TOMM40 and TIMM17A synthesis, which can relieve mitochondrial dysfunction from the accumulation of Aβ.

31156178|t|Immortalized Human Bone Marrow Derived Stromal Cells in Treatment of Transient Cerebral Ischemia in Rats.
31156178|a|Cerebral ischemic stroke may cause a number of adverse neurological complications or behavioral disorders. Moreover, cerebral ischemic stroke is a prevalent disease with limited treatment strategies and may increase chances of developing neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's disease, in the future. Therefore, alternative strategies are highly needed for improving the therapy for ischemic stroke. Human bone marrow stroma stem cells, also known as mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), have a demonstrative role in treating transient cerebral ischemia, yet whether immortalized hMSC may have a better effect than hMSC is unknown. Here, we addressed this question. A rat cerebral ischemia reperfusion (IR) model was used to compare the effects of hMSC and an immortalized hMSC by human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hMSC-TERT). We found that both hMSC and hMSC-TERT similarly attenuated the elevation of serum neuron specific enolase levels after IR. Transplantation with hMSC alleviated cerebral infarction, alleviated brain edema, improved neural function, and reduced brain cell apoptosis, in a significantly better degree than transplantation with hMSC. Thus, these data suggest that immortalized hMSC may have an advantage over hMSC in treatment of transient cerebral ischemia.

29660382|t|Elevated plasma soluble (pro)renin receptor levels are associated with left ventricular remodeling and renal function in chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction.
29660382|a|Soluble (pro)renin receptor [s(P)RR], which is generated from cleavage of (P)RR, can be detected in plasma and urine. s(P)RR levels can reflect the severity of some diseases, such as renal lesions, gestational diabetes mellitus or hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. However, the relationship between s(P)RR levels and the severity of chronic heart failure remains undetermined. We studied s(P)RR levels in 118 patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), including 86 without renal dysfunction (HF) and 32 with renal dysfunction (HF + RF), and 28 healthy subjects (HS) to reveal the relationship between s(P)RR levels and other HFrEF parameters. Plasma s(P)RR levels were 22.2 ± 4.1 ng/mL (HS), 26.4 ± 5.3 ng/ mL (HF) and 30.0 ± 5.3 ng/mL (HF + RF). Plasma s(P)RR levels were significantly higher in the HF group than in the HS group (P < 0.001) and even more increased in the HF + RF group (P < 0.001 vs. the HS group and P < 0.05 vs. the HF group). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were independently related to s(P)RR levels in HFrEF patients. In conclusion, high plasma s(P)RR levels are associated with left ventricular remodeling and, especially, with renal dysfunction. Therefore, s(P)RR is a promising evaluative indicator for the severity of HFrEF patients.

31282440|t|Danhong injection facilitates recovery of post-stroke motion deficit via Parkin-enhanced mitochondrial function.
31282440|a|BACKGROUND: A cerebral ischemic stroke involves mitochondrial dysfunction, motor deficits, and paralysis; and Danhong injection (DHI) might possess mitochondrial protection and functional recovery in a stroke subject through promoting expression of parkin, a ubiquitin ligase playing a key role in the regulation of proteins and mitochondria quality control. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effects of DHI on the histological, cellular, and functional recovery of Wistar rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R). METHODS: One hundred and twenty healthy male Wistar rats (250-300 g), were randomly assigned to six groups (twenty rats/group). Rats were subjected to 1 h MCAO/R and subsequently administered the intravenous doses of DHI (0.75, 1.5, and 3 mL/kg) to the respective groups (twice a day for 14 days). Unlike the other groups, the sham group received surgery without vessel occlusion. All the animals were tested for gait behavior using the CatWalk system. The body weight/survival rates were recorded daily for 14 days. The parkin protein expression of the brain tissue was quantified by immunohistochemistry analysis. Additionally, cultured cortical neurons were incubation with DHI or minocycline (MC) and then deprived of oxygen and glucose for 2 h (to resemble ischemic/reperfusion), followed by 4 h reoxygenation. Cellular and mitochondrial phenotypes were assayed by high content analysis. RESULTS: Neurological integrity and paw parameters of the animals were altered in the model group but significantly ameliorated by DHI administration. Also, the infarct volume and survival rate were significantly improved in DHI groups. DHI enhanced the expression of parkin protein in the brain and improved the relative mitochondrial reductase activity of the cultured neurons. CONCLUSIONS: The overall result shows that daily intervention with DHI provides neuroprotection and survival to improve gait motion in Wistar rats.

31045554|t|A TCM acupoints ranking approach towards post-stroke dysphagia based on an improved MCTS decision method.
31045554|a|Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) multiple-acupoints stimulation is widely used to improve dysphagia among post-stroke patients. However, prior research in evidence-based acupuncture mostly focused on the treatment effects of single acupoint's on dysphagia, while the evidence of optimal sequence of multiple-acupoints stimulation remains limited. In this paper, we developed an evaluation method of hybrid knowledge (deterministic knowledge and the experiential group decision knowledge) sequences based on segmentation mechanism of sub-sequence fragments, and then, we proposed a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) sequential decision-making method under the hybrid knowledge. Thereafter, we applied this proposed sequential decision-making approach to optimizing sequential decision-making schema of multiple-acupoints stimulation, to treat dysphagia among post-stroke patients. Finally, we verified the validity and the feasibility of this method by comparing it to other sequential decision-making search methods.

31532140|a|Ischemic stroke is a major cause of permanent disability and death in adults, and electroacupuncture (EA) intervention has a positive role in improving neurological function in patients with ischemic stroke through a series of complex processes. In the present paper, we make a review about the development of researches on the involvement of micro-ribonucleic acid (miRNA) in ischemic stroke from excitatory amino acid toxicity, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, apoptosis and necrosis, and particularly sum up outcomes of researches about the roles of miRNAs in EA-induced improvement of neurological function in experimental cerebral ischemia animals. EA treatment can 1) balance levels of miRNAs (such as mir-126 and mir-328, etc.) to promote angiogenesis of ischemic cerebral cortex tissue by regulating expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family genes and proteins; 2) promote nerve regeneration by up-regulating serum miR-124 and hippocampal miR-132 expression to possibly facilitate cerebral repair and reduce cognitive dysfunction respectively via related proteins; 3) reduce cerebral edema via modulating expression of some miRNAs to control expression of aquaporin, matrix metalloproteinases, etc. and 4) suppress inflammatory response via up-regulating expression of miRNAs to inhibit expression of NF-κB, TNF-α, etc. in the local cerebral tissue. As a result, the neurological function is bettered after EA intervention.

31532136|t|[Effect of "Tongyuan" acupuncture treatment on success rate of extubation in stroke patients undergoing tracheotomy].
31532136|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the impact of "Tongyuan" (regulating the Governor Vessel to tranquilize mental activities, conducting qi back to its origin) acupuncture treatment on cough reflex, pulmonary infection and swallowing function in stroke patients undergoing tracheotomy. METHODS: Seventy-four cerebral stroke patients with tracheo-tomy were randomly allocated to scalp acupuncture and "Tongyuan" acupuncture groups (n=37 in each group). All the patients of the two groups received basic treatment, including treatment of primary diseases, routine nursing, respiratory muscle training, physical therapy, acupuncture of Chize (LU5), Quchi (LI11), Hegu (LI4), Weizhong (BL40), Zusanli (ST36). In addition, for patients of the scalp acupuncture group, the middle 2/5 of Dingnieqianxiexian (MS6), the middle 2/5 of Dingniehouxiexian (MS7) and Dingpangerxian (MS9) on the contralateral side of lesions were punctured with filiform needles. For patients of the "Tongyuan" acupuncture group, Baihui (GV20), Zhongwan (GV12), Guanyuan (CV4), Qihai (CV6), Tianshu (ST25), Feishu (BL13), Pishu (BL20) were needled. The treatment in both groups lasted 30 minutes each time, once daily, 6 times a week for 4 weeks. The cough reflex grading score (CRGS, assessed according to cough, independent expectoration, sputum suction), clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS, assessed according to the body temperature, white blood cell count, airway secretion in 24 h, PaO2/FiO2, infiltration status, cultured pathogenic bacteria), and swallowing function were evaluated by a researcher who was blinded to the grouping and treatment procedures. The success rate of extubation was calculated in a week at the end of treatments. RESULTS: After the treatment, the CRGS and CPIS of both groups were apparently decreased in comparison with their own pre-treatment (P<0.05), suggesting an improvement of the cough reflex and pulmonary infection. Regarding the swallowing function, of the two 37 cases in the scalp acupuncture and "Tongyuan" acupuncture groups, 9(24.3%) and 19(51.4%) experienced marked improvement, 12(32.5%)and 14(37.8%) were effective, and 16(43.2%) and 4(10.8%)failed in the treatment, with the effective rate being 56.8% and 89.2%, respectively. In regard to the successful extubation, of the two 37 cases in the scalp acupuncture and "Tongyuan" acupuncture groups, 5(13.5%) and 11(29.8%)had a marked improvement, 10(27.0%)and 18(48.6%)were effective, and 22(59.5%)and 8(21.6%)failed, with the effective rate being 40.5% and 78.4%, respectively. The therapeutic effect of "Tongyuan" acupuncture was significantly superior to that of scalp acupuncture in decreasing CRGS and CPIS, and in improving the swallowing function and raising the rate of successful extubation (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: "Tongyuan" acupuncture treatment can improve cough reflex to remove sputum, reduce pulmonary infection, enhance swallowing function, and raise the success rate of extubation in stroke patients, which is better than scalp acupuncture.

31532131|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of penetrative needling from "Baihui" (GV20) to "Qubin" (GB7) on neurological function and expression of autophagy related protein microtubule-associated protein, light chain 3 (LC3) in rats with hemorrhagic stroke, so as to explore its mechanism underlying improvement of hemorrhagic stroke. METHODS: A total of 120 male SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation, model, non-acupoint, acupuncture and medication (Rapamycin) groups which were further divided into two time-point subgroups (3, 7 days after modeling, n=12/subgroup). The intracerebral hemorrhage model was established by injection of the rat's auto-blood (50 μL) into the putaman region. Penetrative needling from GV20 to GB7 or sham acupoints (about 1 cm beside GV20 and GB7) was conducted for 30 min, twice daily for 7 days. For rats of the medication group, Rapamycin solution (7 μmol/L) was injected into the right lateral ventricle. The neurological functions (locomotor and balance deficits) were evaluated according to suspended wire test (0-6 points) and horizontal board walking test (0-6 points). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expression of total LC3 and expression of LC3-Ⅰ and LC3-Ⅱ proteins in the ischemic penumbra region of brain tissue, respectively. RESULTS: After modeling, the neurological function scores were significantly decreased on day 3 and 7, the levels of LC3-Ⅱ/Ⅰ and LC3 protein on day 3 and 7 were significantly increased in the model group relevant to the sham operation group (P<0.05). Following the interventions, the neurological function scores as well as LC3-Ⅱ/Ⅰ and LC3 protein expression were significantly increased in both acupuncture and medication groups compared with the model group (P<0.05). The effect of Rapamycin was obviously stronger than that of penetrative needling in up-regulating the expression of LC3-Ⅱ/Ⅰ and LC3 protein (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Penetrative needling can improve neurologic function in hemorrhagic stroke rats, which is related with its effect in up-regulating the expression of autophagy-related protein LC3.

30868832|t|[Regularity of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for same treatment for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases].
30868832|a|To explore the regularity of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) prescriptions for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases,the core drug groups with common therapeutic effects on cerebrovascular diseases represented by stroke and cardiovascular diseases represented by coronary artery disease were extracted,and their consistency and difference in the treatment of different diseases were analyzed.A total of 388 Chinese patent medicines were collected for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases,cardiovascular diseases and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases.The dominant and recessive patterns of Chinese patent medicines in clinical use were found by "frequency analysis","compatibility analysis" and "network analysis" respectively.According to the findings of the three parts,Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma,Chuanxiong Rhizoma,Carthami Flos and Astragali Radix have a high frequency of use in the treatment of brain disease,heart disease and both,with frequent combined medication.Data mining confirmed the core drug combinations for the treatment of cerebral and cardiac vascular diseases,so as to reveal the similarities and differences in the drug use of Chinese medicine for these diseases,and provide a basis for the rational use of traditional Chinese medicine in clinical practice.This analysis also defines a new direction for the future development of prescription combinations for different indications of cerebral and cardiac diseases.

30621565|t|Novel approaches to anti-atherosclerotic therapy: Cell-based models and herbal preparations (Review of our own data).
30621565|a|Atherosclerosis is a chronic arterial disease characterized by vascular inflammation, accumulation of lipids in the arterial wall, and formation and growth of atherosclerotic plaques followed by ischemia. In subclinical atherosclerosis, cholesterol retention in subendothelial cells leads to induction of local inflammation, generation of foam cells and lesion formation, followed by a chain of other pathogenic events. Atherosclerotic progression can frequently be fatal, since plaque rupture may lead to thrombosis and acute events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden death. Traditional anti-atherosclerotic therapy is mainly focused on improving blood lipid profile and does not target various stages of plaque progression. Obviously, treating the disease at initial stages is better than beginning treatment at advanced stages and, in that regard, current atherosclerosis management can be improved. Cholesterol retention is an important component of atherogenesis that precedes plaque formation. Therapeutic targeting of cholesterol retention may be beneficial for preventing further atherogenic progression. For this purpose, we suggest using herbal preparations due to good tolerability and suitability for long-lasting treatment. We developed test systems based on cultured human intimal aortic cells for rapid screening of potential anti-atherogenic drugs. With the help of these test systems, we selected several natural substances with significant anti-atherogenic activity and further use these compounds to prepare herbal preparations for anti-atherosclerotic therapy. These preparations were clinically tested and showed good safety and a potent anti-atherogenic potential.

31064164|t|Pitfalls in the diagnosis and initial management of acute cerebral venous thrombosis.
31064164|a|Cerebral venous thrombosis is an important etiology of stroke in young patients. Its clinical manifestations are variable and based on different involved venous or sinus processes. Cerebral venous thrombosis could mimic ischemic infarction and is easy to misdiagnose. Although many patients have favorable outcomes, delayed or incorrect diagnosis due to atypical symptoms may lead to a poor prognosis. Here we present a case of a 33-year-old woman with transient headache and recurrent right extremity weakness whose symptoms progressed and were sustained in the hospital. She was diagnosed with ischemic infarction and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) thrombolysis was performed. However, her symptoms progressed, and intracranial hematoma was found on a computed tomography scan. Ruling out other hemorrhage etiology, we confirmed the presence of cerebral venous thrombosis using magnetic resonance venography. She underwent mechanical thrombectomy and her condition improved thereafter. This case raises the awareness that in young woman patients on oral contraceptives with neurological deficits and headache, cerebral venous thrombosis is a considerable diagnosis. A contrast CT or MRI scan should be ordered in the early course of evaluation, which can help the physician to make the right clinical decision.

30587162|t|Risk factors associated with 31-day unplanned readmission in 50,912 discharged patients after stroke in China.
30587162|a|BACKGROUND: Unplanned readmission within 31 days of discharge after stroke is a useful indicator for monitoring quality of hospital care. We evaluated the risk factors associated with 31-day unplanned readmission of stroke patients in China. METHODS: We identified 50,912 patients from 375 hospitals in 29 provinces, municipalities or autonomous districts across China who experienced an unplanned readmission after stroke between 2015 and 2016, and extracted data from the inpatients' cover sheet data from the Medical Record Monitoring Database. Patients were grouped into readmission within 31 days or beyond for analysis. Chi-squared test was used to analyze demographic information, health system and clinical process-related factors according to the data type. Multilevel logistic modeling was used to examine the effects of patient (level 1) and hospital (level 2) characteristics on an unplanned readmission ≤31 days. RESULTS: Among 50,912 patients, 14,664 (28.8%) were readmitted within 31 days after discharge. The commonest cause of readmissions were recurrent stroke (34.8%), hypertension (22.94%), cardio/cerebrovascular disease (13.26%) and diabetes/diabetic complications (7.34%). Higher risks of unplanned readmissions were associated with diabetes (OR = 1.089, P = 0.001), use of clinical pathways (OR = 1.174, P < 0.001), and being discharged without doctor's advice (OR = 1.485, P < 0.001). Lower risks were associated with basic medical insurances (OR ranging from 0.225 to 0.716, P < 0.001) and commercial medical insurance (OR = 0.636, P = 0.021), compared to self-paying for medical services. And patients aged 50 years old and above (OR ranging from 0.650 to 0.985, P < 0.05), with haemorrhagic stroke (OR = 0.467, P < 0.001), with length of stay more than 7 days in hospital (OR ranging from 0.082 to 0.566, P < 0.001), also had lower risks. CONCLUSIONS: Age, type of stroke, medical insurance status, type of discharge, use of clinical pathways, length of hospital stay and comorbidities were the most influential factors for readmission within 31 days.

30584250|t|The Traditional Chinese Medicine MLC901 inhibits inflammation processes after focal cerebral ischemia.
30584250|a|Inflammation is considered as a major contributor to brain injury following cerebral ischemia. The therapeutic potential of both MLC601/MLC901, which are herbal extract preparations derived from Chinese Medicine, has been reported both in advanced stroke clinical trials and also in animal and cellular models. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of MLC901 on the different steps of post-ischemic inflammation in focal ischemia in mice. In vivo injury was induced by 60 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. MLC901 was administered in post-treatment 90 min after the onset of ischemia and once a day during reperfusion. MLC901 treatment resulted in a reduction in infarct volume, a decrease of Blood Brain Barrier leakage and brain swelling, an improvement in neurological scores and a reduction of mortality rate at 24 hours after MCAO. These beneficial effects of MLC901 were accompanied by an inhibition of astrocytes and microglia/macrophage activation, a drastically decreased neutrophil invasion into the ischemic brain as well as by a negative regulation of pro-inflammatory mediator expression (cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases). MLC901 significantly inhibited the expression of Prx6 as well as the transcriptional activity of NFκB and the activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, an important pathway in the immune response in the ischemic brain. MLC901 effects on the neuroinflammation cascade induced by cerebral ischemia probably contribute, in a very significant way, in its potential therapeutic value.

30622459|t|IRAK-M Deficiency Exacerbates Ischemic Neurovascular Injuries in Experimental Stroke Mice.
30622459|a|Background: Innate immune response to neuronal death is one of the key events of the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-M, encoded by gene Irak3, negatively regulates toll-like receptor signaling by interacting with the MyD88-IRAK-4-IRAK-1 complex and blocking the phosphorylation and dissociation of IRAK-1. Its function in the ischemic stroke is unknown. Objective: This study aims to investigate whether IRAK-M deficiency could exacerbate neuroinflammation and neurovascular injuries during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice and Irak3 knockout mice were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion and 4 or 24 h of reperfusion. Transcription of Irak3 gene was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Then, infarct volume, neurological score, brain water content, and Evans blue leakage were compared between knock-out and wild-type mice after reperfusion. Through the observation of gross brain specimen after cerebral ischemia, the incidence of hemorrhage transformation was compared between KO and WT mice. To explore underlying signaling pathways involved in IRAK-M deficiency, major proinflammatory cytokines and NF-κB signaling were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results: The expression of IRAK-M peaked at 1 h after reperfusion, and then gradually decreased within the first 24 h, which was abolished by blocking the expression of hypoxia induced factor 1α. IRAK-M deficiency increased infarct volume, brain edema, the incidence of hemorrhage transformation, and the permeability of blood-brain barrier. In addition, the NF-κB-mediated expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of microglia in the ipsilateral brain from knock-out mice were much higher than those in wild-type littermates. Conclusion: IRAK-M deletion exacerbates neurovascular damages which are related to the pronounced activation of NF-κB signaling and neuroinflammatory responses during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in mice. Our study indicates that IRAK-M has neuroprotective effect and has potential to facilitate the development of new pharmaceuticals that reduce neurovascular complications.

30647760|t|Systematic Understanding of the Mechanism of Baicalin against Ischemic Stroke through a Network Pharmacology Approach.
30647760|a|Ischemic stroke is accompanied by high mortality and morbidity rates. At present, there is no effective clinical treatment. Alternatively, traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used in China and Japan for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Baicalin is a flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis that has been shown to be effective against ischemic stroke; however, its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Based on network pharmacology, we explored the potential mechanism of baicalin on a system level. After obtaining baicalin structural information from the PubChem database, an approach combined with literature mining and PharmMapper prediction was used to uncover baicalin targets. Ischemic stroke-related targets were gathered with the help of DrugBank, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Genetic Association Database (GAD), and Therapeutic Target Database (TTD). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed through the Cytoscape plugin BisoGenet and analyzed by topological methods. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were carried out via the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) server. We obtained a total of 386 potential targets and 5 signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and forkhead box (FOXO) signaling pathways. GO analysis showed that these targets were associated with antiapoptosis, antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation, and other physiopathological processes that are involved in anti-ischemic stroke effects. In summary, the mechanism of baicalin against ischemic stroke involved multiple targets and signaling pathways. Our study provides a network pharmacology framework for future research on traditional Chinese medicine.

30562971|t|Galangin Inhibits Thrombin-Induced MMP-9 Expression in SK-N-SH Cells via Protein Kinase-Dependent NF-κB Phosphorylation.
30562971|a|Galangin, a member of the flavonol compounds of the flavonoids, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in various cell types. It has been used for the treatment of arthritis, airway inflammation, stroke, and cognitive impairment. Thrombin, one of the regulators of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), has been known as a vital factor of physiological and pathological processes, including cell migration, the blood⁻brain barrier breakdown, brain edema formation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. MMP-9 especially may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effect of galangin in combating thrombin-induced MMP-9 expression is not well understood in neurons. Therefore, we attempted to explore the molecular mechanisms by which galangin inhibited MMP-9 expression and cell migration induced by thrombin in SK-N-SH cells (a human neuroblastoma cell line). Gelatin zymography, western blot, real-time PCR, and cell migration assay were used to elucidate the inhibitory effects of galangin on the thrmbin-mediated responses. The results showed that galangin markedly attenuated the thrombin-stimulated phosphorylation of proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (c-Src), proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), protein kinase C (PKC)α/β/δ, protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK)1/2, p38 MAPK, forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), p65, and c-Jun and suppressed MMP-9 expression and cell migration in SK-N-SH cells. Our results concluded that galangin blocked the thrombin-induced MMP-9 expression in SK-N-SH cells via inhibiting c-Src, Pyk2, PKCα/βII/δ, Akt, mTOR, p42/p44 MAPK, JNK1/2, p38 MAPK, FoxO1, c-Jun, and p65 phosphorylation and ultimately attenuated cell migration. Therefore, galangin may be a potential candidate for the management of brain inflammatory diseases.

30559164|t|Poststroke depression and risk of stroke recurrence and mortality: protocol of a meta-analysis and systematic review.
30559164|a|INTRODUCTION: A number of observational studies have indicated that poststroke depression could increase the risk of stroke outcomes. There is a meta-analysis indicating that poststroke depression is a risk factor of all-cause mortality. This paper reports the protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the associations of poststroke depression with stroke recurrence and mortality in order to determine whether poststroke depression is a predictor of stroke outcomes according to data extracted from relevant observational studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEDLINE, Web of Science databases, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be used to conduct the search. Published studies written in English will be included. The risk of bias for the studies included in the systematic review or meta-analysis will be assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. HRs for stroke recurrence and mortality with 95% CIs will be included as primary outcomes. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression will be performed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval will not be needed because the data used in this systematic review will be extracted from published studies. The results of the systematic review focusing on whether depression after stroke is a predictor for stroke recurrence and mortality will be disseminated by publication in a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018107944.

30484473|t|Systematic studies on the in vivo substance basis and the pharmacological mechanism of Acanthopanax Senticosus Harms leaves by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS coupled with a target-network method.
30484473|a|The leaves of Acanthopanax Senticosus Harms (ASL) can be used as a food ingredient and also as raw materials for making tea and wine. As a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), ASL has demonstrated significant effects in the treatment of ischemic stroke, but the substance basis and the pharmacological mechanism of ASL are unclear. In this study, a sensitive and rapid method was constructed for the separation and identification of the absorbed prototype components and metabolites from ASL in rat plasma and brain using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). A database of ASL active ingredients was established, which comprised 27 prototype ingredients and 20 metabolites from the rat plasma and 10 prototype ingredients and 7 metabolites from the rat brain. A comprehensive and effective target-network pharmacological method for tracing co-related targets and pathways between ASL and ischemic stroke was also set up. As a result, 34 targets and 30 pathways were obtained. TNF, NF-κB, IL-6, IL-1B, ICAM, and MMP-9 targets are all critical factors related to ischemic stroke, while the NF-κB signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and arachidonic acid metabolism play significant roles in the development of ischemic stroke. The visualized relationship between ASL and ischemic stroke was demonstrated by compound-target networks and compound-target-pathway networks, which revealed the therapeutic targets around the signaling pathways of ASL in the treatment of ischemic stroke. This research method will open a window for the mechanistic studies of TCM in the treatment of diseases.

30545139|t|Protective Effects and Target Network Analysis of Ginsenoside Rg1 in Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury: A Comprehensive Overview of Experimental Studies.
30545139|a|Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion is a complicated pathological process. The injury and cascade reactions caused by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion are characterized by high mortality, high recurrence, and high disability. However, only a limited number of antithrombotic drugs, such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-TPA), aspirin, and heparin, are currently available for ischemic stroke, and its safety concerns is inevitable which associated with reperfusion injury and hemorrhage. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore and examine some potential neuroprotective agents with treatment for cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury to reduce safety concerns caused by antithrombotic drugs in ischemic stroke. Ginseng Rg1 (G-Rg1) is a saponin composed of natural active ingredients and derived from the roots or stems of Panax notoginseng and ginseng in traditional Chinese medicine. Its pharmacological effects exert remarkable neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system. To explore and summarize the protective effects and mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg1 against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury, we conducted this review, in which we searched the PubMed database to obtain and organize studies concerning the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg1 against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury. This study provides a valuable reference and clues for the development of new agents to combat ischemic stroke. Our summarized review and analysis show that the pharmacological effects of and mechanisms underlying ginsenoside Rg1 activity against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury mainly involve 4 sets of mechanisms: anti-oxidant activity and associated apoptosis via the Akt, Nrf2/HO-1, PPARγ/HO-1, extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways (or mitochondrial apoptosis pathway) and the caspase-3/ROCK1/MLC pathway; anti-inflammatory and immune stimulatory-related activities that involve apoptosis or necrosis via MAPK pathways (the JNK1/2 + ERK1/2 and PPARγ/HO-1 pathways), endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), high mobility group protein1 (HMGB1)-induced TLR2/4/9 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) pathways, and the activation of NF-κB; neurological cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration via the MAPK pathways (JNK1/2 + ERK1/2, PI3K-Akt/mTOR, PKB/Akt and HIF-1α/VEGF pathways); and energy metabolism and the regulation of cellular ATP levels, the blood-brain barrier and other effects via N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, ERS, and AMP/AMPK-GLUT pathways. Collectively, these mechanisms result in significant neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic injury. These findings will be valuable in that they should further promote the development of candidate drugs and provide more information to support the application of previous findings in stroke clinical trials.

30564291|t|Effects of Tai Chi Yunshou exercise on community-based stroke patients: a cluster randomized controlled trial.
30564291|a|Backgroud: Tai Chi Chuan was used for stroke survivors with balance impairments. However, even a short-form of Tai Chi Chuan includes forms that make the exercise challenging for the stroke survivors. Tai Chi Yunshou (wave hands in the cloud) is the "mother" form and the fundamental form of all Tai Chi Chuan styles, which is considered more suitable and feasible for stroke survivors with balance impairments. So this study was designed to evaluate the effects of Tai Chi Yunshou exercise on community-based stroke patients with balance dysfunctions. Methods: A total of 250 participants from 10 community health centers (5 per arm) were selected and randomly allocated into Tai Chi Yunshou exercise group (TC group) or a balance rehabilitation training group (control group) in an equal ratio. Participants in the TC group were received Tai Chi Yunshou exercise training five times per week for 12 weeks and those in control group were received balance rehabilitation training five times per week for 12 weeks. Outcome assessments including Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Time up to go test (TUGT), Modified Barthel Index (MBI) were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and followed-up 6 weeks (18 weeks), 12 weeks (24 weeks). Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Analysis of variance of repeated measures was used to assess between-group differences. Results: A total of 244 participants, 120 in the TC group and 124 in the rehabilitation group, were included in final analysis. There was no siginificant difference in Tai Chi Yunshou and balance rehabilitation training on the improvement of balance ability and mobility (P = 0.531 and P = 0.839, respectively) after adjustment for baseline. However, there was significant difference between two groups on improvement of motor funtion (P = 0.022), fear of falling (P < 0.001) and depression (P = 0.035) for the post stroke patients. No adverse events were reported during the study. Conclusion: Tai Chi Yunshou and balance rehabilitation training led to improved balance ability and functional mobility, and both are suitable community-based programs that may benefit for stroke recovery and community reintegration. Our data demonstrated that a 12-week Tai Chi Yunshou intervention was more effective in motor function, fear of falling and depression than balance rehabilitation training. Future studies examining the effectiveness of Tai Chi Yunahou as a balance ability improvement strategy for community-dwelling survivors of stroke are recommended. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trail Registry: ChiCRT-TRC-13003641. Registration date: 22 August, 2013.

30520514|t|Traditional Chinese herbal medicine for vascular dementia.
30520514|a|BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCHM) is widely used for treating vascular dementia (VaD) in China. Recent studies of a number of TCHMs have demonstrated in vitro biological activity and therapeutic effects in animals, but the published clinical evidence has not been systematically appraised. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCHMs listed in either the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (CP) or the Chinese National Essential Drug List (NEDL) that are used to treat VaD. A secondary aim was to identify promising TCHMs for further clinical research. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register (on 14 March 2018) and also several Chinese biomedical databases: the Chinese Biological Medicine Database (January 1979 to May 2015), Wanfang database (January 1998 to May 2015), Chongqing VIP Information Co. Ltd or Weipu (January 1998 to May 2015) and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (January 1979 to May 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of TCHMs compared to placebo, to Western medicine (WM) or to routine therapy for VaD risk factors. Eligible participants were men and women aged 18 years and above, diagnosed with VaD by any of the following four criteria: (1) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) versions III, III-R, IV, IV-TR; (2) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS-AIREN); (3) International Classification of Diseases 9 or 10; (4) the Hachinski or the Modified Hachinski Ischaemic Score. We required the use of an imaging technique to differentiate VaD from other dementias. We excluded (1) trials with participants diagnosed with mixed dementia or those that did not use an imaging technique to ascertain VaD; (2) trials of NEDL-listed Gingko biloba or Huperzine A as experimental interventions, to avoid duplication of existing Cochrane Reviews; (3) trials using acupuncture alone as the experimental intervention; (4) trials using another CP- or NEDL-listed TCHM (except for Huperzine A and Gingko which are popular in Western practice) as the control intervention; and (5) trials using purely non-pharmacological interventions as the control intervention unless explicitly described as 'routine therapy for VaD risk factors'. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed the risks of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and adapted the Outcome Reporting Bias in Trials (ORBIT) classification system for outcome reporting bias. We assessed TCHM effects on five clinically important outcomes: cognition, global performance, safety, activities of daily living and behaviour and summarised the effects using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios or risk differences for binary outcomes. We stratified the studies into those that estimated the TCHM versus 'no treatment' effect and those that estimated the TCHM versus the WM effect, with further stratification by the specific TCHM tested or by one of the four modes of action. We pooled using a random-effects model. Due to substantial clinical and design heterogeneity, we did not estimate an 'overall TCHM effect'. MAIN RESULTS: We only found studies (47 studies, 3581 participants) for 18 of the 29 eligible TCHMs as defined by our inclusion criteria. All were superiority trials conducted in China between 1997 and 2013, with most employing a two-arm parallel design with sample sizes ranging from 26 to 240 and a median treatment duration of 12 weeks (range: 2 to 24 weeks).We found that reporting and trial methodology were generally poor; in particular, there was a lack of information on randomisation, an absence of blinding of participants and outcome assessors and incomplete reporting of adverse events (AEs). None of the 30 trials published from 2007 onwards adopted the CONSORT recommendations for reporting RCTs of herbal interventions.We found seven TCHMs which each had potentially large benefits in studies estimating the TCHM versus 'no treatment' effect and in studies estimating the TCHM versus the WM effect. Two TCHMs (NaoXinTong and TongXinLuo) were common to both groups. Three of these TCHMs - Nao XinTong, NaoMaiTai and TongXinLuo - had the strongest evidence to justify further research. Two TCHMs (NaoMaiTai and TongXinLuo) had a 5% or more increased risk of AEs compared to the 'no Treatment' control, but the quality of this evidence was poor. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found moderate- to very low-quality evidence of benefit and harm of TCHMs for VaD. Methodological inadequacies need to be addressed by better conducted and reported trials. We identified NaoMaiTai, NaoXinTong and TongXinLuo as warranting special research priority.

30627564|t|A Preliminary Study on Discriminant Analysis of Syndrome Types in the Recovery Period of Stroke in Traditional Chinese Medicine.
30627564|a|Objective: The purpose of this study is to understand the distribution of syndrome types, the data of four diagnostic information variables, and the correlative degree and diagnostic value of four diagnosis indexes and syndromes in patients with the recovery period of ischemic stroke through clinical case data. Methods: This study developed a unified clinical case collection table, following the clinical research design, measurement, and evaluation methods, using Chi-Square test, logistic regression analysis, and diagnostic test evaluation methods for data screening, analysis, and testing. Results: According to the comprehensive comparison, analysis, and evaluation, the study concluded that the specificity, sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, and Youden index of "thick fur, slippery pulse" was the highest. Conclusion: "thick fur, slippery pulse" is the best combination to diagnose the phlegm-stasis in channels during the recovery period of ischemic stroke.

30564092|t|Buyang Huanwu Decoction Targets SIRT1/VEGF Pathway to Promote Angiogenesis After Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.
30564092|a|Background: Ischemia stroke is known as the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD), a classical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, has been used to prevent and treat stoke for hundreds of years. The purpose of present study is to investigate the effects of BHD on angiogenesis in rats after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury targeting Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) / Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. Methods: The cerebral I/R injury model was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Adult Sprag-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham group, normal saline (NS) group, BHD group, BHD+EX527 (SIRT1 specific inhibitor) group, and NS+EX527 group. Each group was divided into the subgroups according to 1, 3, 7, or 14 days time-point after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, respectively. Neurological function score (NFS) was evaluated by the Rogers scale; microvascular density (MVD) in brain tissue around infarction area was observed by immunofluorescence; and the expression of SIRT1 and VEGF was assessed by Western Blot and Quantitative Real-time-PCR. Results: BHD can significantly improve NFS (P < 0.05), increase the MVD in the boundary ischemic area (P < 0.01) and elevate the expression of protein and mRNA of SIRT1 and VEGF following I/R injury (P < 0.01). In contrast, treatment with EX527 reversed the BHD-induced improvements in NFS (P < 0.01) and decreased the MVD (P < 0.01) and the expression of SIRT1 and VEGF (P < 0.05). Conclusion: BHD exerts neuroprotection targeting angiogenesis through the up-regulation of SIRT1/VEGF pathway against cerebral ischemic injury in rats.

30257960|t|Electroacupuncture ameliorates cognitive impairment through inhibition of Ca2+-mediated neurotoxicity in a rat model of cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury.
30257960|a|BACKGROUND: The hippocampus is vulnerable to severe damage after cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study aimed to explore the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on cognitive impairment and its relationship with Ca2+neurotoxicity in a rat model of I/R injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: 60 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control (sham surgery) group, untreated MCAO group and EA-treated MCAO+EA group. Rats in the MCAO and MCAO+EA groups underwent modelling of poststroke cognitive impairment by MCAO surgery. EA was performed for 30 min daily at GV20 and GV24 (1-20 Hz) for 1 week. The Morris water maze experiment was used to assess cognitive function. 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining was used to measure infarct volume. The intracellular Ca2+content in the Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 area of the hippocampus was assessed by laser confocal scanning microscopy. ELISA was performed to evaluate the concentration of glutamate (Glu) in the hippocampus, and the protein expression of two Glu receptors (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) 2A and NMDAR2B) were analysed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Compared with the untreated MCAO group, EA effectively ameliorated cognitive impairment (P=0.01) and shrunk the infarct volume (P=0.032). The content of intracellular Ca2+, Glu and NMDAR2B in the hippocampus was significantly raised by MCAO (P=0.031-0.043), while EA abrogated these effects. NMDAR2A was decreased by MCAO (P=0.015) but increased by EA (P=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: EA had a beneficial effect on cognitive repair after cerebral I/R, and its mechanism of action likely involves a reduction of Ca2+influx via inhibition of Glu neurotoxicity and downregulation of NMDAR2B expression.

30245469|t|Melatonin improves vascular cognitive impairment induced by ischemic stroke by remyelination via activation of ERK1/2 signaling and restoration of glutamatergic synapses in the gerbil hippocampus.
30245469|a|Vascular dementia affects cognition by damaging axons and myelin. Melatonin is pharmacologically associated with various neurological disorders. In this study, effects of melatonin on cognitive impairment and related mechanisms were investigated in an animal model of ischemic vascular dementia (IVD). Melatonin was intraperitoneally administered to adult gerbils after transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI) for 25 days beginning 5 days after tGCI. Cognitive impairment was examined using a passive avoidance test and the Barnes maze test. To investigate mechanisms of restorative effects by melatonin, neuronal damage/death, myelin basic protein (MBP, a marker for myelin), Rip (a marker for oligodendrocyte), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT)-1 (a glutamatergic synaptic marker) in the hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 1 area (CA1) were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Melatonin treatment significantly improved tGCI-induced cognitive impairment. Death of CA1 pyramidal neurons after tGCI was not affected by melatonin treatment. However, melatonin treatment significantly increased MBP immunoreactivity and numbers of Rip-immunoreactive oligodendrocytes in the ischemic CA1. In addition, melatonin treatment significantly increased ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 immunoreactivities in oligodendrocytes in the ischemic CA1. Furthermore, melatonin treatment significantly increased VGLUT-1 immunoreactive structures in the ischemic CA1. These results indicate that long-term melatonin treatment after tGCI improves cognitive deficit via restoration of myelin, increase of oligodendrocytes which is closely related to the activation of ERK1/2 signaling, and increase of glutamatergic synapses in the ischemic brain area.

30088421|t|Effects of MOTOmed movement therapy on the mobility and activities of daily living of stroke patients with hemiplegia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
30088421|a|OBJECTIVE:: To estimate the effectiveness of MOTOmed® movement therapy in increasing mobility and activities of daily living in stroke patients with hemiplegia. DESIGN:: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES:: English- and Chinese-language articles published from the start of database coverage through 20 June 2018 were retrieved from the Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, OVID, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, Wanfang, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, and Chinese Biomedicine databases. Articles were also retrieved by manual searches of Rehabilitation Medicine and Chinese journals. METHODS:: Randomized control trials examining MOTOmed movement therapy interventions for patients with post-stroke hemiplegia were included in this review. The risk of bias assessment tool was utilized in accordance with Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0. All included studies reported mobility effects as primary outcomes. Standardized mean differences or mean differences with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Review Manager 5.3 was utilized for meta-analysis. RESULTS:: In total, 19 trials involving a total of 1099 patients were included in the analysis. All studies were of moderate quality, based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention: Part 2:8.5. MOTOmed movement therapy resulted in a merged mean difference in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment score of 5.51 (95% CI: 4.03 to 6.98). Comparison of groups treated with and without MOTOmed movement therapy yielded the following mean differences: Modified Ashworth Scale, -1.13 (95% CI: -1.37 to -0.89); Berg Balance Scale, 13.66 (95% CI: 10.47-16.85); Functional Ambulation Category Scale, 0.85 (95% CI: 0.68-1.03); 10-m walk test, 10.15 (95% CI: 5.72-14.58); Barthel Index, 14.82 (95% CI: 12.96-16.68); and Modified Barthel Index, 11.49 (95% CI: 8.96-14.03). CONCLUSION:: MOTOmed movement therapy combined with standard rehabilitation improves mobility and activities of daily living in stroke patients with hemiplegia.

30542450|t|Electroacupuncture stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells in a rat model of ischemic stroke.
30542450|a|Electroacupuncture (EA) may stimulate neurogenesis in animal models of ischemic stroke; however, the associated mechanisms are not clear. The present study aimed to evaluate the neurogenesis efficacy of EA on ischemic stroke and the underlying associated mechanisms. A model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was employed as the rat model of brain ischemia and reperfusion. EA treatment at the GV20 (Baihui) and GV14 (Dazhui) acupoints was conducted for 30 min daily following MCAO. Immunofluorescence was performed to measure the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)/nestin- or BrdU/doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells in the sham, MCAO and MCAO + EA groups. Results indicated that EA stimulation significantly decreased the neurological score and neuronal loss in rats in the MCAO group (both P<0.05). Furthermore, immunostaining assays indicated that BrdU/nestin- and BrdU/DCX-positive cells in EA-treated rats were significantly increased (P<0.05) when compared with the rats in the MCAO group, indicating EA may induce the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells (eNSCs) during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. In addition, EA treatment significantly enhanced the protein expression levels of plasticity-related gene 5 (PRG5), a critical neurogenesis factor, and significantly decreased the protein expression levels of three neurogenesis inhibiting molecules, NogoA, lysophosphatidic acid and RhoA (all P<0.05). These results suggested that EA promotes the proliferation and differentiation of eNSCs, likely through modulating PRG5/RhoA signaling.

30444083|t|Simultaneous screening and isolation of activated constituents from Puerariae Flos by ultrafiltration with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry combined with high-speed counter-current chromatography.
30444083|a|Puerariae Flos is the flower of Puerariae Radix, which is a common Chinese herb containing numerous isoflavones in all parts of the flower. Standard methods for screening and isolating isoflavones are typically labor intensive and time consuming. In this study, a new assay based on ultrafiltration with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry was developed for the rapid screening and identification of ligands for α-glucosidase, xanthine oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase in the extract of Puerariae Flos. Three isoflavones were identified as α-glucosidase inhibitors, three isoflavones were identified as lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, and no specific binding ligands were identified for xanthine oxidase in the extract. Subsequently, specific binding ligands, puerarin, genistin, and tectorigenin (purities were 90, 60, 99, and 91.73%, respectively), were separated by high-speed counter-current chromatography. The partition coefficient values of the target compounds and resolutions of peaks were employed as indicators and the solvent system and mobile phase flow rate were optimized for two-stage separation. An optimized two-phase solvent system comprised of ethyl acetate/ethanol/water (4:0.5:3, v/v/v) was successfully used to isolate the three compounds from Puerariae Flos. The monomer compounds isolated, collected, and purified by high-speed counter-current chromatography were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, resulting in the isolation of three targeted compounds. The chemical structures of all three targeted compounds were individually identified by ultra high performance liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate that ultrafiltration with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry combined with high-speed counter-current chromatography is not only a powerful tool for screening and isolating α-glucosidase and lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors in complex samples, but also a useful platform for identifying bioactive compounds for preventing and treating diabetes and stroke.

30593181|t|Traditional Chinese medicine for post-stroke depression: A systematic review and network meta-analysis (Protocol).
30593181|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is common in stroke survivors, with significantly negative effects and serious impairments in terms of personal and social functioning. While both pharmacological and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) interventions have been administered for PSD, there is still uncertainty about the balance between these and what treatment strategy should be preferred in clinical practice. Therefore, we aim to compare and rank, describing the protocol of a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA), the commonly used TCM interventions for PSD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, CBM and PsycINFO, the US National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organisation International Trials Registry Platform search portal from inception to November 2018. There will be no restrictions on language, publication year or publication type. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) accessing any TCM treatments against active comparator or other controls for PSD will be included. The primary outcomes will be efficacy (the total number of participants, declining more than 50% on the total score between baseline) and acceptability of treatment (dropout rate due to any cause). A Bayesian NMA will be performed to compare all relative outcome of different TCM interventions. we will conduct the network meta-regression meta-analyses of data on the sex ratio, the types of stroke and the treatment duration of TCM interventions. Potential explanations in extra subgroup analyses according to the results of heterogeneity and inconsistency will be explored, and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. TRIALS REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42018082400. CONCLUSION: Our study will generate evidence for TCM in the treatment of PSD and help to reduce the uncertainty about the effectiveness of PSD management, which will encourage further suggestions for TCM clinical practice or guideline.

29804491|t|Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography/Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabonomics Reveal Protective Effect of Terminalia chebula Extract on Ischemic Stroke Rats.
29804491|a|Terminalia chebula (TC), a kind of Combretaceae, is a widely used herb in India and East Asia to treat cerebrovascular diseases. However, the potential mechanism of the neuroprotective effects of TC at the metabonomics level is still not clear. The present study focused on the effects of TC on metabonomics in a stroke model. Rats were divided randomly into sham, model, and TC groups. Rats in the TC group were intragastrically administered with TC for 7 days after a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) operation. The sham and the model groups received vehicle for the same length of time. Subsequently, the neuroprotective effects of TC were examined by evaluation of neurological defects, assessment of infarct volume, and identification of biochemical indicators for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Further, metabonomics technology was employed to evaluate the endogenous metabolites profiling systematically. Consist with the results of biochemical and histopathological assays, pattern recognition analysis showed a clear separation of the model group and the sham group, indicating the recovery impact of TC on the MCAO rats. Moreover, 12 potential biomarkers were identified in the MCAO model group, involving energy (lactic acid, succinic acid, and fumarate), amino acids (leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine), and glycerophospholipid (PC [16:0/20:4], PC [20:4/20:4], LysoPC [18:0], and LysoPC [16:0]) metabolism, as well as other types of metabolism (arachidonic acid and palmitoylcarnitine). Notably, it was found that metabolite levels of TC group were partially reversed to normal. In conclusion, TC could ameliorate MCAO in rats by affecting energy metabolism (glycolysis and the TCA cycle), amino acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and other types of metabolism.

30501621|t|Mitophagy, a potential therapeutic target for stroke.
30501621|a|Mitochondria autophagy, termed as mitophagy, is a mechanism of specific autophagic elimination of mitochondria. Mitophagy controls the quality and the number of mitochondria, eliminating dysfunctional or excessive mitochondria that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause cell death. Mitochondria are centrally implicated in neuron and tissue injury after stroke, due to the function of supplying adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the tissue, regulating oxidative metabolism during the pathologic process, and contribution to apoptotic cell death after stroke. As a catabolic mechanism, mitophagy links numbers of a complex network of mitochondria, and affects mitochondrial dynamic process, fusion and fission, reducing mitochondrial production of ROS, mediated by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). The precise nature of mitophagy's involvement in stroke, and its underlying molecular mechanisms, have yet to be fully clarified. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the integration of mitochondria with mitophagy, also to introduce and discuss recent advances in the understanding of the potential role, and possible signaling pathway, of mitophagy in the pathological processes of both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The author also provides evidence to explain the dual role of mitophagy in stroke.

30480757|t|Acupuncture for hypertension.
30480757|a|BACKGROUND: Elevated blood pressure (hypertension) affects about one billion people worldwide. It is important as it is a major risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction. However, it remains a challenge for the medical profession as many people with hypertension have blood pressure (BP) that is not well controlled. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, acupuncture has the potential to lower BP. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for lowering blood pressure in adults with primary hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (February 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2017, Issue 2; MEDLINE (February 2017); Embase (February 2017), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (January 2015), VIP Database (January 2015), the World Health Organisation Clinical Trials Registry Platform (February 2017)and ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2017). There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the clinical effects of an acupuncture intervention (acupuncture used alone or add-on) with no treatment, a sham acupuncture or an antihypertensive drug in adults with primary hypertension. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. They extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each trial, and telephoned or emailed the authors of the studies to ask for missing information. A third review author resolved disagreements. Outcomes included change in systolic blood pressure (SBP), change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), withdrawal due to adverse effects, and any adverse events. We calculated pooled mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes using a fixed-effect or random-effects model where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two RCTs (1744 people) met our inclusion criteria. The RCTs were of variable methodological quality (most at high risk of bias because of lack of blinding). There was no evidence for a sustained BP lowering effect of acupuncture; only one trial investigated a sustained effect and found no BP lowering effect at three and six months after acupuncture. Four sham acupuncture controlled trials provided very low quality evidence that acupuncture had a short-term (one to 24 hours) effect on SBP (change) -3.4 mmHg (-6.0 to -0.9) and DBP -1.9 mmHg (95% CI -3.6 to -0.3). Pooled analysis of eight trials comparing acupuncture with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and seven trials comparing acupuncture to calcium antagonists suggested that acupuncture lowered short-term BP better than the antihypertensive drugs. However, because of the very high risk of bias in these trials, we think that this is most likely a reflection of bias and not a true effect. As a result, we did not report these results in the 'Summary of findings' table. Safety of acupuncture could not be assessed as only eight trials reported adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is no evidence for the sustained BP lowering effect of acupuncture that is required for the management of chronically elevated BP. The short-term effects of acupuncture are uncertain due to the very low quality of evidence. The larger effect shown in non-sham acupuncture controlled trials most likely reflects bias and is not a true effect. Future RCTs must use sham acupuncture controls and assess whether there is a BP lowering effect of acupuncture that lasts at least seven days.

30672194|t|[Clinical observation of long-time needle retaining at Baihui (GV 20) on post-stroke cognitive disorder of qi deficiency and blood stasis].
30672194|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of long-time needle retaining at Baihui (GV 20) on post-stroke cognitive disorder of qi deficiency and blood stasis. METHODS: A total of 70 patients (3 cases dropping) with post-stroke cognitive disorder of qi deficiency and blood stasis were randomized into an observation group (34 cases) and a control group (33 cases). Neurological routine treatment and western medicine rehabilitation therapy were given in the control group as the basic treatment, on the basis of the treatment as the control group, long-time needle retaining at Baihui (GV 20) was applied in the observation group. The treatment was given once every other day, 3 times a week for a total of 4 weeks. The National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and qi deficiency blood stasis syndrome scale score were observed before and after treatment, and the clinical efficacy was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment, the NIHSS scores of the two groups were lower than those before treatment (both P<0.01), and the MMSE and MoCA scores were higher than those before treatment (P<0.05, P<0.01), and the scores in the observation group were better than those in the control group (all P<0.01). After treatment, the scores of qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome were lower than those before treatment (all P<0.01). The scores of the shortness of breath, facial color, tongue pulse and dizziness in the observation group were better than those in the control group (all P<0.05), there was no significant difference in the degree of spontaneous sweating between the two groups (P>0.05). The total effective rate was 94.1% (32/34) in the observation group, which was higher than 75.8% (25/33) in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Long-time needle retaining at Baihui (GV 20) is safe and effective in treating with post-stroke cognitive disorder of qi deficiency and blood stasis.

30459599|t|Assessing the Pharmacological and Therapeutic Efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Liangxue Tongyu Prescription for Intracerebral Hemorrhagic Stroke in Neurological Disease Models.
30459599|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage is a fatal subtype of stroke, with crucial impact on public health. Surgical removal of the hematoma as an early-stage treatment for ICH can't improve long-term prognosis remarkably. Liangxue tongyu prescription (LP), a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula, includes eight ingredients and has been used to treat ICH in the clinical. In the study, we elucidated the pharmacological efficacy and therapeutic efficacy of LP to dissect the mechanism of LP against ICH via network analysis and experimental validation. First, we discovered 34 potential compounds and 146 corresponding targets in LP based on network prediction. 24 signal pathway were obtained by the Clue Go assay based on potential compounds in LP against ICH. Second, we found that LP can not only decreased the level of high sensitive C reactive protein (HS-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), NF-kβ, D-dimmer (D2D), estradiol (E2), S-100B, neuron specific enolase (NSE), and interleukin 1 (IL-1) in plasma on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), but also promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis on the glutamate-induced PC12 cell. The compounds including Taurine, Paeonol, and Ginsenoside Rb1 in LP can activate PI3K/AKT pathway. Third, from the three-factor two-level factorial design, compound combinations in LP, such as Taurine and Paeonol, Taurine and Geniposide, Ginsenoside Rg1, and Ginsenoside Rb1, had first-level interactions on cell proliferation. Compound combinations including Taurine and Paeonol, Ginsenoside Rg1 and Ginsenoside Rb1 had as significant increase in efficiency on inhibiting the apoptosis of PC12 cells at the low concentration and up-regulating of PI3K and AKT. Overall, our results suggested that LP had integrated therapeutic effect on ICH due to activities of anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulation, blood vessel protection, and protection neuron from excitotoxicity based on the way of "multi-component, multi-target, multi-pathway," and compound combination in LP can offer protection neuron from excitotoxicity at the low concentration by activation of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway.

30292407|t|MicroRNA-182-5p attenuates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by targeting Toll-like receptor 4.
30292407|a|Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion-induced microglial activation causes neuronal death through the release of inflammatory cytokines. Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) exert a neuroprotective effect by modulating the inflammatory process in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Furthermore, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is increasingly being considered to have a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. However, whether miRNAs mediate their neuroprotective effects by regulating TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses remains unknown. To explore this gap in the literature, we conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vitro: BV2 cells were activated by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). TLR4 and inflammatory cytokine (TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1β) transcription and translation expression levels were assessed using RT-PCR, ELISA, and western blot. BV2 cells were transfected with miR-182-5p mimics, inhibitors, siTLR4, or negative control (NC) using lipofectamine 2000 reagent. To confirm whether TLR4 is a direct target of miR-182-5p, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. In BV2 cells, we observed that OGD upregulated TLR4 expression, but downregulated miR-182-5p expression. We determined that miR-182-5p inhibited TLR4 by directly binding to its 3'-UTR. Furthermore, miR-182-5p suppressed the release of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1β. In vivo: A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was used to mimic cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Iba1 and TLR4 double staining was used to demonstrate that the target of miR-182-5p in microglial cells, and the mediator of the anti-inflammatory effect, is TLR4. TTC staining was performed to evaluate the infarct volume. Compared to the animals treated with miR-182-5p NC and normal saline, rats treated with miR-182-5p mimics demonstrated significantly enhanced neurological functions. TTC staining results were consistent with neurological function test findings. In summary, our data suggested that miR-182-5p exhibits potential neuroprotective effects in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via the regulation of the TLR4-mediated inflammatory response.

30236866|t|Discontinuing or continuing statin following intracerebral hemorrhage from the view of a national cohort study.
30236866|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Statins improve clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke but there is no evidence of the effect of continuing long-term statin therapy in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of continuing statin after ICH. METHODS: Data on patients with ICH was retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. The final population was separated into two groups according to those who continued and those who discontinued statin treatment. All-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes were analyzed after a 3 year follow-up after propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: Of the 114,101 patients with ICH, who were initially enrolled, 2468 patients with dyslipidemia and ICH were included. After PSM, the benefit of statin therapy on mortality appeared from 1 year to the end of the 3-year follow-up period after discharge (statin group versus non-statin group: 4.9% vs.12.3% at 1 year (hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.57) and 12.9% vs. 25.3% at the end of the 3 year follow-up period (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35-0.58). Compared with the patients using lipophilic statins, those using hydrophilic statins had a significantly lower incidence of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.43-0.99). There were no differences between those prescribed moderate-intensity statins and those prescribed high-intensity statins in terms of stroke and all-cause mortality (HR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.40-1.46). CONCLUSIONS: There was a lower risk of all-cause mortality following ICH in patients who continued statin treatment compared with those without statin treatment, especially in those treated with hydrophilic statins.

30052311|t|Knockdown of HIF-1α impairs post-ischemic vascular reconstruction in the brain via deficient homing and sprouting bmEPCs.
30052311|a|Although the critical role of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in cerebral neovascularization after stroke has been well characterized, the details regarding the regulation of endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-dependent neovascularization by HIF-1α are not completely understood. Using lentiviral shRNA to knockdown HIF-1α, we showed that HIF-1α plays a central role in bone marrow-derived EPC (bmEPC) homing and sprouting in the post-acute stage of ischemic Sprague Dawley (SD) rat brains. First, knockdown of HIF-1α decreased the homing of both endogenous and exogenous bmEPCs to the ischemic brain. Additionally, the knockdown impaired the incorporation and sprouting of bmEPCs in the ischemic brain. In vitro, knockdown of HIF-1α inhibited the spheroid sprouting and tube formation of bmEPCs. Mechanically, the HIF-1α-dependent recruitment of bmEPCs to the ischemic brain was relative to the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis and HMGB1, which were relative to astrocytes. In addition, the loss of HIF-1α resulted in deficient expression levels of VEGF-A, Flk-1, NRP1, and Dll4 in the ischemic brains, bmEPCs, and astrocytes. These findings suggested that HIF-1α implicates in bmEPC homing via CXCL12/CXCR4 and HMGB1 and that it promotes bmEPC sprouting via VEGF-A/flk1-NRP1/Dll4.

30536336|t|MiR-940 regulates angiogenesis after cerebral infarction through VEGF.
30536336|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether miR-490 was involved in the regulation of angiogenesis after cerebral infarction by regulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used to establish a middle cerebral artery infarction model. Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of miR-940 in serum and brain tissues at 1, 3, and 7 days after cerebral infarction. Meanwhile, miR-940 expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) after Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation (OGD) for 2, 4, 6 hours was measured by qRT-PCR, respectively. The cells were transfected with miR-940 mimics/inhibitor to achieve miR-940 overexpression or inhibition. Subsequently, the angiogenesis and proliferation ability of the cells was evaluated by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU) assay. Besides, the mRNA and protein expression levels of VEGF after miR-940 transfection were detected by Western blot and qRT-PCR, respectively. Finally, recovery experiment was used to determine whether miR-940 affected angiogenesis and proliferation of BMECs by regulating VEGF expression. RESULTS: The expression level of miR-940 in serum and brain tissues of rats was markedly decreased at 1, 3, and 7 days after cerebral infarction, which was then recovered on the 7th day. After 2, 4, and 6 hours of glucose and oxygen deprivation in BMECs, the expression level of miR-940 was significantly decreased. However, it was evidently recovered after 6 hours. After miR-940 over-expression in BMECs, the angiogenesis and proliferation of BMECs were remarkably inhibited. Conversely, miR-940 inhibitor transfection could significantly promote the formation of luminal cells and the proliferation of BMECs. QRT-PCR results showed that miR-940 overexpression down-regulated the expression level of VEGF, and the same findings were observed at the protein level. Further studies revealed that VEGF could reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-940 on lumen formation and cell proliferation in BMECs. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of miR-940 was downregulated in cerebral infarction. The low expression of miR-940 could promote the angiogenesis ability of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells after cerebral infarction, which might be resulted from the inhibitory effect of miR-940 on VEGF.

30043461|t|Selective role of Na+ /H+ exchanger in Cx3cr1+ microglial activation, white matter demyelination, and post-stroke function recovery.
30043461|a|Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHE1) activation is required for multiple microglial functions. We investigated effects of selective deletion of microglial Nhe1 in Cx3cr1-CreER ;Nhe1f/f mice on neuroinflammation and tissue repair after ischemic stroke. Infarct volume was similar in corn oil or tamoxifen (Tam)-treated mice at 48 hr and 14 days post-stroke. However, the Tam-treated mice showed significantly higher survival rate and faster neurological function recovery during day 1-14 post-stroke. Deletion of microglial Nhe1 prevented the elevation of CD11b+ /CD45low-med microglia in the ischemic hemisphere at day 3 post-stroke, but stimulated expression of Ym1, CD68, TGF-β, IL-10, decreased expression of CD86 and IL-1β, and reduced GFAP+ reactive astrocytes. Moreover, at day 14 post-stroke, enhanced white matter myelination was detected in the microglial Nhe1 deleted mice. In comparison, neuronal Nhe1-null mice (the CamKII-Cre+/- ;Nhe1f/f mice) showed a significant reduction in both acute and subacute infarct volume, along with increased survival rate and moderate neurological function recovery. However, these neuronal Nhe1-null mice did not exhibit reduced activation of CD11b+ /CD45low-med microglia or CD11b+ /CD45hi macrophages in the ischemic brains, and they exhibited no reductions in white matter lesions. Taken together, this study demonstrated that deletion of microglial and neuronal Nhe1 had differential effects on ischemic brain damage. Microglial NHE1 is involved in pro-inflammatory responses during post-stroke brain tissue repair. In contrast, neuronal NHE1 activation is directly associated with the acute ischemic neuronal injury but not inflammation. Our study reveals that NHE1 protein is a potential therapeutic target critical for differential regulation of ischemic neuronal injury, demyelination and tissue repair.

30508994|t|Recurrent Headache Increases Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability and VEGF Expression in Rats.
30508994|a|BACKGROUND: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important anatomical structure of the central nervous system (CNS) that limits the penetration of a variety of substances from the blood into the parenchyma. Dysfunction of the BBB is involved in various CNS disorders, including stroke, inflammation, and pain. However, the evidence concerning its role in migraine is insufficient. OBJECTIVE: This study will investigate whether recurrent headache increases BBB permeability and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in a rat model. STUDY DESIGN: This study used an experimental design. SETTING: The research took place in the Laboratory Research Center at The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. METHODS: Eighty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: inflammatory soup (IS), control (PBS), and treatment (IS+Sumatriptan) groups. Recurrent headache was induced by episodic IS stimulation: 20 µL of IS were pumped into the dura 3 times per week in rats. The control group was administered 20 µL of PBS. The rats in the treatment group were simultaneously treated with sumatriptan (300 ug/kg, intraperitoneal) at the same time that IS was applied to the dura. Mechanical nociceptive thresholds were examined by electronic von Frey filaments with rigid tips. BBB permeability changes were measured with Evans blue (EB). The expression of VEGF was measured by double labeling and Western blotting. RESULTS: After 4 IS applications, the mechanical nociceptive thresholds significantly decreased. In addition, the mechanical hypersensitivity persisted for 4 hours after 9 applications. Only after 9 applications did the BBB permeability increase, as demonstrated by the EB tracer. The BBB disruption was accompanied by an elevation in VEGF expression. Sumatriptan treatment significantly reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by IS stimulations and decreased the BBB disruption and VEGF expression. LIMITATIONS: Potential mechanisms that underlie the relationship between BBB and VEGF were not examined in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that repeated IS stimulations induced long-lasting allodynia, increased BBB permeability, and upregulated VEGF expression, all of which could be attenuated by early sumatriptan treatment. KEY WORDS: Migraine, inflammatory soup, blood-brain barrier, vascular endothelial growth factor, sumatriptan.

30420891|t|Chemical Profiling of Xueshuan Xinmaining Tablet by HPLC and UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF/MS.
30420891|a|Xueshuan Xinmaining Tablet (XXT) is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of stroke, chest pain, coronary heart disease, and angina pectoris caused by blood stasis. Having a multiple-component preparation, it is still far from meeting the requirements of modernization and standardization because its detailed chemical basis and action mechanism have not been clarified. In this work, the different batches of XXT samples were analyzed by HPLC and the typical sample was analyzed by UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF/MS to understand its chemical profiling. As a result, 77 chromatographic peaks were detected, among which 63 constituents were identified or tentatively characterized based on the comparison of retention time and UV spectra with authentic compounds as well as by summarized MS fragmentation rules and matching of empirical molecular formula with those of published components. This is the first systematic report on the chemical profiling of the commercial XXT products, which provides the sufficiently chemical evidence for the global quality evaluation of XXT products.

30386292|t|Assessing the Relationship Between Motor Anticipation and Cortical Excitability in Subacute Stroke Patients With Movement-Related Potentials.
30386292|a|Background: Stroke survivors may lack the cognitive ability to anticipate the required control for palmar grasp execution. The cortical mechanisms involved in motor anticipation of palmar grasp movement and its association with post-stroke hand function remains unknown. Aims: To investigate the cognitive anticipation process during a palmar grasp task in subacute stroke survivors and to compare with healthy individuals. The association between cortical excitability and hand function was also explored. Methods: Twenty-five participants with hemiparesis within 1-6 months after first unilateral stroke were recruited. Twenty-five matched healthy individuals were recruited as control. Contingent negative variation (CNV) was measured using electroencephalography recordings (EEG). Event related potentials were elicited by cue triggered hand movement paradigm. CNV onset time and amplitude between pre-cue and before movement execution were recorded. Results: The differences in CNV onset time and peak amplitude were statistically significant between the subacute stroke and control groups, with patients showing earlier onset time with increased amplitudes. However, there was no statistically significant difference in CNV onset time and peak amplitude between lesioned and non-lesioned hemisphere in the subacute stroke group. Low to moderate linear associations were observed between cortical excitability and hand function. Conclusions: The earlier CNV onset time and higher peak amplitude observed in the subacute stroke group suggest increased brain computational demand during palmar grasp task. The lack of difference in CNV amplitude between the lesioned and non-lesioned hemisphere within the subacute stroke group may suggest that the non-lesioned hemisphere plays a role in the motor anticipatory process. The moderate correlations suggested that hand function may be associated with cortical processing of motor anticipation.

30326892|t|Post-marketing safety surveillance and re-evaluation of Xueshuantong injection.
30326892|a|BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMIs) have been widely used to treat severe and acute diseases due to their high bioavailability, accurate curative effect, and rapid effect. However, incidence rates of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of TCMIs have also increased in recent years. Xueshuantong injection (XSTI) is a commonly-used TCMI comprised of Panax notoginseng total sapiens for the treatment of stroke hemiplegia, chest pain, and central retinal vein occlusion. Its safety remains uncelar. Therefore, post-marketing safety of XSTI was studied in this research. METHODS: In present study, post-marketing safety surveillance and re-evaluation of XSTI were reported. Thirty thousand eight hundred eighty-four patients in 33 hospitals from 7 provinces participated in this study. Incidence rate, most common clinical manifestations, types, severity, occurrence time, and disposal of ADRs were calculated. RESULTS: Incidence rate of ADR of XSTI was 4.14‰ and the most common clinical manifestations were skin and its appendages damage. Type A accounts for 95.49% of ADRs of XSTI and most of them (41.41%) were occurred within 24 h after receiving XSTI treatment. Severities of most ADRs of XSTI were moderate reactions (86.72%). Main disposition of ADRs of XSTI was drug withdrawal and symptomatic treatment (54.69%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide basis for improvement of instructions of XSTI and clinical safety of XSTI. Post-marketing surveillance of TCMIs in this study is a powerful tool to identify types and manifestations of ADRs to improve safety and effectiveness of drugs in clinical applications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This protocol has international registration in China clinical trial registration center ( ChiCTR~OPC~ 14,005,718 ) at December 22, 2014.

30386232|t|Anticancer Therapy-Induced Atrial Fibrillation: Electrophysiology and Related Mechanisms.
30386232|a|Some well-established immunotherapy, radiotherapy, postoperation, anticancer drugs such as anthracyclines, antimetabolites, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 blockers, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, alkylating agents, checkpoint inhibitors, and angiogenesis inhibitors, are significantly linked to cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity is a common complication of several cancer treatments. Some studies observed complications of cardiac arrhythmia associated with the treatment of cancer, including atrial fibrillation (AF), supraventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac repolarization abnormalities. AF increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; it is associated with an almost doubled risk of mortality and a nearly 5-fold increase in the risk of stroke. The occurrence of AF is also usually researched in patients with advanced cancer and those undergoing active cancer treatments. During cancer treatments, the incidence rate of AF affects the prognosis of tumor treatment and challenges the treatment strategy. The present article is mainly focused on the cardiotoxicity of cancer treatments. In our review, we discuss these anticancer therapies and how they induce AF and consequently provide information on the precaution of AF during cancer treatment.

30386260|t|Yi-nao-jie-yu Prescription Exerts a Positive Effect on Neurogenesis by Regulating Notch Signals in the Hippocampus of Post-stroke Depression Rats.
30386260|a|Post-stroke depression (PSD) is one of the most frequent complications of stroke. The Yi-nao-jie-yu prescription (YNJYP) is an herbal prescription widely used as a therapeutic agent against PSD in traditional Chinese medicine. Disruption of adult neurogenesis has attracted attention as a potential cause of cognitive pathophysiology in neurological and psychiatric disorders. The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in neurogenesis. This study investigated the effects of YNJYP on adult neurogenesis and explored its underlying molecular mechanism in a rat model of PSD that is established by middle cerebral artery occlusion and accompanied by chronic immobilization stress for 1 week. At 2, 4, and 8 weeks, depression-like behavior was evaluated by a forced swim test (FST) and sucrose consumption test (SCT). Neurogenesis was observed by double immunofluorescence staining. Notch signals were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results show that, at 4 weeks, the immobility time in the FST for rats in the PSD group increased and the sucrose preference in the SCT decreased compared with that in the stroke group. Therefore, YNJYP decreased the immobility time and increased the sucrose preference of the PSD rats. Further, PSD interfered with neurogenesis and decreased the differentiation toward neurons of newly born cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, and increased the differentiation toward astrocytes, effects that were reversed by YNJYP, particularly at 4 weeks. At 2 weeks, compared with the stroke group, expression of target gene Hes5 mRNA transcripts in the PSD group decreased, but increased after treatment with YNJYP. At 4 weeks, compared with the stroke group, the expression of Notch receptor Notch1 mRNA transcripts in the PSD group decreased, but also increased after treatment with YNJYP. Overall, this study indicated that disturbed nerve regeneration, including the increased numbers of astrocytes and decrease numbers of neurons, is a mechanism of PSD, and Notch signaling genes dynamically regulate neurogenesis. Moreover, YNJYP can relieve depressive behavior in PSD rats, and exerts a positive effect on neurogenesis by dynamically regulating the expression of Notch signaling genes.

30323946|t|Evaluation of a smartwatch-based intervention providing feedback of daily activity within a research-naive stroke ward: a pilot randomised controlled trial.
30323946|a|Background: The majority of stroke patients are inactive outside formal therapy sessions. Tailored activity feedback via a smartwatch has the potential to increase inpatient activity. The aim of the study was to identify the challenges and support needed by ward staff and researchers and to examine the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) using smartwatch activity monitors in research-naive rehabilitation wards. Objectives (Phase 1 and 2) were to report any challenges and support needed and determine the recruitment and retention rate, completion of outcome measures, smartwatch adherence rate, (Phase 2 only) readiness to randomise, adherence to protocol (intervention fidelity) and potential for effect. Methods: First admission, stroke patients (onset < 4 months) aged 40-75, able to walk 10 m prior to stroke and follow a two-stage command with sufficient cognition and vision (clinically judged) were recruited within the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Phase 1: a non-randomised observation phase (to allow practice of protocol)-patients received no activity feedback. Phase 2: a parallel single-blind pilot RCT. Patients were randomised into one of two groups: to receive daily activity feedback over a 9-h period or to receive no activity feedback. EQ-5D-5L, WHODAS and RMI were conducted at baseline, discharge and 3 months post-discharge. Descriptive statistics were performed on recruitment, retention, completion and activity counts as well as adherence to protocol. Results: Out of 470 ward admissions, 11% were recruited across the two phases, over a 30-week period. Retention rate at 3 months post-discharge was 48%. Twenty-two percent of patients dropped out post-baseline assessment, 78% completed baseline and discharge admissions, from which 62% were assessed 3 months post-discharge. Smartwatch data were received from all patients. Patients were correctly randomised into each RCT group. RCT adherence rate to wearing the smartwatch was 80%. Baseline activity was exceeded for 65% of days in the feedback group compared to 55% of days in the no feedback group. Conclusions: Delivery of a smartwatch RCT is feasible in a research-naive rehabilitation ward. However, frequent support and guidance of research-naive staff are required to ensure completeness of clinical assessment data and protocol adherence.

29776950|t|Clinical effects and safety of electroacupuncture for the treatment of post-stroke depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
29776950|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in the treatment of post-stroke depression (PSD). METHODS: A comprehensive literature search in the Pubmed, Embase, CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, CNKI and Wanfang databases was conducted, and all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool and Jadad score were used to assess the risk of bias of included studies, and only RCTs scoring ≥3 were included in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: 18 RCTs involving a total of 813 participants (mean age 61.6 years) in the EA groups and 723 participants (mean age 61.9 years) in the control groups were included. The included studies had an average 3 point Jadad score. PSD was diagnosed according to the Chinese Classification of Cerebrovascular Disease (CCCD) and the Chinese Classification of Mental Disease (CCMD) criteria. There was no significant difference between EA and antidepressants (fluoxetine 10-40 mg/day, citalopram 20 mg/day, sertraline 50 mg/day) in terms of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores at week 4 after treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.11, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.10), at week 6 after treatment (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.51) or at week 8 after treatment (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.22). However, the combined incidence of adverse events in the EA groups was significantly lower than in the antidepressant groups (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.33). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between EA and antidepressants in the severity of depression, however EA caused fewer adverse events than antidepressants. Additional larger scale RCTs with rigorous study design are required.

30212682|t|Treatment of atherosclerosis by traditional Chinese medicine: Questions and quandaries.
30212682|a|Atherosclerosis and its complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, are the major causes of morbidity and mortality, and development of effective therapies for both prevention and treatment of this disease is critically important. Currently, there are many drugs available for atherosclerotic disease, but the lipid-lowering drugs statins are still the first-choice for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. On the other hand, traditional Chinese medicines, mainly Chinese herbal medicines (CHM), have been widely used in China and in other Asian countries for the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases. Although many CHMs have been reported to be effective for treating atherosclerotic diseases for more than two thousand years, there are still many difficulties for their use, such as lack of scientific evidence assessed by rigorous clinical trials, complicated components and unclear pharmacological mechanisms, which often hamper the widespread use of CHMs in Western countries. Due to these concerns, CHMs are usually considered as complimentary or alternative treatment for atherosclerotic diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis viewed by Western and traditional Chinese medicine, summarize pros and cons on the efficacy of CHMs for atherosclerosis and discuss what is necessary for CHM use to spread to Western societies.

In this study, We preformed MCAO model in C57BL/6J wild-type (BDNK+/+) and BDNK knockout (BDNF-/-) mice respectively, and investigated the neuroprotective effect of Salidroside (Sal) and its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that Sal reversed brain infarct size, reduced cerebral edema, decreased the neurological deficit score and diminished TUNEL positive cells significantly. However, BDNK deficiency inhibited the neuroprotective effect of Sal. In addition, Sal increased cell viability, ameliorated neuron cell injury by decreasing LDH activity, and inhibited cell apoptotic rate. Sal suppressed apoptotic signaling via DNA-binding-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of Sal on BDNK was mediated by PI3K/Akt pathway, which was proved by the use of PI3K knockout (PI3K-/-) mice and siRNA-PI3K. In summary, these data strongly suggested that Sal could be used as an effective neuroprotective agent to protect against ischemic stroke after cerebral I/R injury through regulating BDNK-mediated PI3K/Akt apoptotic pathway in DNA-binding-dependent and -independent manners.

30693344|t|Effects of three flavonoids from an ancient traditional Chinese medicine Radix puerariae on geriatric diseases.
30693344|a|As the worldwide population ages, the morbidity of neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and endocrine diseases, such as diabetes and osteoporosis, continues to increase. The etiology of geriatric diseases is complex, involving the interaction of genes and the environment, which makes effective treatment challenging. Traditional Chinese medicine, unlike Western medicine, uses diverse bioactive ingredients to target multiple signaling pathways in geriatric diseases. Radix puerariae is one of the most widely used ancient traditional Chinese medicines and is also consumed as food. This review summarizes the evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies of the pharmacological effects of the main active components of the tuber of Radix puerariae on geriatric diseases.

30276773|t|[Exploring Resilience and Related Factors Among Patients With Stroke in the Recovery Stage].
30276773|a|BACKGROUND: Resilience is known to affect the degree to which individuals adapt to the impact of stroke and its sequelae. However, few studies have examined resilience and related factors among stroke patients in Taiwan. PURPOSE: To explore resilience and related factors among stroke patients in the recovery stage. METHODS: A cross-sectional and correlational study design was adopted. Convenience sampling was employed to recruit participants from the rehabilitation inpatient wards of a regional teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. A structured questionnaire, including the social support scale and the Chinese version of the resilience scale, was used for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics and stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 128 stroke recovery in-patients who averaged 57.2 ± 11.6 years of age and were predominantly male were recruited. The results of this study showed that the global resilience of participants was moderate and that a significantly positive correlation existed between global social support and resilience. Age, marital status, and global tangible social support accounted for 25.0% of the total variation in resilience. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Age, marital status and global tangible social support were identified as the crucial predictive factors of resilience in stroke patients. The results support the recommendation that healthcare providers should acquire advanced knowledge and skills through in-service education, proactive caring, and encouraging patients to learn self-care in order to enhance rehabilitation motivation and confidence levels and subsequently promote disease recovery and the ability to adapt to life through cross-disciplinary medical team cooperation and supportive relationships.

30030129|t|Ginkgolide B ameliorates NLRP3 inflammasome activation after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the neonatal male rat.
30030129|a|INTRODUCTION: Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult is an important cause of brain injury in neonates. The development of novel treatment strategies for neonates with HI brain injury is urgently needed. Ginkgolide B (GB) is a main component of Ginkgo biloba extracts with a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine. However, it is unknown whether GB could play a protective role in hypoxic stress in immature animals. METHODS: Using neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury model of rat pups, neurological score, infarct size, and brain edema were evaluated after HI injury. The activation of microglia and the production of IL-1β and IL-18 were detected by immunohistochemistry and ELISA, respectively. A priming signal (NF-κB P65) and an activation signal (Caspase-1) of NLRP3 inflammasome activation were detected by western blot analyses. RESULTS: GB administrated 30 min prior to ischemia induction can improve neurological disorder, reduce infarct volume and alleviate cerebral edema. Compared with the HI groups, GB inhibited the activation of microglia and decreased the production of IL-1β and IL-18 in neocortex. Furthermore, GB reduced NLRP3 expression mainly in microglia, and significantly inhibited the expression of Caspase-1 and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB P65, preventing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CONCLUSIONS: GB ameliorates hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the neonatal male rat via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

29219938|t|Correlations Among Self-Rated Health, Chronic Disease, and Healthcare Utilization in Widowed Older Adults in Taiwan.
29219938|a|BACKGROUND: Taiwan has a rapidly aging population. It is well known that older adults usually have worse health than younger adults, with widowed older adults at a particularly high risk of poor health. Widowed older adults experience the effects of bereavement, which affects their health. Therefore, health topics related to widowed older adults deserve special attention. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to discuss self-rated health for chronic diseases and healthcare utilization among widowed older adults. METHODS: A cross-section of data was used to analyze self-rated health-related issues. Data were adopted from the National Health Interview Survey in Taiwan, with the data on adults aged 65 years and over extracted and included in the assessment. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to investigate the relationships between healthcare utilization and self-rated health and chronic disease variables. RESULTS: The main empirical results show worse self-rated health status among widowed older adults in comparison with their nonwidowed peers and worse health status for widowers than widows. Next, age was negatively correlated with health rating, whereas a positive correlation with health was found for education. In addition, chronic diseases, particularly stroke, were found to be a significant predictive factor related to poor health status. Similar results were observed for healthcare utilization, apart from traditional Chinese medicine. Older adults who habitually purchased and used traditional Chinese medicine were shown to enjoy relatively better health statuses. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings identified that chronic diseases and healthcare utilization correlated strongly with self-rated health for widowed older adults. Therefore, self-rated health may be used as a screening tool by the National Health Insurance System in Taiwan, and the results may be referenced by public health officials who are responsible for developing welfare strategies to promote healthy aging among the widowed in Taiwan.

30220306|t|Electroacupuncture Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment and Spontaneous Low-Frequency Brain Activity in Rats with Ischemic Stroke.
30220306|a|BACKGROUND: To evaluate whether electroacupuncture (EA) at Baihui (DU20) and Shenting (DU24) acupoints could improve cognitive function and enhance spontaneous low-frequency brain activity in rats with ischemic stroke. METHODS: Total 36 rats were randomly divided into 3 groups-the sham surgery (Sham) group, the middle cerebral artery occlusion induced cognitive deficit (MICD) group, and the MICD with EA (MICD + EA) treatment group. The rats in MICD + EA group received EA treatment at DU20 and DU24 acupoints for 14 consecutive days after the surgery. The Morris water maze test was performed to assess the spatial learning and memory ability of the rats. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to investigate the infarction volume and spontaneous low-frequency brain activity of each group. RESULTS: After EA for 14 days, the learning and memory ability of the MICD rats was improved, and the brain infarction volume was reduced. Furthermore, basing on the fMRI amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) analysis, the decreased ALFF of the MICD rats was found in auditory cortex, cingulate gyrus, lateral nucleus group of dorsal thalamus, hippocampus, motor cortex, prelimbic cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and sensory cortex compared with the rats in sham group. However, these suppressive regions were notably attenuated after EA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that EA at DU20 and DU24 acupoints could ameliorate cognitive impairment in rats with ischemic stroke, and the protective effect of EA may attribute to reactivating the cognition-related brain regions, such as hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, cingulate gyrus, prelimbic cortex, and sensory cortex.

30136692|t|Motor imagery training induces changes in brain neural networks in stroke patients.
30136692|a|Motor imagery is the mental representation of an action without overt movement or muscle activation. However, the effects of motor imagery on stroke-induced hand dysfunction and brain neural networks are still unknown. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in the China Rehabilitation Research Center. Twenty stroke patients, including 13 males and 7 females, 32-51 years old, were recruited and randomly assigned to the traditional rehabilitation treatment group (PP group, n = 10) or the motor imagery training combined with traditional rehabilitation treatment group (MP group, n = 10). All patients received rehabilitation training once a day, 45 minutes per session, five times per week, for 4 consecutive weeks. In the MP group, motor imagery training was performed for 45 minutes after traditional rehabilitation training, daily. Action Research Arm Test and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity were used to evaluate hand functions before and after treatment. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to analyze motor evoked potentials in the affected extremity. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess changes in brain neural networks. Compared with the PP group, the MP group showed better recovery of hand function, higher amplitude of the motor evoked potential in the abductor pollicis brevis, greater fractional anisotropy of the right dorsal pathway, and an increase in the fractional anisotropy of the bilateral dorsal pathway. Our findings indicate that 4 weeks of motor imagery training combined with traditional rehabilitation treatment improves hand function in stroke patients by enhancing the dorsal pathway. This trial has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR-OCH-12002238).

30083891|t|Abnormal Metabolic Connectivity in Rats at the Acute Stage of Ischemic Stroke.
30083891|a|Stroke at the acute stage is a major cause of disability in adults, and is associated with dysfunction of brain networks. However, the mechanisms underlying changes in brain connectivity in stroke are far from fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated brain metabolism and metabolic connectivity in a rat ischemic stroke model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) at the acute stage using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Voxel-wise analysis showed decreased metabolism mainly in the ipsilesional hemisphere, and increased metabolism mainly in the contralesional cerebellum. We used further metabolic connectivity analysis to explore the brain metabolic network in MCAO. Compared to sham controls, rats with MCAO showed most significantly reduced nodal and local efficiency in the ipsilesional striatum. In addition, the MCAO group showed decreased metabolic central connection of the ipsilesional striatum with the ipsilesional cerebellum, ipsilesional hippocampus, and bilateral hypothalamus. Taken together, the present study demonstrated abnormal metabolic connectivity in rats at the acute stage of ischemic stroke, which might provide insight into clinical research.

30235876|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Radix Scrophulariae on Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury via MAPK Pathways.
30235876|a|Ischemic stroke is a clinically common cerebrovascular disease whose main risks include necrosis, apoptosis and cerebral infarction, all caused by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Ischemia and reperfusion-induced injury or apoptosis inhibition in human brain tissue may exert an irreplaceable protective effect on ischemic nerves. This process has particular significance for the treatment of stroke patients. However, the development of neuroprotective drugs remains challenging. Radix Scrophulariae, traditionally considered a valuable medicine, has been discovered to have neuroprotective effects. To explore the neuroprotective effects of an aqueous extract of Radix Scrophulariae (RSAE) on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and their underlying mechanisms, oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced PC12 cells were used, and a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) mouse model was established. In vitro results showed that 12.5 μg/mL RSAE markedly improved cell viability; inhibited LDH leakage; increased SOD, GSH-Px and CAT enzyme activity; stabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential; and reduced OGD-induced cell injury and apoptosis. Additionally, in vivo results preliminarily suggested that in MCAO/R model mice, RSAE treatments attenuated infarct volume; reduced brain water content and nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations; inhibited I/R-induced neurological deficits; reduced the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage release; improved antioxidant capacity by upregulating SOD, GSH-Px and CAT enzyme activity; and reduced neuronal apoptosis, necrosis and loss of neurons. Moreover, it was found that RSAE upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of Bax. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of MAPK signal pathways were elucidated via western blot analysis and immunohistochemical evaluation. In summary, this study investigated the neuroprotective effects and potential mechanisms of RSAE on focal cerebral I/R injury in mice. Radix Scrophulariae has been previously identified as a potential neuroprotective natural plant. Hence, our results may offer insight into discovering new active compounds or drugs for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Many new natural active chemicals in this extract may be discovered by chemical separation and identification and may provide new insights into therapeutic targets in stroke patients.

30223891|t|Cardiovascular and microvascular outcomes of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled cardiovascular outcome trials with trial sequential analysis.
30223891|a|BACKGROUND: Efficacy trials showed that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists reduced metabolic risk factors in addition to glucose lowering, but the cardiovascular and microvascular efficacy of this drug class remains to be determined. We aimed to evaluate the overall cardiovascular and microvascular efficacy of GLP1R agonists by performing a meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis. METHODS: Randomized controlled, cardiovascular outcomes trials including at least 2000 patient-years' follow-up and 100 composite cardiovascular events were included. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed and the quality of evidence was graded. RESULTS: Thirty-three thousand four hundred fifty-seven patients and 4105 cardiovascular events from 4 large trials were included. GLP1R agonists were associated with a statistically significant reduction in risks for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.95; number needed to treat [NNT]: 286 person-years), cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.96; NNT: 412 person-years), stroke (HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.98; NNT: 209 person-years) and the composite adverse cardiovascular outcome (MACE; HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.96; NNT: 241 person-years). The magnitude of benefit on MACE was attenuated in patients with a history of congestive heart failure (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.08 with; HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.00 without). The risks for hospitalization for heart failure and myocardial infarction were not significantly different. The quality of the evidence was deemed as moderate to high based on GRADE approach. TSA provided firm evidence for a 10% reduction in all-cause mortality, a 15% reduction in MACE, and lack of a 15% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure, but evidence remains inconclusive for cardiovascular mortality and myocardial infarction. GLP1R agonists numerically reduced the rates for nephropathy but the risk for retinopathy was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis suggested that GLP1R agonists significantly reduced the risk for all-cause mortality and composite cardiovascular outcomes, but the reduction of cardiovascular mortality remains to be confirmed.

30181378|t|Investigation of Renalase gene rs2576178 polymorphism in patients with coronary artery disease.
30181378|a|Renalase gene rs2576178 polymorphism has been demonstrated to be a risk factor of ischemic stroke, essential hypertension, and end-stage renal disease, but the association Renalase with risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) has been less reported. Therefore, we detected Renalase rs2576178 polymorphism in 449 CAD patients and 507 healthy controls using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization (MALDI)/time of flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry (MS). It was found that GG genotype or G allele of rs2576178 polymorphism was associated with the risk of CAD. Stratified analysis indicated that Renalase polymorphism significantly increased the risk of CAD in females, smokers, and alcoholics. However, there was no significant association between different genotypes of rs2576178 polymorphism and clinical parameters. In summary, Renalase rs2576178 polymorphism is associated with increased risk of CAD, but this finding should be confirmed by larger studies with more diverse ethnic populations.

30258350|t|Total Flavonoids in Caragana (TFC) Promotes Angiogenesis and Enhances Cerebral Perfusion in a Rat Model of Ischemic Stroke.
30258350|a|Previous studies have demonstrated that total flavonoid extracts from Caragana sinica (TFC) exert multiple therapeutic effects, promote blood flow, and exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The present study aimed to investigate whether TFC promotes angiogenesis and exerts neuroprotective effects in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Male Wistar rats were subjected to tMCAO for 1.5 h, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. TFC (15, 30, 60 mg/kg) was administered for 14 days. Evaluations of neurological function were performed following reperfusion, and infarct volumes were assessed in brain slices stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Our results indicated that TFC significantly attenuated cerebral infarct volume and neurological deficits following tMCAO. Laser Doppler, micro-PET/CT, and MRI analyses further demonstrated that TFC reduced infarct volume and enhanced cerebral blood flow in a dose-dependent manner, with the most significant effects occurring at a concentration of 60 mg/kg. Significant up-regulation of CD31, VEGF, Ang-1, HIF-1α, delta-like 4 (Dll4), and Notch1 expression was also observed in the experimental groups, relative to that in the vehicle group. In summary, the results of the present study indicate that TFC (15, 30, 60 mg/kg) attenuates neurological deficits, reduces infarct volume, and promotes angiogenesis following MCAO in a concentration-dependent manner, likely via increases in the expression of CD31, VEGF, Ang-1, HIF-1α, Dll4, and Notch1. Further studies are required to determine the clinical usefulness and potential mechanisms of TFC in patients with cerebral focal ischemic stroke.

30192890|t|Chinese herbal medicine reduced the risk of stroke in patients with Parkinson's disease: A population-based retrospective cohort study from Taiwan.
30192890|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a significantly increased risk of stroke. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has long been used in Asia to treat stroke, but there are no large-scale clinical data to confirm its efficacy in protecting PD patients against stroke. Herein, we analyzed a cohort of 1,000,000 records from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database for the period 1997-2011, and identified 1,882 patients with new-onset PD. We matched 290 patients who received Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) by age, sex, year of CHM prescription, and year of PD diagnosis with 290 patients who did not use CHM as control. Both cohorts were followed until the end of 2013 for the incidence of new-onset stroke. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for potential comorbidities, the incidence of stroke was lower among PD patients using CHM compared with non-CHM users (11.10 per 100 person-years vs 23.15 per 100 person-years; Hazard ratio: 0.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.44 to 0.72). The probability curve generated from our follow-up data showed that PD patients receiving CHM treatment had a decreased risk of stroke compared with those not receiving CHM treatment (P <0.001). The analysis on the prescription pattern of CHM revealed that Danshen is the most common single herb and Ma Zi Ren Wan is the most common herbal formula. Although the analysis are limited by a lack of analytic information regarding lifestyle patterns, biochemical profiles, and levels of PD severity in database, this population-based study suggest that CHM may be an complementary therapy to reduce the risk of stroke in PD patients.

30245755|t|Effects of Kudiezi Injection on Serum Inflammatory Biomarkers in Patients with Acute Cerebral Infarction.
30245755|a|Background: Kudiezi injection is a traditional Chinese medicine for acute cerebral infarction, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood. Objective: To investigate the mechanisms of Kudiezi injection on the inflammatory response in the treatment of acute cerebral infarction. Methods: This was a prospective study of patients with acute cerebral infarction within 48 h of onset and treated between July 2012 and July 2016 at three hospitals in China. The patients were randomized to routine treatments (control group) versus routine treatments and Kudiezi injection (Kudiezi group). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Score was assessed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14. The patients were tested for serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (S100 calcium-binding protein B, neuron-specific enolase, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interleukin-18, and matrix metaloproteinase-9; by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) immediately after admission and on days 3, 5, and 14. Results: Stroke scores were improved in both groups from days 1 to 14. On days 5 and 7, stroke scores in the Kudiezi group were lower than in the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with controls, the Kudiezi group had lower serum S100 calcium-binding protein B on day 14; higher interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 on day 3; lower interleukin-6 and interleukin-18 on day 5; and lower interleukin-18 and matrix metaloproteinase-9 on day 14. Conclusion: Kudiezi injection could lead to early reduction of interleukin-6, interleukin-18, matrix metaloproteinase-9, neuron-specific enolase, and S100 calcium-binding protein B levels and increases of interleukin-10 levels in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01636154.

29797810|t|Platelet Function Analyzer-200 P2Y Results Are Predictive of the Risk of Major Adverse Cardiac Events in Korean Patients Receiving Clopidogrel Therapy Following Acute Coronary Syndrome.
29797810|a|BACKGROUND: Clopidogrel is one of the most commonly used anti-platelet agents in cardiovascular diseases. We analyzed the relationship between the platelet function analyzer (PFA)-200 P2Y (INNOVANCE PFA-200 System, Siemens Healthcare, Germany) results and occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in Korean patients with recent-onset acute coronary syndrome (ACS) taking clopidogrel. METHODS: Between August 2013 and June 2016, we prospectively enrolled 106 patients with recent-onset ACS who had been treated with clopidogrel. We obtained blood samples and measured closure time (CT) using the PFA-200 P2Y test. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of a CT cut-off value of 106 seconds. We compared patient characteristics and various MACEs that occurred during the follow-up period. RESULTS: The CTs for 78 patients exceeded the cut-off value. At the time of these analyses, 11 patients had been diagnosed with MACEs. In the time-to-event analysis, there was a difference between the two groups (P<0.001). After adjusting other variables associated with MACE occurrence, CT value was the strongest predictor of MACEs, with a 7.30-fold occurrence risk (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong relationship between CT and MACE risk in Korean patients with recent-onset ACS taking clopidogrel. Accordingly, PFA-200 P2Y results could be used as a predictive marker for MACE risk in such patients.

30001637|t|Estimate of ischemic stroke prevalence according to a novel 4-tiered classification of left ventricular hypertrophy: insights from the general Chinese population.
30001637|a|BACKGROUND: Recently, a novel 4-tiered classification of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) based on ventricular dilatation (indexed LV end-diastolic volume [EDV]) and concentricity (mass/EDV0.67) has improved all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk stratification. However, their possible association with ischemic stroke has not been extensively evaluated in the general population. METHODS: We evaluated a cross-sectional study of 11,037 subjects from the general population of China in whom echocardiographic and ischemic stroke data were available to subdivide patients with LVH into four geometric patterns: indeterminate, dilated, thick and both thick and dilated hypertrophy. RESULTS: Compared with normal LV geometry, indeterminate and thick hypertrophy showed a higher prevalence of ischemic stroke (p < .05). Ischemic stroke was significantly greater in participants with indeterminate (adjusted odd ratio [OR]:1.635, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.115-2.398) and thick (2.143 [1.329-3.456]) hypertrophy but not significantly in those with dilated (1.251 [0.803-1.950]) and both thick and dilated hypertrophy (0.926 [0.435-1.971]) compared with normal geometry in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Indeterminate and thick hypertrophy were significantly associated with the presence of ischemic stroke in the general Chinese population. The new 4-tiered categorization of LVH can permit a better understanding of which subjects are at high enough risk for ischemic stroke to warrant early targeted therapy. Key messages This was the first study to investigate whether a 4-tiered classification of LVH defines subgroups in the general population that are at variable risks of ischemic stroke. We identified that thick hypertrophy carried the greatest odd for ischemic stroke, independently of traditional risk factors, followed by indeterminate hypertrophy. The new 4-tiered categorization of LVH emerged as a valuable operational approach, a potential alternative to LVM, to refine ischemic stroke stratification in general population.

29984733|t|Proteomic Analysis Reveals the Renoprotective Effect of Tribulus terrestris against Obesity-Related Glomerulopathy in Rats.
29984733|a|Tribulus terrestris L. (Zygophyllaceae) (TT) is usually used as a cardiotonic, diuretic, and aphrodisiac, as well as for herbal post-stroke rehabilitation in traditional Chinese medicine. However, little is known about the renoprotective effects of TT on obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG). In this study, 340 monomeric compounds were identified from TT extracts obtained with ethyl acetate combined with 50% methanol. In vitro, IC50 of TT was 912.01 mg/L, and the appropriate concentration of TT against oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) induced human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs) was 4 mg/L. TT significantly increased the viability (63.2%) and migration (2.33-fold increase) of HRGECs. ORG model rats were induced by a chronic high-fat diet (45%) for 20 weeks and were then treated with TT extract (2.8 g/kg/d) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, the kidneys were removed and their differentially expressed protein profile was identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF)-TOF MS. Molecular categorization and functional analysis of bioinformatic annotation suggested that excessive energy metabolism, decreased response to stress and low immunity were the potential etiologies of ORG. After TT administration for 8 weeks, body weight, blood pressure, serum cystatin C and cholesterol were decreased. Additionally, TT significantly enhanced the resistance of rats to ORG, decreased energy consumption and the hemorrhagic tendency, and improved the response to acute phase reactants and immunity. In conclusion, TT may play a protective role against ORG in rats.

29910216|t|Protective Effects of Shenfu Injection against Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via Activation of eNOS in Rats.
29910216|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of Shenfu injection (SFI) against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) in model rats and to explore its mechanism of action. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were pretreated with SFI and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) via tail vein injection and then rats were subjected to ischemia by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 120 min. Left ventricular function was evaluated by echocardiography. Hemodynamic was measured by the Millar pressure-volume system; serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum troponin (TNNI3) levels were determined. Myocardial infarct size was observed by 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining; p-Akt/Akt, and p-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS)/eNOS levels were assessed by Western blotting; nitric oxide (NO) content in serum was determined by the Griess reaction. SFI significantly decreased serum CK, LDH and TNNI3 levels in MIRI rats, while it significantly increased the level of left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular diastolic pressure (LVDP), maximal rate of the increase of left ventricular pressure (+dp/dtmax), maximal rate of the decrease of left ventricular pressure (-dp/dtmax), left ventricle ejection fraction percentage (EF), and stroke volume (SV). In addition, SFI significantly reduced myocardial infarction area and activated the phosphorylation of eNOS via Akt. The phosphorylation of eNOS and the concurrent increase of NO production contributed significantly to the protective effects of SFI. These results demonstrate that SFI protects the rat heart against MIRI and that this effect is mediated in part by Akt/eNOS signaling.

30186475|t|Percutaneous renal artery stent implantation in the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.
30186475|a|We aimed to investigate the clinical curative effect of percutaneous renal artery stent implantation (PTRAS) in the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS), and to analyze the factors influencing the curative effect of PTRAS. A total of 230 patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis were retrospectively analyzed. According to whether adverse cardiogenic or nephrogenic events occurred, 230 patients were divided into two groups to analyze the risk factors of adverse cardiogenic or nephrogenic events. The blood pressure of patients at each time-point after operation was decreased significantly compared with that before operation (P<0.01). The levels of serum creatinine (SCr) at 24 h and 36 months after PTRAS were slightly increased compared with that before operation (P>0.05). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at each time-point after operation was slightly decreased compared with that before operation, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Renography showed that GFR on the side of stent implantation at 36 months after PTRAS had no significant change compared with that before operation (P>0.05), but GFR on the unaffected side without receiving PTRAS was significantly increased compared with that before operation (P=0.0014). During the 36-month follow-up, there were a total of 56 cases of adverse cardiogenic or nephrogenic events. Multivariate regression analysis results showed that adverse cardiogenic or nephrogenic events after PTRAS were obviously associated with age (≥65 years old), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score (≥2 points), diabetes mellitus, stroke and congestive heart failure (CHF) (P<0.05). In conclusion, PTRAS can effectively control the blood pressure and reduce the types of antihypertensive drugs used by patients with ARAS, but it has no definitely protective effect on renal function. Age (≥65 years old), CCI score (≥2 points), diabetes mellitus, stroke and CHF are risk factors leading to adverse cardiogenic or nephrogenic events after PTRAS.

29943504|t|Salvia miltiorrhiza enhances the survival of mesenchymal stem cells under ischemic conditions.
29943504|a|OBJECTIVES: To validate the enhanced therapeutic effect of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (SM) for brain ischemic stroke through the anti-apoptotic and survival ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). METHODS: The viability and the expression level of cell apoptotic and survival-related proteins in MSCs by treatment of SM were assessed in vitro. In addition, the infarcted brain region and the behavioural changes after treatment of MSCs with SM were confirmed in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) models. KEY FINDINGS: We demonstrated that SM attenuates apoptosis and improves the cell viability of MSCs. In the rat MCAo model, the recovery of the infarcted region and positive changes of behaviour are observed after treatment of MSCs with SM. CONCLUSIONS: The therapy using SM enhances the therapeutic effect for brain ischemic stroke by promoting the survival of MSCs. This synergetic effect thereby proposes a new experimental approach of traditional Chinese medicine and stem cell-based therapies for patients suffering from a variety of diseases.

30129474|t|Traditional Chinese medicine for ischaemic stroke.
30278554|t|Effect of Tai Chi for post-stroke mental disorders and sleep disorders: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.
30278554|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke mental disorders (PSMDs) and post-stroke sleep disorders (PSSDs) are very common in stroke patients. Recently, Tai Chi (TC) as a form of Chinese traditional mind-body exercise has been gradually applied to stroke rehabilitation although its efficacy for PSMD and PSSD varies across different studies. The aim of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of TC training for PSMD and PSSD. METHODS: This review will only include randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Search strategy will be performed in 3 English databases, 4 Chinese databases, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. All English or Chinese RCTs, published from inception to February 28, 2019, will be sought. Two reviewers will screen, select studies, extract data, and assess quality independently. Primary outcomes are clinical scales, mainly including "Hamilton depression scale," "Hamilton anxiety scale," and "Pittsburgh sleep quality index." The methodological quality including the risk of bias of the included studies will be evaluated using a modified assessment form, which is based on Cochrane assessment tool and Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Review Manager Software (Revman5.3) will be used for heterogeneity assessment, generating funnel-plots, data synthesis, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis. We will use GRADE system to evaluate the quality of our evidence. RESULTS: We will provide some more practical and targeted results investigating the effect of TC exercise for PSMD and PSSD in the current meta-analysis. Meanwhile, we will ascertain study progress of TC for PSMD and PSSD and find out defects or inadequacies of previous studies, so that future researchers could get beneficial guidance for more rigorous study. CONCLUSION: The stronger evidence about TC's rehabilitative effect and safety for PSMD and PSSD will be provided for clinicians and policymakers. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42018106608. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We do not apply for formal ethical approval from ethics committee because all of the study data in our review will be obtained in an anonymous way. Findings of this study are projected to be disseminated through peer-review publications.

30031913|t|Dose-dependent target diversion of Danhong injection on the Glu-GLT-1/Gly-GlyRα dynamic balance module of cerebral ischemia.
30031913|a|Function-oriented modular structure analysis is a great challenge in module-based pharmacological studies. A strategy to uncover target-target interaction (TTI) and dynamic balance regularity (DBR) was established to discover the structural factors influencing modular functions and explore the mechanism of Danhong injection (DHI) in treating cerebral ischemia. The dose-related metabolic features of DHI intervention were investigated using metabolomics and modular pharmacology. The findings indicated that Glu/Gly was a biomarker and Glu-GLT-1/Gly-GlyRα was the core unit regulated by DHI. Gly and Glu displayed opposite patterns and functional roles, representing intra-modular balance. GlyRα was identified as the upstream target and GLT-1 as the downstream target by inhibiting or activating GlyRα, indicating that DHI has two dose-dependent regulatory modes. GlyRα was the major target at low doses, while GLT-1 was activated as the dominant target as doses accumulated. Our study reveals that target-target interaction and dynamic balance regularity are the key factors influencing modular functions, which is a promising breakthrough for module-based pharmacological studies.

30354988|t|Angioedema and Hemorrhage After 4.5-Hour tPA (Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator) Thrombolysis Ameliorated by T541 via Restoring Brain Microvascular Integrity.
30354988|a|Background and Purpose- tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) is the only recommended intravenous thrombolytic agent for ischemic stroke. However, its application is limited because of increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation beyond the time window. T541 is a Chinese compound medicine with potential to attenuate ischemia and reperfusion injury. This study was to explore whether T541-benefited subjects underwent tPA thrombolysis extending the time window. Methods- Male C57BL/6 N mice were subjected to carotid artery thrombosis by stimulation with 10% FeCl3 followed by 10 mg/kg tPA with/without 20 mg/kg T541 intervention at 4.5 hours. Thrombolysis and cerebral blood flow were observed dynamically until 24 hours after drug treatment. Neurological deficit scores, brain edema and hemorrhage, cerebral microvascular junctions and basement membrane proteins, and energy metabolism in cortex were assessed then. An in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation model using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells was used to evaluate effect of T541 on tight junctions and F-actin in the presence of tPA. Results- tPA administered at 4.5 hours after carotid thrombosis resulted in a decrease in thrombus area and survival rate, whereas no benefit on cerebral blood flow. Study at 24 hours after tPA administration revealed a significant angioedema and hemorrhage in the ischemia hemisphere, a decreased expression of junction proteins claudin-5, zonula occludens-1, occludin, junctional adhesion molecule-1 and vascular endothelial cadherin, and collagen IV and laminin. Meanwhile, ADP/ATP, AMP/ATP, and ATP5D (ATP synthase subunit) expression and activities of mitochondria complex I, II, and IV declined, whereas malondialdehyde and 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine increased and F-actin arrangement disordered. All the insults after tPA treatment were attenuated by addition of T541 dose dependently. Conclusions- The results suggest T541 as a potential remedy to attenuate delayed tPA-related angioedema and hemorrhage and extend time window for tPA treatment. The potential of T541 to upregulate energy metabolism and protect blood-brain barrier is likely attributable to its effects observed.

30347928|t|[Systematic review on efficacy and safety of Danshen Chuanxiongqin Injection in treatment of acute cerebral infarction].
30347928|a|To systemically evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of Danshen Chuanxiongqin Injection in treatment of acute cerebral infarction and provide the reference of evidence-based medicine for its clinical safety and effective drug use. Databases including CNKI, WanFang Data, SinoMed, the Cochrane Library, EMbase and PubMed were searched from inception to April 2018 to collect the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on Danshen Chuanxiongqin Injection in the treatment of acute cerebral infarction. The quality of all included studies was evaluated by two independent reviewers following the cochrane systematic review method and using Revman5.3 software and State13.0 for Meta-analysis. A total of 30 RCTs involving 3 233 patients with acute cerebral infarction were included in the study after literature quality evaluation. Meta-analysis showed that as compared with the control group of conventional western medicine alone, Danshen Chuanxiongqin Injection combined with conventional western medicine can achieve better efficacy in treatment of acute cerebral infarction, increase the clinical total effective rate (RR=1.22, 95% CI [1.18, 1.27], P<0.000 01) and activities of daily living (MD=9.42, 95% CI [8.12, 10.72], P<0.000 01), and improve the degree of neurological impairment (MD=-3.99, 95% CI [-4.89, -3.07], P<0.000 01). Furthermore, the result showed that Danshen Chuanxiongqin Injection in the treatment of acute cerebral infarction can significantly decrease the whole blood high-shear viscosity, whole blood low-shear viscosity, plasma viscosity, fibrinogen level and other hemorheological indexes (P<0.01). This Meta-analysis demonstrated that Danshen Chuan xiongqin injection in the treatment of acute cerebral infarction is safe and effective, but lacks the large multicenter clinical randomized trials to support the treatment outcome.

30006482|t|A preventive injection of endothelial progenitor cells prolongs lifespan in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.
30006482|a|There is a pressing need for new approaches to prevent stroke. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote vascular repair and revascularization in the ischemic brain. The present study sought to evaluate whether preventive delivery of EPCs could prevent or protect against stroke. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) received a single injection of EPCs, and their survival time was monitored. In addition, at 28 and/or 42 days after a single injection of EPCs, SHR-SP and mice were subjected to cerebral ischemia, and cerebral ischemic injury, local angiogenesis and in vivo EPC integration were determined. Other experiments examined the effects of EPC conditioned medium, and the distribution of donor EPCs taken from GFP transgenic mice. It was found that EPC-pretreated SHR-SP showed longer lifespans than untreated controls. A single preventive injection of EPCs could produce persistent protective effects against cerebral ischemic injury (lasting at least 42 days), and promote local angiogenesis in the ischemic brain, in two types of animals (SHR-SP and normotensive mice). EPCs of donor origin could be detected in the recipient peripheral blood, and integrated into the recipient ischemic brains. Furthermore, it was suggested that mouse EPCs might exert paracrine effects on cerebral ischemic injury in addition to their direct angiogenic effects. In conclusion, a single preventive injection of EPCs prolonged the lifespan of SHR-SP, and protected against cerebral ischemic injury for at least 7 weeks. It is implied that EPC injection might be a promising candidate for a preventive role in patients at high risk for stroke.

30134942|t|Effect of acupuncture for constipation after ischemic stroke: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
30134942|a|BACKGROUND: Constipation is a common complication after stroke that can severely influence a patient's quality of life and rehabilitation. Treatments for constipation after stroke vary. Acupuncture may improve spontaneous bowel movements, quality of life, and clinical symptoms. The study seeks to assess the preliminary effects of acupuncture on constipation after an ischemic stroke. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective randomized controlled pilot trial design in which 120 eligible patients will be randomly allocated to one of three groups. The acupuncture group (n = 40) will receive acupuncture and routine care, the medication group (n = 40) will receive mosapride citrate and routine care, and the control group (n = 40) will receive only routine care for ischemic stroke. Patients will be recruited 2 weeks to 6 months after stroke onset and will receive the intervention continuously over 4 weeks, with a follow-up period of 4 additional weeks. Adverse events will be recorded to assess the safety and tolerability of acupuncture for constipation after an ischemic stroke. The primary outcome will be the change in the weekly mean number of complete spontaneous bowel movements. Secondary outcomes will include any change in the weekly mean number of spontaneous bowel movements, mean stool consistency scores, mean straining scores during defecation, and frequency of laxative use. All outcome measures will be assessed at inception, after the intervention (4 weeks), and at the follow-up (8 weeks). DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence of the preliminary effects and inform future sample size calculations for studies of acupuncture for constipation following an ischemic stroke. These findings will inform subsequent large-scale randomized controlled trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, 22214747 . Registered on 17 August 2015.

30158850|t|A Novel Tetramethylpyrazine Derivative Protects Against Glutamate-Induced Cytotoxicity Through PGC1α/Nrf2 and PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathways.
30158850|a|Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity is one of the main causes of neuronal cell death in stroke. Compound 22a has been previously reported as a promising neuroprotective compound derived from tetramethylpyrazine, which is a widely used active ingredient of traditional Chinese medicine Chuanxiong (Ligusticum wallichii Franchat). Compound 22a can protect neurons from oxidative stress-induced PC12 cell death and alleviates the infarct areas and brain edema in a rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model. In the current work, we further investigated the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of compound 22a against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in primary culture of rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). We found that pretreatment with compound 22a prevented glutamate-induced neuronal damage by maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and attenuating cellular apoptosis. Compound 22a could also enhance peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) transcriptional activity and induce nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in PC12 cells. Accordingly, pretreatment with compound 22a reversed the glutamate-induced down-regulation of expression of the proteins PGC1α, transcriptional factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and hemooxygenase 1 (HO-1). In addition, compound 22a increased the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (p-GSK3β). Meanwhile, the small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of PGC1α expression and selective inhibitors targeting PI3K/Akt (LY294002 and Akt-iv) could significantly attenuate the neuroprotective effect of compound 22a. Taken together, compound 22a protected against glutamate-induced CGN injury possibly in part through regulation of PGC1α/Nrf2 and PI3K/Akt pathways.

29758340|t|Traditional Mongolian medicine Eerdun Wurile improves stroke recovery through regulation of gene expression in rat brain.
29758340|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eerdun Wurile (EW) is one of the key Mongolian medicines for treatment of neurological and cardiological disorders. EW is ranked most regularly used Mongolian medicine in clinic. Components of EW which mainly originate from natural products are well defined and are unique to Mongolian medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: Although the recipe of EW contains known neuroactive chemicals originated from plants, its mechanism of action has never been elucidated at molecular level. The objective of the present study is to explore the mechanism of neuroregenerative activity of EW by focusing on the regulation of gene expression in the brain of rat model of stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models were treated with EW for 15 days. Then, total RNAs from the cerebral cortex of rat MCAO models treated with either EW or control (saline) were extracted and analyzed by transcriptome sequencing. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for their functions during the recovery of ischemic stroke. The expression level of significantly differentially expressed genes such as growth factors, microglia markers and secretive enzymes in the lesion was further validated by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Previously identified neuroactive compounds, such as geniposide (Yu et al., 2009), myristicin (Shin et al., 1988), costunolide (Okugawa et al., 1996), toosendanin (Shi and Chen, 1999) were detected in EW formulation. Bederson scale indicated that the treatment of rat MCAO models with EW showed significantly lowered neurological deficits (p < 0.01). The regional cerebral blood circulation was also remarkably higher in rat MCAO models treated with EW compared to the control group. A total of 186 genes were upregulated in the lesion of rat MCAO models treated with EW compared to control group. Among them, growth factors such as Igf1 (p < 0.05), Igf2 (p < 0.01), Grn (p < 0.01) were significantly upregulated in brain after treatment of rat MCAO models with EW. Meanwhile, greatly enhanced expression of microglia markers, as well as complementary components and secretive proteases were also detected. CONCLUSION: Our data collectively indicated that EW enhances expression of growth factors including Igf1 and Igf2 in neurons and microglia, and may stimulate microglia polarization in the brain. The consequences of such activity include stimulation of neuron growth, hydrolysis and clearance of cell debris at the lesion, as well as the angiogenesis.

30158991|t|Xingnaojing Injection Protects against Cerebral Ischemia Reperfusion Injury via PI3K/Akt-Mediated eNOS Phosphorylation.
30158991|a|Xingnaojing (XNJ) injection, derived from traditional Chinese medicine formulation, has a protective effect against stroke, but the underlying mechanism is unclear, which severely limited its clinical application. This research aims to elucidate the role and mechanism of XNJ in reducing cerebral ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury. Rats received 2 h cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion of 24 h and were intraperitoneally given 5, 10, or 15 ml/kg XNJ 24 h before ischemia and at the onset of reperfusion, respectively. TTC staining, HE staining, and neurological score were implied to evaluate the effectiveness of XNJ. The protein expressions of PI3K/Akt and eNOS signaling were measured. Experiments were further performed in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) to investigate the protective mechanisms of XNJ. HBMECs were subjected to 3 h oxygen and glucose deprivation following 24 h of reoxygenation (OGD) to mimic cerebral I/R in vitro. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was added with or without the preconditioning of XNJ. Multiple methods including western blot, immunofluorescence, DAPI staining, JC-1, and flow cytometry were carried out to evaluate the effect of XNJ on HBMECs. XNJ could improve rat cerebral ischemic injury and OGD induced HBMECs apoptosis. In vivo and in vitro researches indicated that the mechanism might be relevant to the activation of PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling.

29661589|t|Challenges and research progress of the use of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of ischemic stroke.
29661589|a|Cerebral Ischemic Stroke (CIS) has become a hot issue in medical research because of the diversity of risk factors and the uncertainty of prognosis. In the field of regenerative medicine, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have an increasingly prominent position due to their advantages of multiple differentiation, low immunogenicity and wide application. In the basic and clinical research of CIS, there are still some problems to be solved in the treatment of CIS. This paper will discuss the progresses and some obstacles of current MSCs for the treatment of CIS.

30906928|t|Is there a central role for the cerebral endothelium and the vasculature in the brain response to conditioning stimuli?
30906928|a|A variety of conditioning stimuli (e.g. ischemia or hypoxia) can protect against stroke-induced brain injury. While most attention has focused on the effects of conditioning on parenchymal injury, there is considerable evidence that such stimuli also protect the cerebrovasculature, including the blood-brain barrier. This review summarizes the data on the cerebrovascular effects of ischemic/hypoxic pre-, per- and post-conditioning and the mechanisms involved in protection. It also addresses some important questions: Are the cerebrovascular effects of conditioning just secondary to reduced parenchymal injury? How central is endothelial conditioning to overall brain protection? For example, is endothelial conditioning sufficient or necessary for the induction of brain protection against stroke? Is the endothelium crucial as a sensor/transducer of conditioning stimuli?

30092118|t|Metabolomic study for essential hypertension patients based on dried blood spot mass spectrometry approach.
30092118|a|Hypertension is an increasingly serious public-health challenge worldwide. The traditional blood pressure measurement method could easily and reliably detect blood pressure. However, the delayed symptom onset may influence the screening of essential hypertension (EH). In addition, EH is significantly associated to cardiovascular disease, stroke and kidney disease. Hence, it is urgent to define associated biomarkers with early diagnosis potential for EH. A dried blood spot method integrated with direct infusion mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomic analysis was applied for the detection of metabolites toward 87 EH patients and 91 healthy controls (HC). Multiple algorithms were run on training set (62 EH and 64 HC) for selecting differential metabolites as potential biomarkers. A test set (25 EH and 27 HC) was used to verify and evaluate selected potential biomarkers. A novel blood biomarker model based on Gly, Orn, C10, Orn/Cit, Phe/Tyr, and C5-OH/C8 exhibited potential to differentiate EH patients from HC individuals, with a sensitivity of 0.8400 and a specificity of 0.8889 in test set. The metabolomic analysis of EH is beneficial to the definition of disease-associated biomarkers and the development of new diagnostic approaches. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(8):777-785, 2018.

29894444|t|Uncertainty of Acute Stroke Patients: A Cross-sectional Descriptive and Correlational Study.
29894444|a|BACKGROUND: Uncertainty is a chronic and pervasive source of psychological distress for patients and plays an important role in the rehabilitation of stroke survivors. Little is known about the level and correlates of uncertainty among patients in the acute phase of stroke. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to describe the uncertainty of patients in the acute phase of stroke and to explore characteristics of patients associated with that uncertainty. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive and correlational study was conducted with a convenience sample of 451 consecutive hospitalized acute stroke patients recruited from the neurology department of 2 general hospitals of China. Uncertainty was measured using Chinese versions of Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale for Adults on the fourth day of patients' admission. RESULTS: The patients had moderately high Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale for Adults scores (mean [SD], 74.37 [9.22]) in the acute phase of stroke. A total of 95.2% and 2.9% of patients were in moderate and high levels of uncertainty, respectively. The mean (SD) score of ambiguity (3.05 [0.39]) was higher than that of complexity (2.88 [0.52]). Each of the following characteristics was independently associated with greater uncertainty: functional status (P = .000), suffering from other chronic diseases (P = .000), time since the first-ever stroke (P = .000), self-evaluated economic pressure (P = .000), family monthly income (P = .001), educational level (P = .006), and self-evaluated severity of disease (P = .000). CONCLUSION: Patients experienced persistently, moderately high uncertainty in the acute phase of stroke. Ameliorating uncertainty should be an integral part of the rehabilitation program. Better understanding of uncertainty and its associated characteristics may help nurses identify patients at the highest risk who may benefit from targeted interventions.

30075561|t|Acupuncture for balance dysfunction in patients with stroke: A systematic review protocol.
30075561|a|BACKGROUND: Balance dysfunctions in stroke survivors are common and have significant impact on functional independence and rehabilitation. As a crucial technique of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture has been used widely for balance dysfunctions after stroke, although its effective evidence is not clear. Hence, we plan this systematic review protocol to evaluate the value of its efficacy and safety for balance dysfunctions after stroke. METHODS: We will search the databases from the publishment to April 2018: Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, EBASE, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Wanfang, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. The clinical efficacy will be accepted as the primary outcomes. RevMan V.5.3 software will be used to compute the data synthesis when a meta-analysis is allowed. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide a high-quality synthesis of current evidence of acupuncture for balance dysfunctions after stroke including clinical efficacy, balance ability, walking ability, and activity of daily life etcetera. CONCLUSION: This protocol will determine whether acupuncture is an effective and safety intervention for balance dysfunctions after stroke.

30106053|t|Gualou Guizhi decoction promotes neurological functional recovery and neurogenesis following focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
30106053|a|Recovery following stroke involves neurogenesis and axonal remodeling within the ischemic brain. Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) is a Chinese traditional medicine used for the treatment of post-stroke limb spasm. GLGZD has been reported to have neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemic injury. However, the effects of GLGZD on neurogenesis and axonal remodeling following cerebral ischemia remain unknown. In this study, a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurological function was assessed immediately after reperfusion using Longa's 5-point scoring system. The rats were randomly divided into vehicle and GLGZD groups. Rats in the sham group were given sham operation. The rats in the GLGZD group were intragastrically administered GLGZD, once daily, for 14 consecutive days. The rats in the vehicle and sham groups were intragastrically administered distilled water. Modified neurological severity score test, balance beam test and foot fault test were used to assess motor functional changes. Nissl staining was performed to evaluate histopathological changes in the brain. Immunofluorescence staining was used to examine cell proliferation using the marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) as well as expression of the neural precursor marker doublecortin (DCX), the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the axon regeneration marker growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43). GLGZD substantially mitigated pathological injury, increased the number of BrdU, DCX and GFAP-immunoreactive cells in the subventricular zone of the ischemic hemisphere, increased GAP-43 expression in the cortical peri-infarct region, and improved motor function. These findings suggest that GLGZD promotes neurological functional recovery by increasing cell proliferation, enhancing axonal regeneration, and increasing the numbers of neuronal precursors and astrocytes in the peri-infarct area.

29777774|t|MiR-125b-5p is involved in oxygen and glucose deprivation injury in PC-12 cells via CBS/H2S pathway.
29777774|a|AIMS: Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be implicated in cerebral hypoxia injury and could serve as a therapeutic target. As the third gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a critical role in hypoxia-induced injury in the central nervous system. Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is the main enzyme catalyzing the production of H2S in brain. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-125b-5p on protecting against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) injury in PC-12 cells by regulating CBS and H2S generation. RESULTS: The level of miR-125b-5p was increased in the rat MCAO model as well as OGD model in PC-12 cells. Meanwhile, CBS expression was remarkably downregulated. Overexpression of miR-125b-5p reduced CBS expression, decreased the H2S generation, and deteriorated OGD injury in PC-12 cells. On the contrary, silencing miR-125b-5p protected PC-12 cells from OGD injury by upregulated CBS and H2S levels. We found the protective effect of miR-125b-5p inhibition was associated with anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic cell signaling through decreasing ROS level and reducing mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Furthermore, the protective effect was absent when CBS was knockdown in PC-12 cells. INNOVATION AND CONCLUSION: Our research discovered the regulation of CBS by miR-125b-5p. Besides, we provide the evidence for the therapeutic potential of miR-125b-5p inhibition for cerebral ischemia via CBS/H2S pathway.

29360539|t|Discovery of Leonuri and therapeutical applications: From bench to bedside.
29360539|a|Despite several advances in percutaneous coronary intervention and the discovery of new drugs, the incidence of myocardial infarction and deaths due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has not decreased markedly in China. The quality of life is affected seriously, which further results in great social and family burden. Many drugs, from the century-old aspirin to the newly FDA-approved Byvalson, have been proven to be effective in the treatment and prevention of CVD. As clinically reported, those life-saving drugs still have their side effects in regards to the narrow therapeutic indexes influenced by individual genetic variations. Herba Leonuri, also known as Chinese Motherwort, which are naturally present in plants and traditionally are used for the uterotonic action, postpartum blood stasis, breast pain as well as other gynecological disorders in China for thousands of years. Since the last two decades, our group has reported leonurine, a unique alkaloid found in Herba Leonuri, exhibits various bioactivities such as antioxidant, anti-apoptotic effects, free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory effects, in addition to improving micro-circulation. These bioactivities are related to the underlying mechanisms of ischemic heart diseases and cardiac fibrosis. Pharmacological studies have proven leonurine to be effective in treating CVD in various ways, particularly ischemic heart diseases. Besides the cardio protective effects, which are similar in the central nervous system, more specifically, inhibited mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production together with the restored mitochondrial function and redox state were observed in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats by leonurine treatment, which strongly reveals its neuroprotective effects and carries a therapeutic potential for recovery and prevention of stroke. Based on their mode of action, we propose that leonurine can be developed as drugs to treat ischemic heart diseases. Taking advantage of the most recent findings in pharmacological research including the effects of low toxicity and good pharmacokinetics characteristics, leonurine has a very attractive prospect of clinical application. Our recent promising pharmacological results may be able to eradicate the barrier hindering its sale on market. In sum, from bench to bedside is no longer a long way for leonurine.

30140296|t|The Effect of Naoxintong Capsule in the Treatment of Patients with Cerebral Infarction and Carotid Atherosclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.
30140296|a|Objective: Naoxintong capsule (NXT) has been widely used to treat patients with cerebral infarction and carotid atherosclerosis. However, it is uncertain whether there is robust evidence on the effects of NXT for cerebral infarction and carotid atherosclerosis. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials were performed to assess the efficacy of NXT in the treatment of cerebral infarction and carotid atherosclerosis. Methods: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, the Medline database, the Wanfang database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the VIP database were searched up to January 2018 with no language restrictions. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were performed according to the Cochrane standards. Results: Eleven studies (N=1141) in total satisfied the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The results of meta-analysis showed that compared with the conventional therapy alone, NXT combined with conventional therapy could significantly improve national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS) score (MD= -3.92, 95%CI: -4.31~-3.52, P<0.00001), plaque area (MD= -0.16, 95%CI: -0.20~-0.13, P<0.00001), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) (MD= -0.23, 95%CI: -0.26~-0.20, P<0.00001), total cholesterol (TC) (MD= -0.16, 95%CI: -0.79~-0.42, P<0.00001), triglyceride (TG) (MD= -0.69, 95%CI: -0.88~-0.51, P<0.00001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MD= 0.23, 95%CI: 0.15~0.31, P<0.00001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (MD= -0.42, 95%CI: -0.58~-0.25, P<0.00001). There were no reported adverse events in the studies. Conclusions: NXT is an effective and safe therapy option for patients with cerebral infarction and carotid atherosclerosis. However, due to the high clinical heterogeneity and small sample size of the included trials, further standardized preparation, large-scale and rigorously designed trials are needed.

30039808|t|Differential and Predictive Value of Galectin-3 and Soluble Suppression of Tumorigenicity-2 (sST2) in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.
30039808|a|BACKGROUND Galectin-3 and soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 (sST2) are promising biomarkers of cardiac fibrosis and ventricular remodeling. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic and predictive value of galectin-3 and sST2 for use in patients who have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 217 hospitalized patients with HF and 30 controls from a physical examination center were included. Venous blood was collected for the detection of circulating expression of galectin-3 and sST2. All the included patients were followed up regularly for 1 year (12±1 months). RESULTS The concentrations of galectin-3 and NT-proBNP were substantially higher following decreased ejection fraction (both P=0.000), except for sST2 (P=0.068 vs. control). In ROC analyses, galectin-3 and NT-proBNP distinguished HFpEF from controls with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.819 (95% CI: 0.75-0.89, P=0.000) and 0.806 (95% CI: 0.66-0.82, P=0.000). In contrast, sST2 obtained a lower AUC of 0.584 (95% CI: 0.49-0.68, P=0.17) compared to galectni-3 and NT-proBNP. After adjustment for clinical factors and NT-proBNP, galectin-3 was strongly correlated with an increased risk of the endpoint events in HFpEF patients, and the hazard ratio per 1 SD increase of the galectin-3 level was 2.33 (95%CI: 1.72-2.94, P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS Galectin-3 is superior to sST2 in distinguishing HFpEF from controls and HFrEF.

30079027|t|Treatment of Naoxueshu Promotes Improvement of Hematoma Absorption and Neurological Function in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage Patients.
30079027|a|Aims: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Naoxueshu oral liquid in the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients. Methods: In our study, December 2008 to August 2010, 88 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were enrolled and 87 patients with complete information of whom 44 patients received Naoxueshu oral liquid plus regular treatment (Naoxueshu group), 43 patients received regular treatment (control group) only. Naoxueshu oral liquid 10 ml was taken in the Naoxueshu group, with 3 times a day for 21 consecutive days. The regular treatment included (1) dehydration treatment by 20% mannitol; (2) therapy to deal with complications including; (3) supportive therapy. The general clinical information, neurological assessment information, laboratory information, and the hematoma volume information were collected and analyzed pre-and post-treatment. Results: We did not find differences in the information between two groups before treatment (p > 0.05). 21-day after treatment, the white blood cell (WBC) count, hematoma volume, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel index (BI), and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome score in the Naoxueshu group and control group were significantly decreased than before (pnaoxueshu < 0.01, pcontrol < 0.05), and the changes of the WBC count, hematoma volume, NIHSS score, mRS score, and TCM syndrome score in Naoxueshu group were greater than that of control group (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Naoxueshu oral liquid plus regular treatment could decrease the inflammatory response and hematoma, and improve outcomes of ICH patients than regular treatment only. This suggests that Maixueshu oral liquid is a potential treatment for ICH patients.

30065639|t|Mutual Information-Based Brain Network Analysis in Post-stroke Patients With Different Levels of Depression.
30065639|a|Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common stroke-related emotional disorder, and it severely affects the recovery process. However, more than half cases are not correctly diagnosed. This study was designed to develop a new method to assess PSD using EEG signal to analyze the specificity of PSD patients' brain network. We have 107 subjects attended in this study (72 stabilized stroke survivors and 35 non-depressed healthy subjects). A Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score was determined for all subjects before EEG data collection. According to HDRS score, the 72 patients were divided into 3 groups: post-stroke non-depression (PSND), post-stroke mild depression (PSMD) and post-stroke depression (PSD). Mutual information (MI)-based graph theory was used to analyze brain network connectivity. Statistical analysis of brain network characteristics was made with a threshold of 10-30% of the strongest MIs. The results showed significant weakened interhemispheric connections and lower clustering coefficient in post-stroke depressed patients compared to those in healthy controls. Stroke patients showed a decreasing trend in the connection between the parietal-occipital and the frontal area as the severity of the depression increased. PSD subjects showed abnormal brain network connectivity and network features based on EEG, suggesting that MI-based brain network may have the potential to assess the severity of depression post stroke.

30018228|t|Preparation, Characterization, Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution of Baicalin-Loaded Liposome on Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion after i.v. Administration in Rats.
30018228|a|The dry root of Scutellaria baicalensis, has traditionally been applied in the treatment of cerebral ischemia in Chinese clinics. Baicalin (BA) is considered the key ingredient in it for the brain protection effects. The bioavailability of BA is very low because of its poor lipid and water solubility, which limits the therapeutic effects and clinical application. The aim of the present study was to develop a novel BA-loaded liposome (BA-LP) formulation to improve the drug lipophilicity and further to enhance the drug-concentration in the brain tissues. This study is also designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of BA in the pathological conditions of stroke and evaluate the pharmacokinetic differences of BA caused by stroke after intravenous administration with BA and BA-LP. In this study, the novel BA-LP prepared in early stage were characterized by morphology, size, zeta potential, encapsulation rate and the in vitro release. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of BA and BA-LP were investigated by intravenous administration in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and normal group respectively. BA-LP had a mean particle size of 160⁻190 nm, zeta potential of -5.7 mV, and encapsulation efficiency of 42 ± 1%. The BA-LP showed a sustained-release behavior, the in vitro drug-release kinetic model of BA-LP fit well with the biphasic dynamic model equation: Q = 1 - (60.12e0.56t - 59.08e0.0014t). Pharmacokinetic behavior in MCAO rats is not consistent with that of normal rats. The middle cerebral artery occlusion rats got higher Cmax and AUC0⁻t, which were about 1.5⁻2 times to normal rats both in BA and liposome groups. In addition, it got especially higher distribution in brain, while BA were not detected in brain tissues on normal rats. The Cmax and AUC0⁻t values were significantly greater with liposome than BA on both normal and MCAO rats. The tissue distribution behavior was significantly altered in the case of liposome administrated in comparison with BA, which the concentrations in the heart, liver, spleen, lungs and brain were all increased after administrated liposome, but decreased in kidneys. The TI values showed that the target of liposome was improved especially to heart, spleen and brain, and the brain's target was higher in striatum and cerebellum. In conclusion, BA-LP might be a potential drug delivery system to improve the therapeutic efficacy of BA. In addition, these results also suggest that the pathological damages of ischemia-reperfusion have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetic traits of BA.

30112417|t|iTRAQ-Based Proteomics Analysis Reveals the Effect of Rhubarb in Rats with Ischemic Stroke.
30112417|a|Background. Rhubarb, a traditional Chinese medicine, promotes viscera and remove blood stasis. Rhubarb is skilled in smoothening meridians, improving blood circulation which exhibits better efficacy on cerebral ischemic stroke. In this study, we aimed to analyze the underlying mechanisms of rhubarb which treated rats of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model according to an iTRAQ-based proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. 30 rats were randomly allocated into three groups including sham group (SG), model group (MG), and rhubarb group (RG). Rhubarb group was given a gavage of rhubarb decoction at dose of 3 g/kg and the remaining groups were prepared with normal saline by gavage. Rats from MG and RG were induced into MCAO model. The effects of rhubarb were estimated by Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) and cerebral infarct volume. The brain tissues were measured via the quantitative proteomic approach of iTRAQ coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Furthermore, the bioinformatics analysis of overlapping differentially expression proteins (DEPs) was conducted by DAVID, KEGG, and Cytoscape. Specific selective DEPs were validated by Western blotting. Rats treated with rhubarb after MCAO showed a significant reduction on mNSS and cerebral infarct volume compared with MG. In MG versus SG and RG versus MG, we identified a total of 4578 proteins, of which 287 were DEPs. There were 76 overlapping DEPs between MG versus SG and RG versus MG. Through bioinformatics analysis, 14 associated pathways were searched including cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, tuberculosis, synaptic vesicle cycle, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, long-term potentiation, and so on. 76 overlapping DEPs mainly involved synaptic vesicle cycling biological processes based on GO annotation. Further, the selective overlapping DEPs were verified at the protein level by using Western blotting. Our present study reveals that rhubarb highlights promising neuroprotective effect. Rhubarb exerts novel therapeutic action via modulating multiple proteins, targets, and pathways.

29729639|t|Method development and application for multi-component quantification in rats after oral administration of Longxuetongluo Capsule by UHPLC-MS/MS.
29729639|a|Although wide applications towards ischemic stroke in clinic, the therapeutic materials of Longxuetongluo Capsule (LTC) that is composed of total phenolic extract of Chinese dragon's blood, are still largely unclear. Exposure pattern characterization of those drug-derived components in vivo, notably in circulation system has been recommended as a viable approach to disclose the effective components of a given herbal medicine. Herein, we aimed to develop a robust method being capable of multi-component quantification in either rat plasma or tissues following oral administration of LTC, and to clarify the kinetic profiles of 11 primary drug-derived phenolic derivatives. Proteins precipitation was carried out for the plasma as well as homogenized tissue samples with acetonitrile. Chromatographic separations were achieved using UHPLC equipped with a shim-pack XR-ODS II column, and confidence-enhanced detection was accomplished through the joint employment of selected-reaction monitoring and tandem mass spectrometry (SRM-MS/MS) on a hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer. Diverse validation assays proved the method to be sensitive, precise, and rapid for simultaneous determination of those 11 components. Pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution investigations were subsequently conducted in rat after a single 500 mg/kg oral dose. Rapid absorption (Tmax, 11.53-68.27 min) and elimination (T1/2, 6.893-57.90 min) occurred for all analytes-of-interest. Extensive occurrences were observed for 7,4'-dihydroxy-5-methoxyhomoisoflavanone (Cmax, 340.0 ng/mL), thevetiaflavone (Cmax, 42.86 ng/mL), 5,7,4'-trihydroxyhomoisoflavanone (Cmax, 41.55 ng/mL), and pterostilbene (Cmax, 25.49 ng/mL) in plasma. Significant distributions occurred for all analytes in the liver as well as kidney, and several compounds could be found in brain. The findings described are envisioned to provide promising information for the in-depth clarification of the therapeutic entities, and also to offer a practical approach for therapeutic drug monitoring of LTC in clinic.

30097114|t|Botany, traditional use, phytochemistry, pharmacology, quality control, and authentication of Radix Gentianae Macrophyllae-A traditional medicine: A review.
30097114|a|BACKGROUND: Radix Gentianae Macrophyllae, commonly known as Qinjiao (in Chinese), is dried roots of medicinal plants that belong to Gentianaceae family and Gentiana genus. It has medically been used for the treatment of various diseases such as arthritis, stroke, facial paralysis, and scapulohumeral periarthritis in China since ancient times. PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and constructive overview of Qinjiao mainly containing Gentiana macrophylla Pall., Gentiana straminea Maxim., Gentiana crasicaulis Duthie ex Burk., and Gentiana daurica Fisch. in botany, traditional use, phytochemicals, pharmacology (biological activities and pharmacokinetics), quality control, and authentication according to the up-to-date data of available scientific literatures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All information regarding these four plants was collected from various academic search engines for example Google, Google Scholar, Web of Science, SciFinder, Pubmed, CNKI, and Wanfang. Additional information was obtained from botanical books, Chinese classic texts, and medical monographs. RESULTS: So far 166 compounds have been isolated and identified from Qinjiao plants together with Gentiana tibetica King ex Hook. f., Gentiana siphonantha Maxim., Gentiana officinalis H. Smith, and Gentiana waltonii Burk. Their constituents are mainly classified into iridoid glycosides, triterpenes, flavones, sterols, benzene derivatives, etc. The pharmacological studies demonstrate that Qinjiao plants display a wide range of bioactivities e.g. anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, hepato-protective, cardio- and neuro-protective, insecticidal, and anti-influenza effects. The conventional quality control is performed by determination of the concentration of some compounds, e.g., gentiopicroside, or establishment of the fingerprint. In addition to seed propagation, tissue culture technology has been used to address the limited supplies and guarantee the sustainable development of Qinjiao in the experimental scale. CONCLUSIONS: Although the identification of compounds from Qinjiao and demonstration of medicinal uses in vitro and in vivo have been carried out, various other studies on these plants should deserve our more attention. More efforts should be concentrated on the underlying mechanisms of their beneficial bioactivities. The proper toxic evaluation is indispensable to guarantee the safety, efficacy, and eligibility for medical use. To sum up, the summarized achievements could highlight the importance of Qinjiao and provide a solid foundation for scientists not only to further exploit the therapeutic potentials, but also possibly develop novel drugs in the subsequent research.

30018549|t|Danhong Injection Reversed Cardiac Abnormality in Brain-Heart Syndrome via Local and Remote β-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling.
30018549|a|Ischemic brain injury impacts cardiac dysfunction depending on the part of the brain affected, with a manifestation of irregular blood pressure, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Generally called brain-heart syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine, few mechanistic understanding and treatment options are available at present. We hypothesize that considering the established efficacy for both ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI), Danhong injection (DHI), a multicomponent Chinese patent medicine, may have a dual pharmacological potential for treating the brain-heart syndrome caused by cerebral ischemic stroke through its multi-targeted mechanisms. We investigated the role of DHI in the setting of brain-heart syndrome and determined the mechanism by which it regulates this process. We induced Ischemia/Reperfusion in Wistar rats and administered intravenous dose of DHI twice daily for 14 days. We assessed the neurological state, infarct volume, CT scan, arterial blood pressure, heart rhythm, and the hemodynamics. We harvested the brain and heart tissues for immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. Our data show that DHI exerts potent anti-stroke effects (infarct volume reduction: ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. vehicle. Neurological deficit correction: ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. vehicle), and effectively reversed the abnormal arterial pressure (∗p < 0.05 vs. vehicle) and heart rhythm (∗∗p < 0.01 vs. vehicle). The phenotype of this brain-heart syndrome is strikingly similar to those of MI model. Quantitative assessment of hemodynamic in cardiac functionality revealed a positive uniformity in the PV-loop after administration with DHI and valsartan in the latter. Immunohistochemistry and western blot results showed the inhibitory effect of DHI on the β-adrenergic pathway as well as protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) (∗∗p < 0.01 vs. model). Our data showed the underlying mechanisms of the brain-heart interaction and offer the first evidence that DHI targets the adrenergic pathway to modulate cardiac function in the setting of brain-heart syndrome. This study has made a novel discovery for proper application of the multi-target DHI and could serve as a therapeutic option in the setting of brain-heart syndrome.

29710516|t|Investigation of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) promotes neurovascular restoration and axonal remodeling after embolic stroke in rat using magnetic resonance imaging and histopathological analysis.
29710516|a|EGb 761 is a standardized natural extract from Ginkgo biloba leaf that has shown neuroprotective effects after ischemic stroke. This study aimed to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to noninvasively evaluate whether EGb 761 promotes neurovascular restoration and axonal remodeling in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and treated with EGb 761 (60 mg/kg) or saline intragastrically once daily for 15 days starting 6 h after MCAO. Functional recovery was analyzed using beam walking test. Multi-parametric MRI was applied to examine the alterations of gray-white structures, intracranial vessels, cerebral perfusion and axonal integrity, and followed with histological studies. Furthermore, the protein expression of axonal remodeling related signaling pathways including protein kinase B (AKT)/ glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)/ collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) and NogoA/NgR were detected by Western blotting analysis. Multi-parametric MRI demonstrated that EGb 761 significantly reduced infarct volume, alleviated gray and white matter damage, and enhanced collateral circulation, cerebral perfusion and axonal remodeling. Histological examinations supported the MRI results. EGb 761 treatment facilitated behavioral recovery and amplified endogenous neurogenesis. Notably, treatment with EGb 761 significantly increased the levels of p-AKT, p-GSK-3β and decreased the expression of p-CRMP2. In addition, EGb 761 treatment up-regulated the expression of growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and suppressed the activation of axonal growth inhibitory molecules NogoA and NgR. These findings indicated that EGb 761 enhanced neurovascular restoration, amplified endogenous neurogenesis and promoted axonal regeneration, which in concert may contribute to gray-white matter reorganization and functional outcome after stroke.

29687375|t|Acetylshikonin attenuates angiotensin II-induced proliferation and motility of human brain smooth muscle cells by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
29687375|a|Cerebrovascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration contribute to hyperplasia in case of cerebrovascular remodeling and stroke. In the present study, we investigated the effects of acetylshikonin, the main ingredient of a Chinese traditional medicine Zicao, on human brain vascular smooth muscle cell (HBVSMCs) proliferation and migration induced by angiotensin II (AngII), and the underlying mechanisms. We found that acetylshikonin treatment significantly inhibited AngII-induced HBVSMCs proliferation and cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase. Wound-healing assay and Transwell assay showed that AngII-induced cell migration and invasion were markedly attenuated by acetylshikonin. In addition, AngII challenge significantly induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation, as evidenced by increased β-catenin phosphorylation and nuclear translocation and GSK-3β phosphorylation. However, acetylshikonin treatment inhibited the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Consequently, western blotting analysis revealed that acetylshikonin effectively reduced the expression of downstream target genes in AngII-treated cells, including c-myc, survivin and cyclin D1, which contributed to the inhibitory effect of acetylshikonin on HBVSMCs proliferation. Further, stimulation with recombinant Wnt3a dramatically reversed acetylshikonin-mediated inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle transition in HBVSMCs. Our study demonstrates that acetylshikonin prevents AngII-induced cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells proliferation and migration through inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, indicating that acetylshikonin may present a potential option for the treatment of cerebrovascular remodeling.

29603379|t|Impact of prediabetes on poststroke depression in Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke.
29603379|a|OBJECTIVE: It is unknown whether prediabetes is a predictor of poststroke depression (PSD). We aimed to explore the relationship between prediabetes and PSD in Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study, and a total of 358 patients with acute ischemic stroke were recruited and enrolled. Patients were divided into 3 groups: normal glucose group (NGT, n = 96), prediabetes group (preDM, n = 134, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and/or HbA1c (A1c) 5.7%-6.4%), and the diabetes mellitus group (DM, n = 128). At 1 month after stroke, patients with a Hamilton Depression Scale score of ≥8 were diagnosed as PSD. RESULTS: In post hoc comparisons, the risk of PSD in patients with diabetes and prediabetes was higher than patients with NGT (37.5% vs 31.3% vs 14.6%, P = .001). Compared with NGT, the incidence rate of PSD in patients with prediabetes with HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% and patients with prediabetes with IFG/IGT + HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% was higher (35.3% vs 14.6%, 38.0% vs 14.6%; P = .006; P = .003, respectively). In logistic regression, prediabetes with HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% and prediabetes with IFG/IGT + HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% were a significant independent predictor of PSD after adjusting for potential confounding factors, with odd ratios of 1.731 and 1.978, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that prediabetes was associated with PSD and may predict its development at 1 month poststroke. In prediabetes subgroups, patients with HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% were more likely to develop PSD compared to NGT and IFG/IGT groups.

29974381|t|Levo-tetrahydropalmatine Attenuates Neuron Apoptosis Induced by Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury: Involvement of c-Abl Activation.
29974381|a|Ischemic stroke is one of the most dangerous acute diseases which causes death or deformity. Apoptosis has been shown to play an important role in the development and pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R injury), but the related mechanism is unclear. Levo-tetrahydropalmatine (L-THP), a bioactive ingredient extracted from the Chinese herb Corydalis, can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and exert various pharmacological effects on neural tissues. The present study examined the neuroprotective effect of L-THP on neuronal apoptosis induced by cerebral I/R injury. Results showed that pretreatment with L-THP (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg) improved neurological outcomes and reduced infarct volume and cerebral edema in comparison with the brains of the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group. These findings provided evidence for the neuroprotective effects of L-THP against cerebral I/R injury. Furthermore, administration of L-THP enhanced the expression of Bcl-2 and attenuated the content of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP. L-THP could improve the reduction of NeuN-positive cells induced by I/R injury. These results suggested that L-THP could inhibit neuroapoptosis in cerebral ischemic rats. c-Abl was discovered as the critical protein responsible for neurocyte apoptosis; however, few data have been published on the relation between ischemic stroke and the expression of c-Abl. We found that both c-Abl expression and neuronal apoptosis were significantly increased in the MCAO group, while pretreatment with L-THP could ameliorate this effect. Therefore, we deduced that reduced c-Abl overexpression may play a role in the anti-apoptosis effect of L-THP after cerebral I/R injury. Thus, L-THP may provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.

29571757|t|Memory Impairment Due to a Small Acute Infarction of the Columns of the Fornix.
29571757|a|BACKGROUND: Clinically infarction of the columns of the fornix is very rare. It is also easy to be overlooked during imaging examination due to the special anatomical localization and features of columns of the fornix. In the meantime, with memory disorder to be its most prominent manifestation, it is very easily false diagnosed as other diseases when the lesion focus is overlooked, causing unnecessary invasive examinations like cerebrospinal fluid tests. METHODS: Case report and Literature review. RESULTS: We presented a 66-year-old woman with memory impairment due to a small acute infarction of the columns of the fornix. Through her diagnosis and treatment, we believed that early diagnosis and treatment were important to these patients who were enduring the disease. In addition, literature review informed us that for those unwilling to undergo cerebral angiography or for small cerebrovascular lesions that cannot be detected by angiography, 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be an ideal diagnostic method. CONCLUSION: This case illustrated the significance of MRI in diagnosis for patients with acute memory impairment. When reading MRI results, one needs to pay attention to identify small lesions at special locations. In addition, cerebral apoplexy is still the first consideration of diagnosis when acute memory impairment occurs in patients with cerebrovascular disease risk factors.

30045326|t|A retrospective study of traditional Chinese medicine as an adjunctive therapy for patients with chronic heart failure.
30045326|a|This study retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine Shenqilixin Formula (SQLXF) as an adjunctive intervention for treating patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).This retrospective study included 135 patients with CHF. They were allocated to a treatment group or a control group according to the different treatments they received. Seventy five patients in the treatment group underwent SQLXF plus routine treatment, while 60 subjects in the control group received routine treatment only. The primary outcome was cardiac function. It was measured by the left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVDD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output (CO), every cardiac output (ECO), and cardiac index (CI). The secondary outcome included motor function. It was measured by the standard 6-MinuteWalk Test (6MWT). In addition, adverse events (AEs) were also recorded.Compared to subjects in the control group, patients in the treatment group revealed greater effectiveness in cardiac function, measured by LVEF (P < .05), CO (P < .05), and ECO (P < .05), and motor function, measured by the 6MWT scale (P < .05). Moreover, no significant differences of AEs were found between the 2 groups.SQLXF as an adjunctive therapy to routine treatment may help to improve both cardiac and motor function in patients with CHF.

30028327|t|Houshiheisan and its components promote axon regeneration after ischemic brain injury.
30028327|a|Houshiheisan, a classic prescription in traditional Chinese medicine, contains Flos Chrysanthemi, Radix Saposhnikoviae, Ramulus Cinnamomi, Rhizoma Chuanxiong, Radix et Rhizoma Asari, Radix Platycodonis, Rhizoma Atractylodis macrocephalae, Poria, Rhizoma Zingiberis, Radix Angelicae sinensis, Radix et Rhizoma Ginseng, Radix Scutellariae and Concha Ostreae. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, Flos Chrysanthemi, Radix Saposhnikoviae, Ramulus Cinnamomi, Rhizoma Chuanxiong, Radix et Rhizoma Asari and Radix Platycodonis are wind-dispelling drugs; Rhizoma Atractylodis macrocephalae, Poria, Rhizoma Zingiberis, Radix Angelicae sinensis and Radix et Rhizoma Ginseng are deficiency-nourishing drugs. A large number of randomized controlled trials have shown that Houshiheisan is effective in treating stroke, but its mechanism of action is unknown. Axonal remodeling is an important mechanism in neural protection and regeneration. Therefore, this study explored the effect and mechanism of action of Houshiheisan on the repair of axons after cerebral ischemia. Rat models of focal cerebral ischemia were established by ligating the right middle cerebral artery. At 6 hours after model establishment, rats were intragastrically administered 10.5 g/kg Houshiheisan or 7.7 g/kg wind-dispelling drug or 2.59 g/kg deficiency-nourishing drug. These medicines were intragastrically administered as above every 24 hours for 7 consecutive days. Houshiheisan, and its wind-dispelling and deficiency-nourishing components reduced the neurological deficit score and ameliorated axon and neuron lesions after cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, Houshiheisan, and its wind-dispelling and deficiency-nourishing components decreased the expression of proteins that inhibit axonal remodeling: amyloid precursor protein, neurite outgrowth inhibitor protein A (Nogo-A), Rho family small GTPase A (RhoA) and Rho-associated kinase 2 (Rock2), and increased the expression of growth associated protein-43, microtubule-associated protein-2, netrin-1, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42). The effect of Houshiheisan was stronger than wind-dispelling drugs or deficiency-nourishing drugs alone. In conclusion, Houshiheisan, and wind-dispelling and deficiency-nourishing drugs promote the repair of axons and nerve regeneration after cerebral ischemia through Nogo-A/RhoA/Rock2 and Netrin-1/Rac1/Cdc42 signaling pathways. These effects are strongest with Houshiheisan.

29730311|t|Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate promotes endothelial integrity via regulating VE-cadherin dynamics and RhoA/ROCK-mediated cellular contractility and prevents atorvastatin-induced intracerebral hemorrhage in zebrafish.
29730311|a|Impaired vascular integrity leads to serious cerebral vascular diseases such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In addition, high-dose statin therapy is suggested to cause increased ICH risk due to unclear effects of general inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) on the vascular system. Here we evaluated the protective effects of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS), which has high efficacy and safety in clinical studies of ischemic stroke, by using atorvastatin (Ator) induced ICH zebrafish embryos and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). By using double transgenic Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 & Tg(gata1a:dsRed)sd2 zebrafish, we demonstrated that STS effectively reduced the occurrence and area of hemorrhage induced by Ator in zebrafish and restored impairment in motor function. We further demonstrated that Ator-induced disruption in VE-cadherin (VEC)-containing cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs) in HUVECs by enhancing Src-induced VEC internalization and RhoA/ROCK-mediated cellular contraction. STS inhibited Ator-induced Src activation and subsequent VEC internalization and actin depolymerization near cell borders, reducing lesions between neighboring cells and increasing barrier functions. STS also inhibited the Ator-induced RhoA/ROCK-mediated cellular contraction by regulating downstream LIMK/cofilin and MYPT1/MLC phosphatase signaling. These results showed that STS significantly promoted the stability of cell junctions and vascular integrity. Moreover, we observed that regulations of both Src and RhoA/ROCK are required for the maintenance of vascular integrity, and Src inhibitor (PP2) or ROCK inhibitors (fasudil and H1152) alone could not reduce the occurrence Ator-induced ICH. Taken together, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of Ator-induced endothelial instability, and provided scientific evidences of STS as potential ICH therapeutics by promoting vascular integrity.

29950602|t|Reducing histone acetylation rescues cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome.
29950602|a|Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent inherited intellectual disability, resulting from a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Patients with FXS suffer lifelong cognitive disabilities, but the function of FMRP in the adult brain and the mechanism underlying age-related cognitive decline in FXS is not fully understood. Here, we report that a loss of FMRP results in increased protein synthesis of histone acetyltransferase EP300 and ubiquitination-mediated degradation of histone deacetylase HDAC1 in adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs). Consequently, FMRP-deficient NSCs exhibit elevated histone acetylation and age-related NSC depletion, leading to cognitive impairment in mature adult mice. Reducing histone acetylation rescues both neurogenesis and cognitive deficits in mature adult FMRP-deficient mice. Our work reveals a role for FMRP and histone acetylation in cognition and presents a potential novel therapeutic strategy for treating adult FXS patients.

29943755|t|Electroacupuncture Inhibits Apoptosis of Peri-Ischemic Regions via Modulating p38, Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK1/2), and c-Jun N Terminal Kinases (JNK) in Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion-Injured Rats.
29943755|a|BACKGROUND Previous studies suggested that inhibition of apoptosis prevents the dysfunction of ischemia-reperfusion injury. In the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion injury, JNK/ERK1/2 and p38 play an essential role in regulation of cell apoptosis. Electroacupuncture (EA), a form of acupuncture, has demonstrated superiority in preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. In the present study, we explored the effects of electroacupuncture at Shenting (GV24) and Baihui (GV20) acupoints on focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (MCAO) rats, and explored whether JNK/ERK1/2- and p38-mediated cell apoptosis are involved. MATERIAL AND METHODS The rats were divided into a sham operation control group, an ischemia group, and an electroacupuncture group with acupuncture applied for 10 days (30 min per day). TTC staining was used to calculate the ischemic brain volume. TUNEL staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis and Bio-Plex were used to detect JNK, p38, ERK1/2, Bcl-2, and Bax protein expression. RESULTS We found that electroacupuncture at day 10 significantly reduced cerebral infarction. In addition, electroacupuncture suppressed activation of JNK and p38, while enhancing the activation of ERK1/2 in the peri-ischemic regions. Consequently, the effect of electroacupuncture on these pathways resulted in the inhibition of apoptosis, which was demonstrated by TUNEL and transmission electron microscopy. We found that electroacupuncture upregulated the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bax ratio in peri-ischemic regions. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that inhibition of cell apoptosis via regulating multiple signaling pathways might be a mechanism whereby electroacupuncture has a positive therapeutic effect on post-stroke impairment.

30046341|t|Xijiao Dihuang Decoction Alleviates Ischemic Brain Injury in MCAO Rats by Regulating Inflammation, Neurogenesis, and Angiogenesis.
30046341|a|Ischemic stroke is an increasingly important public health problem, and no effective treatments are approved. Xijiao Dihuang Decoction (XDD), a famous herbal formula for treating hemorrhagic fever syndromes, has been shown to exert powerful neuroprotective property. The aim of this study was to identify the chemical constituents in XDD, observe the neuroprotective effect of XDD against acute ischemic stroke, and explore the specific mechanisms by which these effects were mediated. With UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS, 47 components in XDD were detected and 25 of them were identified. In rats subjected to MCAO, XDD ameliorated neurological deficit, histopathology changes, and infarction volume. In addition, levels of TNF-ɑ, IL-6, and IL-1β in XDD-treated group were significantly lower compared to the model group. Mechanistic studies showed that XDD inhibited MCAO-induced NF-κB activation, presenting as downregulating the expression of phospho-NF-κB p65 and preventing IκBɑ degradation. Besides, BDNF, GDNF, VEGF, bFGF, and CD34 levels were significantly increased by XDD, suggesting that the protective effects of XDD may also be associated with the promotion of neurogenesis and angiogenesis. In conclusion, these findings provided a novel regulatory pathway of the neuroprotective effect of XDD that helped rehabilitate patients with stroke.

30091545|t|[Treatment of Stroke Patients with Shoulder-wrist Syndrome by Acupoint Catgut Embedding and Surface Electromyogram Biofeedback Therapy].
30091545|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effectiveness of acupoint catgut embedding and surface electromyogram biofeedback therapy (sEMGBF) in the treatment of stroke patients complicated with shoulder-hand syndrome (SHS). METHODS: A total of 90 stroke patients with SHS were randomly divided into acupoint catgut embedment (ACE), sEMGBF and ACE+sEMGBF (combined treatment) groups (n=30 cases/group). The catgut embedment was performed at Jianliao (LI 14), Jianyu (LI 15), Quchi (LI 11), Waiguan (TE 5) on the affected side, once every 3 weeks, twice altogether. The electromyographic biofeedback therapy (30-50 Hz, pulse duration 200 µs, 6 s-on and 10 s-off, appropriate strength) was applied to the skin area co-vering the deltoid muscle, flexor muscle of wrist and wrist extensor for 20 min, once per day, 5 times/week, for 6 weeks. The total effective rate was assessed by using Liao's and Zhu's methods (1996), the pain severity assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS), and Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA, 66-points) scale and the patients' activities of daily living function (ADL, 100-points) were also scored. RESULTS: Before treatment, the VAS, FMA and ADL points of the three groups were not significantly different (P>0.05). After the treatment, the total effective rate (93.33%), FMA and ADL scores of the combined treatment group were significantly higher than those of the ACE and sEMGBF groups (P<0.05), while the VAS score of the combined treatment group was significantly lower than those of the ACE and sEMGBF groups (P<0.05). The total effective rates, FMA and ADL scores of the ACE and sEMGBF groups were comparable (P>0.05). The VAS score of the ACE group was markedly lower than that of the sEMGBF group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The combined administration of ACE and sEMGBF has a better therapeutic effect for stroke patients complicated with SHS relevant to simple ACE and simple sEMGBF therapy in improving the upper limb function, relieving pain, and enhancing the daily life quality.

29934385|t|Effect of Baduanjin exercise on cognitive function in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
29934385|a|INTRODUCTION: Poststroke cognitive impairment is one of the most common complications in stroke survivors, and >65% of these patients suffer from cognitive impairment at 12 months following onset, which strongly affects the rehabilitation of their motor function and quality of life. Therefore, it is important to improve the cognitive ability of stroke survivors. As an important component of traditional Chinese Qigong exercises, characterised by the coordination of mind and body with a low exercise intensity, Baduanjin has the potential benefit of improving cognitive ability for patients who had a stroke with cognitive impairment. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of Baduanjin training on the cognitive function of stroke survivors.

30013463|t|Association Between Programed Cell Death-1 and CD4+ T Cell Alterations in Different Phases of Ischemic Stroke Patients.
30013463|a|Objective: We aimed to analyze alterations in T cell subgroups during different post-ischemic stroke (IS) phases to explore the possible mechanisms underlying stroke-induced immune depression (SIID). Methods: Sixty-four IS patients who met the entry criteria were divided into three groups: an acute phase group, a sub-acute phase group and a stable phase group. Fourteen healthy individuals were selected as normal controls. The phenotype distribution of T cells in patient peripheral blood was analyzed, and the immune checkpoint receptors programed cell death-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) were detected in different T cell phenotypes. Results: Compared with the control group, the absolute number of CD4+ T cells and CD4+ T central memory (TCM) cells was significantly increased in the acute phase group but decreased in the sub-acute phase and stable phase groups compared with that in the acute phase group. PD-1 expression in CD4+ T cells in the stable phase group showed a significant increase compared with that in the acute phase group. The expression of PD-1 on CD4+ TCM cells and CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cells showed significant decreases in the acute phase compared with control cells; however, in the sub-acute phase and the stable phase, PD-1 expression was significantly increased compared with that in the acute phase. Conclusions: T cell dysfunction, especially CD4+ T cell dysfunction, occurred during different IS phases. PD-1 was highly expressed in CD4+ T cells of different phenotypes after the acute phase and was associated with alterations in CD4+ T cells. Particularly, PD-1 was negatively correlated with the absolute number of TCM cells among different CD4+ T cell phenotypes, which may be one of the possible mechanisms of SIID.

29988372|t|Risk Factors of Subclinical Atherosclerosis and Plaque Burden in High Risk Individuals: Results From a Community-Based Study.
29988372|a|China is going through major change and the incidence of first-ever stroke has increased dramatically. In this study, we aim to determine the ultrasound characteristics of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid plaques (CP) in the Chinese community-based population with high risk of stroke. 1009 stroke-free participants from Datun community were classified at high risk of stroke and included in this cross-sectional study. We performed B-mode carotid ultrasound imaging in all of the study subjects to measure the CIMT in the common carotid artery (CCA) far wall and CP in the CCA, bifurcation and internal carotid artery. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with elevated CIMT and subclinical atherosclerosis, as well as plaque burden (≥2 plaques). Our results showed that traditional risk factors including aging, hypertension, current smoking and the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and plaque burden in high-risk community residents. To improve primary prevention in this population, we may consider intense blood pressure and lipid management, and smoking cessation.

29921675|t|Comparison of the efficacy and acceptability of Chinese herbal medicine in adult patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: study protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
29921675|a|INTRODUCTION: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is defined as the clinical diagnosis of heart failure (HF) and ejection fraction (EF) ≤40%, which is a severe public healthcare issue and brings a heavy social and economic burden for patients with HFrEF. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has a long history in treating HF. Questions concerning the efficacy and acceptability of CHM-related interventions in adult patients with HFrEF led us to use the method of systematic review and network meta-analysis to integrate direct and indirect evidence to create hierarchies for all CHM. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Nine medical databases, including PubMed, EMBASE (OVID), the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Database and CBM will be searched from the date of database inception to June 2015 (updated to March 2017) without language and publication status restriction. Completely randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CHM or CHM plus routine treatment with CHM, CHM plus routine treatment, routine treatment, no treatment or placebo for adults with HFrEF will be examined. Our primary outcomes will include all-cause mortality, HF-related death, all-cause rehospitalisation, HF-related rehospitalisation and acceptability (discontinuation due to any adverse events during treatment). Secondary outcomes will include response rate, mean value or mean difference from baseline of surrogate indexes. We will perform the Bayesian network meta-analyses (NMA) for the most frequently reported primary or secondary outcome and the acceptability outcome, if available. Meta-regression, subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses will be conducted based on prespecified effect modifiers to assess the robustness of the findings. DISSEMINATION: The results of this NMA will provide useful information about the effectiveness and acceptability of CHM in adults with HFrEF, which will also have implications for clinical practice and further research. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publication and conference presentations. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42016053854.

29715458|t|LncRNA FIRRE/NF-kB feedback loop contributes to OGD/R injury of cerebral microglial cells.
29715458|a|Stroke is one of the leading causes for serious long-term neurological disability. LncRNAs have been investigated to be dysregulated in ischemic stroke. However, the underlying mechanisms of some specific lncRNAs have not been clearly clarified. To determine lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism in ischemic stroke, we constructed OGD/R injury model of cerebral microglial cells. Microarray analysis was carried out and analyzed that lncRNA functional intergenic repeating RNA element (FIRRE) was associated with OGD/R injury. Based on the molecular biotechnology, we demonstrated that FIRRE could activate NF-kB signal pathway. Meanwhile, the activated NF-kB promoted FIRRE expression in OGD/R-treated cerebral microglial cells. Therefore, FIRRE and NF-kB formed a positive feedback loop to promote the transcription of NLRP3 inflammasome, thus contributed to the OGD/R injury of cerebral microglial cells. All findings in this study may help to explore novel and specific therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.

29909773|t|Chronic hepatitis B virus infection and risk of chronic kidney disease: a population-based prospective cohort study of 0.5 million Chinese adults.
29909773|a|BACKGROUND: Existing evidence remains inconclusive as to the association between chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We prospectively examined the association between chronic HBV infection and CKD risk, and the joint associations of HBV infection with established risk factors of several lifestyle factors and prevalent diseases on CKD risk. METHODS: Participants from the China Kadoorie Biobank were enrolled during 2004-2008 and followed up until 31 December 2015. After excluding participants with previously diagnosed CKD, cancer, heart disease, and stroke at baseline, the present study included 469,459 participants. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was qualitatively tested at baseline. Incident CKD cases were identified mainly through the health insurance system and disease and death registries. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.1 years (4.2 million person-years), we documented 4555 incident cases of CKD. Cox regression yielded multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Compared with HBsAg-negative participants, the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) for CKD was 1.37 (1.18, 1.60) for HBsAg-positive participants. The association was stronger in men (HR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.43, 2.20) than in women (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.36). HBsAg-positive participants, with or without hepatitis or cirrhosis, whether or not under treatment, all showed increased risk of developing CKD. We observed positive additive interactions of HBsAg positivity with smoking, physical inactivity, or diabetes on CKD risk. Compared with HBsAg-negative participants who were nonsmokers, more physically active, or did not have diabetes at baseline, the greatest CKD risk for HBsAg-positive participants was for those who were smokers (HR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.44, 2.38), physically inactive (HR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.52, 2.40), or diabetic (HR = 6.11; 95% CI: 4.47, 8.36). CONCLUSIONS: In countries with a high endemicity of HBV infection, kidney damage associated with chronic HBV infection should be a non-negligible concern. Our findings also highlight the importance of health advice on quitting smoking, increasing physical activity, improving glucose control, and early screening for CKD in people with chronic HBV infection.

29962950|t|UPLC-QTOF/MSE and Bioassay Are Available Approaches for Identifying Quality Fluctuation of Xueshuantong Lyophilized Powder in Clinic.
29962950|a|Xueshuantong Lyophilized Powder (XST), consisting of a series of saponins extracted from Panax notoginseng, is widely applied to treat acute cerebral infarction, stroke, and coronary heart disease in China. However, most adverse drug reactions (ADR) in clinic are caused by quality problems of XST. In this study, six batches of certainly abnormal, four batches of possibly abnormal XST, and eight batches of normal XST were obtained from the clinical practice. Their quality fluctuations were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry operating in MSE mode (UPLC-QTOF/MSE) and bioassays including antithrombin and proplasmin assay. Fourteen potential components responsible for clinical ADR were identified by UPLC-QTOF/MSE, especially ginsenoside Rg1, Rg3, Rb1 and notoginsenoside R1. In addition, 83.3% (5/6) and 50.0% (3/6) certainly abnormal samples could be identified by UPLC-QTOF/MSE and bioassay, respectively. Interestingly, further integration of the two methods could entirely identify all the certainly abnormal samples and inferred that all the possibly abnormal samples were closely related to their quality fluctuation. It indicates that it is advisable to combine UPLC-QTOF/MSE and bioassay for identifying quality fluctuation of XST, and thus reduce its ADR in clinic.

29914063|t|Traditional Chinese Medical Care and Incidence of Stroke in Elderly Patients Treated with Antidiabetic Medications.
29914063|a|OBJECTIVES: Experimental research has shown that herbal and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) may serve as complements to Western medicine treatments in the control of blood glucose and cardiovascular complications, but population-based studies are limited. We investigated the association between TCM use and subsequent risk of stroke in older patients with diabetes. STUDY DESIGN: The database used in this cohort study contained longitudinal medical claims for one million subjects randomly selected among beneficiaries of a universal health care program in Taiwan. We identified a cohort of patients with diabetes aged 65 years and older who initiated anti-diabetic medications from 2000 to 2012. Patients who had at least two TCM outpatient visits after their initiation of anti-diabetic medications were considered TCM users. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of stroke was measured until 2013. Cox regression models with TCM use as a time-dependent variable were used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing TCM use with no use. RESULTS: Over the 13-year period, 17,015 patients were identified; 4912 (28.9%) of them were TCM users. The incidence of stroke during the follow-up (per 1000 person-years) was 22.8 in TCM users and 25.7 in non-users. TCM users had an adjusted HR of 0.93 for the incidence of ischemic stroke (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83, 1.04) and of 0.89 for developing hemorrhagic stroke (95% CI 0.66, 1.19), compared with non-users. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, in older patients receiving Western medicine treatments for diabetes, TCM use was not associated with an increased risk of developing ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.

29550579|t|Pien-Tze-Huang protects cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis in acute ischemic stroke rats.
29550579|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pien-Tze-Huang (PZH) is a famous formula of traditional Chinese medicine used to treating stroke. However, the protective effect of PZH and its mechanisms in acute ischemic stroke remain to be explored. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the protective effect of PZH on neuronal apoptosis in acute cerebral ischemic injury rats and explore its underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of PZH were studied in acute ischemic stroke rats induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic proteins including cytochrome C (Cyt C), Bax, Bcl-xl, P53, caspase-3, and caspase-9 as well as AKT and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) were assessed. RESULTS: Four days of PZH treatment (180 mg/kg) could significantly reduce cerebral infarct volume, improve neurological deficit, attenuate inflammatory response, and inhibit neuronal apoptosis in acute ischemic stroke rats. Moreover, PZH treatment significantly decreased cytosolic Cyt C, Bax, P53, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9 levels, but elevated mitochondrial Cyt C and Bcl-xl levels. PZH treatment also increased phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3β. CONCLUSION: PZH potently protects the brain from cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo, and inhibiting mitochondria-mediated neuronal apoptosis as well as attenuating inflammatory responses may be involved in this effect. This study provides experimental basis of PZH in treating acute cerebral ischemic stroke, which would provide some novel insights for its prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke.

29972007|t|[WANG Leting's academic thoughts on the treatment of stroke].
29972007|a|WANG Leting, known as gold-needle master has its own unique academic system in the treatment of stroke. In view of principle, rule, recipe, acupoint and technique, WANG Leting's academic thoughts were reviewed in the treatment of stroke. In terms of theoretic foundation, treating principles, formula application, rules of acupoint selection and manipulation techniques, the characteristics on the academic thoughts on the treatment of stroke were explained. Professor WANG believes that stroke is caused by deficiency, fire, wind, phlegm, qi and blood. Promoting meridian and collateral circulation, regaining consciousness and cultivating zangfu functions are the treating principles. The acupoint application is characterized as the acupoint selection by stages and the combination of local points with the points in the front and on the back. The penetrating-needling technique and moxibustion are predominated in the treatment.

29625260|t|Protective effects of Polygonum multiflorum on ischemic stroke rat model analysed by 1H NMR metabolic profiling.
29625260|a|Stroke is the third most common cause of death in most industrialized countries. Polygonum multiflorum (He-Shou-Wu, HSW) is one of the traditional Chinese medicines with multiple pharmacological activities which is widely used in Chinese recipe. This study aims to explore the protective effect of HSW on ischemic stroke rat model and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The mortality rate, neurological deficit, cerebral infarct size, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, biochemical parameters, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to access the treatment effects of HSW on ischemic stroke. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) based metabolomics analysis disclosed that HSW could relieve stroke rats suffering from the ischemia/reperfusion injury by ameliorating the disturbed energy and amino acids metabolisms, alleviating the oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species and reducing the inflammation. HSW treatment increased levels of cellular antioxidants that scavenged reactive oxygen species during ischemia-reperfusion via the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 signaling pathway, and exert anti-inflammatory effect by decreasing the levels of inflammatory factors such as cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. The integrated metabolomics approach showed its potential in understanding mechanisms of HSW in relieving ischemic stroke. Further study to develop HSW as an effective therapeutic agent to treat ischemic stroke is warranted.

29872082|t|Serum N1-methylnicotinamide is Associated with Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction in Chinese.
29872082|a|We previously reported that serum N1-methylnicotinamide (me-NAM), an indicator of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) activity, was associated with obesity, diabetes, and coronary artery disease in Chinese patients. However, whether NNMT might play a role in the development of heart failure remains to be elucidated. In this study, the associations between levels of serum me-NAM and left ventricular structure and function were investigated in Chinese patients. Serum me-NAM was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 265 subjects. M-mode, 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography were performed with the GE Vivid E9 system to assess left ventricular structure and function. Of note, the participants in the top tertile of me-NAM had the lowest left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW), and highest prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Serum me-NAM was negatively correlated with LVEF and PRSW before and after adjusted for potential confounding variables (P ≤ 0.02). In multiple logistic regression analyses, the subjects in the top tertile of me-NAM had highest risks for LVSD (OR 6.80; 95% CI 1.26-36.72; P = 0.026), which was also observed in continuous analyses (OR 9.48; 95% CI 1.41-63.48; P = 0.02). In conclusion, serum me-NAM is negatively associated with LVEF and PRSW and accordingly positively associated with the prevalence of LVSD in Chinese patients.

29345255|t|Pure mechanistic analysis of additive neuroprotective effects between baicalin and jasminoidin in ischemic stroke mice.
29345255|a|Both baicalin (BA) and jasminoidin (JA) are active ingredients in Chinese herb medicine Scutellaria baicalensis and Fructus gardeniae, respectively. They have been shown to exert additive neuroprotective action in ischemic stroke models. In this study we used transcriptome analysis to explore the pure therapeutic mechanisms of BA, JA and their combination (BJ) contributing to phenotype variation and reversal of pathological processes. Mice with middle cerebral artery obstruction were treated with BA, JA, their combination (BJ), or concha margaritifera (CM). Cerebral infarct volume was examined to determine the effect of these compounds on phenotype. Using the hippocampus microarray and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software, we exacted the differentially expressed genes, networks, pathways, and functions in positive-phenotype groups (BA, JA and BJ) by comparing with the negative-phenotype group (CM). In the BA, JA, and BJ groups, a total of 7, 4, and 11 specific target molecules, 1, 1, and 4 networks, 51, 59, and 18 canonical pathways and 70, 53, and 64 biological functions, respectively, were identified. Pure therapeutic mechanisms of BA and JA were mainly overlapped in specific target molecules, functions and pathways, which were related to the nervous system, inﬂammation and immune response. The specific mechanisms of BA and JA were associated with apoptosis and cancer-related signaling and endocrine and hormone regulation, respectively. In the BJ group, novel target profiles distinct from mono-therapies were revealed, including 11 specific target molecules, 10 functions, and 10 pathways, the majority of which were related to a virus-mediated immune response. The pure additive effects between BA and JA were based on enhanced action in virus-mediated immune response. This pure mechanistic analysis may provide a clearer outline of the target profiles of multi-target compounds and combination therapies.

29022576|t|Xueshuantong injection (lyophilized) combined with salvianolate lyophilized injection protects against focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats through attenuation of oxidative stress.
29022576|a|Salvianolate lyophilized injection (SLI) and Xueshuantong injection (lyophilized) (XST) are two herbal standardized preparations that have been widely used in China for the treatment of acute cerebral infarction. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of SLI combined with XST in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO/R). Wistar rats were subjected to 1.5 h of MCAO followed by reperfusion for 3 h, then were treated with SLI or XST alone, or with their combinations via tail vein injection daily for 3 d. Edaravone (EDI, 6 mg·kg-1·d-1) was used as a positive control drug, We showed that administration of a combination of 1X1S (XST 100 mg·kg-1·d-1 plus SLI 21 mg·kg-1·d-1) more effectively protected the ischemic brains than SLI or XST used alone. Administration of 1X1S not only significantly decreased neurological deficit scores and infarct volumes and increased regional cerebral blood flow, but also inhibited the activation of both microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus. Furthermore, administration of 1X1S significantly decreased the levels of MDA and ROS with concomitant increases in the levels of antioxidant activity (SOD, CAT and GSH) in the brain tissues as compared with SLI and XST used alone. Moreover, administration of 1X1S remarkably upregulated the expression of Nrf-2, HO-1 and NQO-1, and downregulated the expression of Keap1 and facilitated the nuclear translocation of Nrf-2 in the brain tissues as compared with XST used alone.

29728011|t|The protective roles of L-borneolum, D-borneolum and synthetic borneol in cerebral ischaemia via modulation of the neurovascular unit.
29728011|a|OBJECTIVE: Borneol has been used to treat stroke in China since ancient times. In our previous research, we demonstrated the effect of borneol on cerebral ischaemia injury via meta-analysis. The neurovascular unit (NVU) is the structural basis of the preservation of the brain microenvironment and is believed to be a promising target in treating stroke. In this research, we explored the roles of three kinds of borneol, namely, L-borneolum (B1), D-borneolum (B2) and synthetic borneol (B3), in the NVU with permanent middle cerebral artery occluded (pMCAO) rats. METHODS: The Longa scoring method was used to evaluate nerve function deficits in the pMCAO rats. Awakening time, brain water content, brain index and brain edema rate were also measured. TTC staining was used to calculate the cerebral infarction rate. The morphology of the ischaemia penumbra brain tissue was observed via HE staining, and the neuronal denatured cell index (DCI) was calculated. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and TNF-α in the serum. Moreover, the ultrastructures of the neurons and of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) were observed using transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of Claudin-5, Bcl-2 and Bax in the ischaemia penumbra of pMCAO rats were detected using real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Pretreatment with B1, B2 and B3 delayed the recovery time (P < 0.01). B1 remarkably ameliorated neurological deficits 24 h after cerebral ischaemia (P < 0.05). Moreover, B1 and B3 were both able to ameliorate brain edema and the area of cerebral infarction. In addition, B1, B2 and B3 all increased serum VEGF levels and decreased serum TNF-α levels (P < 0.01). For the ultrastructure determination, the BBB and the nerve centre were significantly improved by B1, B2 and B3. The mechanistic exploration revealed that B2 and B3 protected the brain by reducing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). Immunohistochemistry suggested that B1, B2 and B3 could also enhance the expression of Claudin-5 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The three kinds of borneol demonstrated different protective effects on cerebral ischaemia injury. L-Borneolum displayed the most prominent anti-cerebral ischaemia effect among them. The mechanism was most likely executed via anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammation effects and maintenance of the stability of the BBB and TJs to comprehensively improve NVU function.

29713851|t|Assessment of Complementary Treatment with Yiqi Fumai Lyophilized Injection on Acute Decompensated Ischemic Heart Failure (ACT-ADIHF): Rationale and Design of a Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial.
29713851|a|BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is the end stage of many heart diseases, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the primary cause. Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection, a contemporary Chinese medicine preparation, widely used in the treatment of IHF patients, shows clinical efficacy on improving symptoms and cardiac function, but the quality of the current literature does not address multiple important issues. This article describes a protocol for assessment of complementary treatment with Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection in acute decompensated IHD. METHODS: The protocol is designed as a multicenter randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of complementary treatment with Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection on acute decompensated IHD. This trial will be carried out in 37 hospitals in China and expected to enroll 666 inpatients with acute decompensated IHF due to coronary heart disease. On the basis of standardized western medications, patients are randomized to either the treatment group (250 ml 5% glucose / sodium injection + 5.2 g Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection) or the control group for 7 days and follow-up for 30 ± 3 and 60 ± 3 days. The primary outcome is change in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations. The secondary outcomes are composite endpoint, left ventricular ejection fraction, blood troponin T/I, cardiothoracic ratio, life quality scale, scores of the four traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnostic methods. DISCUSSION: Standardized western medications together with TCM have been extensively used in China and have developed into a comprehensive treatment model. The trial will provide clinical research evidence for application of complementary treatment with intravenous Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection on decompensated IHF. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study protocol has been listed in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR-IPR-15007396, http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=12370 ) on November 6, 2015.

29917204|t|Sestrin2 aggravates oxidative stress of neurons by decreasing the expression of Nrf2.
29917204|a|OBJECTIVE: Oxidative injury is an essential part of the pathological changes of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Sestrin2 (Sesn2), a conserved antioxidant protein, is activated under stress to protect cells against oxidative stress. This study mainly explored the function and mechanism of Sesn2 during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model of primary neurons was established. MTS and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) kit were used to detect cell viability and cell damage by colorimetric method. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) kit and malondialdehyde (MDA) kit were used to access the level of SOD and MDA in neurons. To establish a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, the process of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in animals was simulated. Western blot and immunofluorescence were utilized to further examine the relationship between the expression of Sesn2 and Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2 related factor 2). RESULTS: Sesn2 aggravated neuronal damage and enhanced cell viability in OGD/R model. Intraventricular injection of Sesn2 siRNA lentivirus aggravated nerve function damage in MCAO model, increased cerebral infarction area and water content. Sesn2 overexpression resulted in the increase of total, nuclear levels of Nrf2, as well as the downstream proteins of Nrf2, sulfiredoxin1 (Srx1) and thioredoxin1 (Trx1). On the contrary, after knockdown of Sesn2, we obtained the opposite result. Knockdown of Sesn2 reduced Nrf2, Srx1 and Trx1 levels in rat cerebral cortex in MCAO model. CONCLUSIONS: Sesn2 promoted the transfer of nuclear Nrf2 to the cytoplasm, it decreased the expressions of Nrf2 and its downstream proteins, Srx1 and Trx1. Meanwhile, it increased the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by changing the distribution of Nrf2.

29631145|t|Warm-needle moxibustion for spasticity after stroke: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
29631145|a|BACKGROUND: Spasticity is a common post-stroke complication, and it results in substantial deterioration in the quality of life of patients. Although potential positive effects of warm-needle moxibustion on spasticity after stroke have been observed, evidence on its definitive effect remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to summarize clinical evidence pertaining to therapeutic effects and safety of warm-needle moxibustion for treating spasticity after stroke. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trials were reviewed systematically on the basis of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The report follows the PRISMA statement. METHODS: Ten electronic databases (PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, CBM, CNKI, WanFang, and VIP) were explored, and articles were retrieved manually from two Chinese journals (The Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Zhong Guo Zhen Jiu) through retrospective search. Randomized controlled trials with warm-needle moxibustion as treatment intervention for patients with limb spasm after stroke were included in this review. The risk of bias assessment tool was utilized in accordance with Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0. All included studies reported spasm effect as primary outcome. Effect size was estimated using relative risk, standardized mean difference, or mean difference with a corresponding 95% confidence interval. Review Manager 5.3 was utilized for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twelve randomized controlled trials with certain methodological flaws and risk of bias were included, and they involved a total of 878 participants. Warm-needle moxibustion was found to be superior to electroacupuncture or acupuncture in reducing spasm and in promoting motor function and daily living activities. Pooled results for spasm effect and motor function were significant when warm-needle moxibustion was compared with electroacupuncture or acupuncture. A comparison of daily living activities indicated significant differences between warm-needle moxibustion and electroacupuncture. However, no difference was observed between warm-needle moxibustion and acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Warm-needle moxibustion may be a promising intervention to reduce limb spasm as well as improve motor function and daily living activities for stroke patients with spasticity. However, evidence was not conclusive. Rigorously designed randomized controlled trials with sample sizes larger than that in the included trials should be conducted for verification.

29234926|t|Association between PDE4D rs966221 polymorphism and risk of ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
29234926|a|PDE4D polymorphism (SNP83/rs966221) was reported to be associated with the susceptibility to ischemic stroke (IS), however, the results were inconclusive. An electronic search of Embase, PubMed, CNKI and Wan Fang Date was performed to identify relevant studies published throughout April 2017. A total of 26 studies were enrolled in the analysis. No significant association between the rs9662221 polymorphism and IS was observed in the overall analysis. Nevertheless, in the subgroup analysis, our results showed a significant association between the SNP83 polymorphism and IS in CC+ CT vs. TT (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38), CT vs.TT (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.29) and C vs. T (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.06-1.48) in Asian population. But we did not found any association in CC vs. CT + TT (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 0.9-1.61) and CC vs. TT (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.91-1.75) in the Asian populations. Meantime, no significant correlations were observed under the five genetic model in Caucasian population (p > 0.05). In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrated that the SNP83 polymorphism in the PDE4D gene might contribute to IS susceptibility especially in Asian populations. Whereas the relationship of the polymorphism to the disease in Caucasian population was still in controversial. In future, additional well designed studies with larger sample sizes are still required to further elucidate this association.

28707073|t|Protective Effects of Spatholobi Caulis Extract on Neuronal Damage and Focal Ischemic Stroke/Reperfusion Injury.
28707073|a|Neuronal apoptotic cell death plays an important role in many neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischemic stroke. Spatholobi Caulis (SC) has been widely used in traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, viral infection, and anemia. However, the protective effects of SC extract (SCE) against apoptotic cell death in the brain have not been reported. We investigated the protective effects of SCE against neuronal injury etoposide-induced neurotoxicity and in rats subjected to focal transient ischemic stroke middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min, followed by 7 days of reperfusion. The in vitro study demonstrated that SCE protected cells against etoposide-induced cell viability loss in SH-SY5Y cells. Apoptotic phenotypes, such as cleaved PARP and caspase-3, and oxidative stress in etoposide-treated cells were ameliorated by SCE treatment. In MCAO-reperfusion injury, SCE promoted neuronal survival and level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by reducing glial activation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the ipsilateral cortex. These results indicated that SCE exerted protective effects under etoposide treatment and in a MCAO-reperfusion model by reducing JNK and p38 MAPK activation. This study presents the first evidence that SCE has therapeutic potential for the treatment of ischemic stroke or neurological disorder-related cell death.

29926828|t|Catgut implantation at acupoints increases the expression of glutamate aspartate transporter and glial glutamate transporter-1 in the brain of rats with spasticity after stroke.
29926828|a|Catgut implantation at acupoints has been shown to alleviate spasticity after stroke in rats. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we used the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke. Three days after surgery, absorbable surgical catgut sutures were implanted at Dazhui (GV14), Jizhong (GV6), Houhui, Guanyuan (CV4) and Zhongwan (CV12). The Zea Longa score was used to assess neurological function. The Modified Ashworth Scale was used to evaluate muscle tension. The 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride assay was used to measure infarct volume. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glial glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) expression. Western blot assay was used to analyze the expression of GLAST and GLT-1. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction were carried out to assess the expression of GLAST and GLT-1 mRNAs. After catgut implantation at the acupoints, neurological function was substantially improved, muscle tension was decreased, and infarct volume was reduced in rats with spasticity after stroke. Furthermore, the expression of GLAST and GLT-1 mRNAs was increased on the injured (left) side. Our findings demonstrate that catgut implantation at acupoints alleviates spasticity after stroke, likely by increasing the expression of GLAST and GLT-1.

29926825|t|Puerarin protects rat brain against ischemia/reperfusion injury by suppressing autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway.
29926825|a|Puerarin suppresses autophagy to alleviate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and accumulating evidence indicates that the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway regulates the activation of the autophagy pathway through the coordinated phosphorylation of ULK1. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of puerarin and its role in modulating autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with puerarin, 50 or 100 mg/kg, daily for 7 days. Then, 30 minutes after the final administration, rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 minutes. Then, after 24 hours of reperfusion, the Longa score and infarct volume were evaluated in each group. Autophagosome formation was observed by transmission electron microscopy. LC3, Beclin-1 p62, AMPK, mTOR and ULK1 protein expression levels were examined by immunofluorescence and western blot assay. Puerarin substantially reduced the Longa score and infarct volume, and it lessened autophagosome formation in the hippocampal CA1 area following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with puerarin (50 or 100 mg/kg) reduced Beclin-1 expression and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, as well as p-AMPK and pS317-ULK1 levels. In comparison, it increased p62 expression. Furthermore, puerarin at 100 mg/kg dramatically increased the levels of p-mTOR and pS757-ULK1 in the hippocampus on the ischemic side. Our findings suggest that puerarin alleviates autophagy by activating the APMK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway. Thus, puerarin might have therapeutic potential for treating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

30134784|t|Predictors of mortality and recurrent stroke within five years of intracerebral hemorrhage.
30134784|a|Objective There are limited studies exploring prognosis after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in Chinese populations. Thus, we evaluated the risk factors and predictors of mortality and recurrent stroke in a large clinical cohort at a single institution. Methods We analysed consecutive cases of spontaneous ICH at admission to our hospital from September 2010 to December 2016. Independent predictors of mortality at one month and five year follow-up, as well as stroke recurrence were analysed. Results A total of 1187 cases were included (33.5% women). The one month case fatality rate was 12.5%, and the five year mortality rate was 22.2%. In the multivariate analysis, diabetes was an independent predictor of one month case fatality, and older age (≥65 years) was an independent predictor of five year mortality. Brain stem hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage were independent predictors of both short- and long-term mortality. The overall recurrence rate was 32.5% among one month survivors. Conclusion Predictors of recurrent stroke were older females, hypertension, diabetes, and brain stem hemorrhage. These findings may help to determine specific treatment strategies and improve quality of health care for such patients.

29695462|t|Brain Ischemia Induces Diversified Neuroantigen-Specific T-Cell Responses That Exacerbate Brain Injury.
29695462|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Autoimmune responses can occur when antigens from the central nervous system are presented to lymphocytes in the periphery or central nervous system in several neurological diseases. However, whether autoimmune responses emerge after brain ischemia and their impact on clinical outcomes remains controversial. We hypothesized that brain ischemia facilitates the genesis of autoimmunity and aggravates ischemic brain injury. METHODS: Using a mouse strain that harbors a transgenic T-cell receptor to a central nervous system antigen, MOG35-55 (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) epitope (2D2), we determined the anatomic location and involvement of antigen-presenting cells in the development of T-cell reactivity after brain ischemia and how T-cell reactivity impacts stroke outcome. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and photothrombotic stroke models were used in this study. We also quantified the presence and status of T cells from brain slices of ischemic patients. RESULTS: By coupling transfer of labeled MOG35-55-specific (2D2) T cells with tetramer tracking, we show an expansion in reactivity of 2D2 T cells to MOG91-108 and MOG103-125 in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and photothrombotic stroke models. This reactivity and T-cell activation first occur locally in the brain after ischemia. Also, microglia act as antigen-presenting cells that effectively present MOG antigens, and depletion of microglia ablates expansion of 2D2 reactive T cells. Notably, the adoptive transfer of neuroantigen-experienced 2D2 T cells exacerbates Th1/Th17 responses and brain injury. Finally, T-cell activation and MOG-specific T cells are present in the brain of patients with ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that brain ischemia activates and diversifies T-cell responses locally, which exacerbates ischemic brain injury.

29950058|t|[Analysis of protective effects of Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang against ischemic stroke by combining traditional Chinese medicine pathogenesis and efficacy with modern pathology and pharmacology].
29950058|a|Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang is a classical Chinese formulas treating Shaoyang syndrome complicated with Yangming syndrome according to Treatise on Febrile Diseases. This formula is used in mental disorder, nervous system, gynecologic, andrologic, and cardiovascular disease. However, its therapeutic effect on ischemia stroke and its mechanism is far from clear. In clinical practice, we have found that this formula is effective in treating ischemic stroke, which can shorten the course of the disease and reduce recurrence. The characteristics of this formula include: Shaoyang cardinal disadvantageous syndrome, mental and nervous symptoms, retained fluid punched upward syndrome and accumulation of heat in the stomach and intestines. By combining traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pathogenesis and efficacy with modern pathology and pharmacology, we proposed that the TCM pathogenesis of stroke, which is characterized by hyperactivity of heat combining with phlegm, stasis and water drink, is consistent with syndromes and corresponding pathology targeted by Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang, including the stress brain edema zone around the ischemic lesion, the increase of intracranial pressure, the excitement of sympathetic nerve, the release of monoamine neurotransmitter, the hypofunction of autonomic nervous system after stroke, and gastrointestinal stress response. Furthermore, the pharmacological mechanism of Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang is concentrated on regulation the neuroendocrinology system centered by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), participating in the process of neuron regeneration and apoptosis, oxidative stress, hyperactivity of sympathetic nerve, and inflammatory reaction. These pathological processes are consistent with the pathological changes after ischemic stroke. Therefore, Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang is a key formula for treating ischemic stroke.

29945368|t|[Quantitative proteomic research of biological basis of Buyang Huanwu decoction therapy for cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome].
29945368|a|Chinese medicine Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHW) is widely used in treating cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome, but the pharmacological basis is still not clear. This study aims to uncover the biological basis of BYHW therapy for cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome using label-free proteomic technology. Using Qi deficiency and blood stasis rat cerebral infarction model as the research object, the protein expression of rat brain tissue was compared among the sham operation group, the model group and the drug group. Quantitative analysis of the 3 groups of tissue samples detected 3 959, 3 996 and 4 055 proteins in the sham operation group, the model group and the drug group, respectively. Take model group as the control group, 391 proteins were identified to be upregulated or downregulated for more than 2 folds. Biological analysis and functional enrichment of the differentially expressed proteins revealed that BYHW may treat cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome through energy metabolism, nervous system and several signal pathways. This study preliminarily revealed the pharmacological mechanism of BYHW at the protein level, and provided a molecular basis for clinical treatment and traditional Chinese medicine research on cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome.

29855360|t|Synergistic effect of acupuncture and mirror therapy on post-stroke upper limb dysfunction: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
29855360|a|BACKGROUND: Upper limb dysfunction is common after stroke, posing an important challenge for post-stroke rehabilitation. The clinical efficacy of acupuncture for the recovery of post-stroke upper limb function has been previously demonstrated. Mirror therapy (MT) has also been found to be effective. However, the effects of acupuncture and MT have not been systematically compared. This trial aims to elucidate the synergistic effects of acupuncture and MT on upper limb dysfunction after stroke. METHODS: A 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial will be conducted at the rehabilitation hospitals affiliated with Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. A total of 136 eligible subjects will be randomly divided into acupuncture treatment (AT), MT, combined treatment, and control groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. All subjects will receive conventional treatment. The interventions will be performed 5 days per week for 4 weeks. AT, MT, and combined treatment will be performed for 30 min per day (combined treatment: AT 15 min + MT 15 min). The primary outcomes in this study will be the mean change in scores on both the FMA and WMFT from baseline to 4 weeks intervention and at 12 weeks follow-up between the two groups and within groups. The secondary outcomes are the mean change in the scores on the Visual Analogue Scale, Stroke Impact Scale, and modified Barthel index. Medical abstraction of adverse events will be assessed at each visit. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will demonstrate the synergistic effect of acupuncture and MT on upper limb motor dysfunction after stroke. In addition, whether AT and MT, either combined or alone, are more effective than the conventional treatment in the management of post-stroke upper limb dysfunction will also be determined. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR-IOR-17011118 . Registered on April 11, 2017. Version number: 01.2016.09.1.

29843688|t|Huatuo Zaizao pill ameliorates cognitive impairment of APP/PS1 transgenic mice by improving synaptic plasticity and reducing Aβ deposition.
29843688|a|BACKGROUND: It is well known that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory deficits and cognitive decline. Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and synaptic dysfunction play important roles in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Huatuo Zaizao pill (HT) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that has been used clinically for many years in China, mainly for post-stroke rehabilitation and cognitive decline; however, the mechanism of cognitive function is not clear. In this study, we investigated the effect of HT on hippocampal synaptic function, Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in APP/PS1 AD transgenic mice. METHOD: Six-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice were randomly divided into control, HT-treated, and memantine (MEM)-treated groups. Then, these groups were orally administered vehicle (for the control), HT (0.25 g/kg) and MEM (5 mg/kg) respectively for 4 weeks. The Morris water maze, Novel Object Recognition, and Open field tests were used to assess cognitive behavioral changes. We evaluated the effects of HT on neuronal excitability, membrane ion channel activity, and synaptic plasticity in acute hippocampal slices by combining electrophysiological extracellular tests. Synaptic morphology in the hippocampus was investigated by electron microscopy. Western blotting was used to assess synaptic-associated protein and Aβ production and degrading levels. Immunofluorescence staining was used to determine the relative integrated density. RESULTS: HT can ameliorate hippocampus-dependent memory deficits and improve synaptic dysfunction by reversing LTP impairment in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Moreover, HT reduces amyloid plaque deposition by regulating α-secretase and γ-secretase levels. CONCLUSION: HT can improve the learning and memory function of APP/PS1 transgenic mice by improving synaptic function and reducing amyloid plaque deposition.

29844404|t|DSGOST regulates resistance via activation of autophagy in gastric cancer.
29844404|a|Danggui-Sayuk-Ga-Osuyu-Saenggang-Tang (DSGOST in Korean, Danggui-Sini-Jia-Wuzhuyu-Shengian-Tang in Chinese, and Tokishigyakukagoshuyushokyoto (TJ-38) in Japanese), a well-known traditional Korean/Chinese/Japanese medicine, has long been used to treat vascular diseases such as Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). However, anticancer effect of DSGOST remains elusive. In this study, we checked if DSGOST has an anticancer effect against gastric cancer cells, and investigated the mechanisms underlying DSGOST resistance. Moreover, DSGOST regulates chemoresistance in cisplatin-treated gastric cancer cells. Interestingly, DSGOST treatment induced the accumulation of GFP-LC3 puncta and increased the level of autophagy markers, such as LC3-II, ATG5, and Beclin-1, indicating activated autophagy. Furthermore, DSGOST could activate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and exosomes via induction of autophagy. DSGOST in combination with TGFβ also induced autophagy and EMT. However, autophagy inhibition induces DSGOST-mediated cell death in gastric cancer cells. In addition, autophagy inhibition blocks the activation of DSGOST-mediated EMT markers including N-cadherin, Snail, Slug, vimentin, β-catenin, p-Smad2, and p-Smad3. Taken together, these findings indicated that prosurvival autophagy was one of the mechanisms involved in the resistance of gastric cancer to DSGOST. Targeting the inhibition of autophagy could be an effective therapeutic approach to overcome resistance to DSGOST in gastric cancer.

29872270|t|Pharmacological activities, mechanisms of action, and safety of salidroside in the central nervous system.
29872270|a|The primary objective of this review article was to summarize comprehensive information related to the neuropharmacological activity, mechanisms of action, toxicity, and safety of salidroside in medicine. A number of studies have revealed that salidroside exhibits neuroprotective activities, including anti-Alzheimer's disease, anti-Parkinson's disease, anti-Huntington's disease, anti-stroke, anti-depressive effects, and anti-traumatic brain injury; it is also useful for improving cognitive function, treating addiction, and preventing epilepsy. The mechanisms underlying the potential protective effects of salidroside involvement are the regulation of oxidative stress response, inflammation, apoptosis, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, neurotransmission, neural regeneration, and the cholinergic system. Being free of side effects makes salidroside potentially attractive as a candidate drug for the treatment of neurological disorders. It is evident from the available published literature that salidroside has potential use as a beneficial therapeutic medicine with high efficacy and low toxicity to the central nervous system. However, the definite target protein molecules remain unclear, and clinical trials regarding this are currently insufficient; thus, guidance for further research on the molecular mechanisms and clinical applications of salidroside is urgent.

29951105|t|Structural Changes Induced by Acupuncture in the Recovering Brain after Ischemic Stroke.
29951105|a|The aim of this study was to observe the grey matter (GM) tissue changes of ischemic stroke patients, to explore the therapy responses and possible mechanism of acupuncture. 21 stroke patients were randomly assigned to receive either acupuncture plus conventional (Group A) or only conventional (Group B) treatments for 4 weeks. All patients in both groups accepted resting-state functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) scan before and after treatment, and the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was performed to detect the cerebral grey structure changes. The modified Barthel index (MBI) was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect. Compared with the patients in Group B, the patients in Group A exhibited a more significant enhancement of the changes degree of MBI from pre- to post-treatment intervention. VBM analyses found that after treatment the patients in Group A showed extensive changes in GMV. In Group A, the left frontal lobe, precentral gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and middle temporal gyrus significantly increased, and the right frontal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, and middle cingulate cortex decreased (P < 0.05, corrected). In addition, left anterior cingulate cortex and left middle temporal gyrus are positively related to the increase in MBI score (P < 0.05, corrected). In Group B, right precentral gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus increased (P < 0.05, corrected). In conclusion, acupuncture can evoke pronounced structural reorganization in the frontal areas and the network of DMN areas, which may be the potential therapy target and the potential mechanism where acupuncture improved the motor and cognition recovery.

29951543|t|Psychometric Properties of the Chinese (Putonghua) Version of the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS-P) in Subacute Poststroke Patients without Neglect.
29951543|a|Background: Oxford Cognitive Screen is designed for assessing cognitive functions of poststroke patients. This study was aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Chinese (Putonghua) version of the Oxford Cognitive Screen-Putonghua (OCS-P) for use among poststroke patients without neglect. Methods: Expert review panel evaluated content validity of the Chinese-translated items. After pilot tested the translated items, the patients and healthy participants completed the OCS-P as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-ChiB) and Goldenberg's test. A group of patients completed OCS-P for the second time within seven days. Data analyses included confirmatory factor analysis, item difficulty and item-total correlation, inter- and intrarater reliability, internal consistency, and between-group discrimination. Results: One hundred patients and 120 younger (n = 60) or older (n = 60) healthy participants completed all the tests. Modifications were required for items in the "Picture Naming", "Orientation", and "Sentence Reading" subscales. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a three-factor structure for the OCS-P subscales. The internal consistency coefficients for the three identified test dimensions were 0.30 to 0.52 (Cronbach's alpha). Construct validity coefficients between the OCS-P and MoCA-ChiB subscales were 0.45 < r < 0.79 (p < 0.001) and the "Praxis" subscale of OCS-P and Goldenberg's test was r = 0.72 (p < 0.001). The interrater reliability coefficients for the subscales were in general higher than the intrarater reliability coefficients. The "Picture Naming" and "Numerical Cognition" subscales were the most significant (p = 0.003) for differentiating patient participants from their older healthy counterpart. Conclusion: This study generated satisfactory evidence on the content validity, substantive validity, construct validity, inter- and intrarater reliability, and known-group discrimination of the OCS-P. They support its application among poststroke patients who speak Putonghua. Future studies could review the existing five-dimension domains for improving its structural validity and internal consistency as well as generate evidence of the OCS-P for use among the poststroke patients with neglect.

29895489|t|Shengui Sansheng San extraction is an angiogenic switch via regulations of AKT/mTOR, ERK1/2 and Notch1 signal pathways after ischemic stroke.
29895489|a|BACKGROUND: As a traditional Chinese herbal formula, Shengui Sansheng San (SSS) has been employed for stroke treatment more than 300 years. PURPOSE: We hypothesize that SSS extraction is an angiogenic switch in penumbra post-stroke, and corresponding mechanisms are investigated. METHODS: In present study, rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAo) and were treated with low, middle and high doses of SSS extraction. We assessed neurological function and survival rate, and measured infarct volume by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining on day 7 after ischemia. von Willebrand factor (vWF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1α) /chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) axis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) as well as protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) /hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Notch1 signaling pathways were respectively investigated by immunofluorescence assay or western blotting in vivo and oxygen-glucose-deprived (OGD) brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs); simultaneously, wound healing of BMECs and tube formation assay were administrated. RESULTS: Compared to MCAo group, SSS extraction could significantly improve neurological functional scores, survival rate and cerebral infarct volume, enhance vWF+ vascular density and perimeter, SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis, VEGF expression, as well as activate AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α and ERK1/2 and inhibit Notch1 pathways in penumbra. In vitro, containing SSS extraction serum increased BMEC migration, capillary formation and VEGF expression via up-regulations of AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways in OGD BMECs, but ERK inhibitor (U0126) reversed the result of VEGF expression in high dose of SSS group. Additionally, VEGFR2 and Notch1 expressions were suppressed by containing SSS extraction serum. All results were in dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Our study firstly demonstrates that SSS extraction is an angiogenic switch. Due to suppressed VEGFR2/Notch1 cascades and activated AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signals in BMECs, a feedback loop of angiogenic homeostasis is established. Furthermore, the comprehensive mediations of SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis, AKT/mTOR/HIF-α, ERK1/2 and Notch1 pathways in penumbra contribute to the improvements of neurological function, survival rate and infarct volume post-stroke.

29748641|t|Xiaoshuan enteric-coated capsule alleviates cognitive impairment by enhancing hippocampal glucose metabolism, hemodynamics and neuroplasticity of rat with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.
29748641|a|Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is identified as a critical risk factor of dementia in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Xiaoshuan enteric-coated capsule (XSECC) is a compound Chinese medicine approved by Chinese State Food and Drug Administration for promoting brain remodeling and plasticity after stroke. The present study aimed to explore the potential of XSECC to improve cognitive function after CCH and further investigate the underlying mechanisms. CCH was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) in rats. XSECC (420 or 140 mg/kg) treatment remarkably reversed BCCAO-induced cognitive deficits. Notably, after XSECC treatment, magnetic resonance angiography combined with arterial spin labeling noninvasively demonstrated significantly improved hippocampal hemodynamics, and 18F-FDG PET/CT showed enhanced hippocampal glucose metabolism. In addition, XSECC treatment markedly alleviated neuropathologies and improved neuroplasticity in the hippocampus. More importantly, XSECC treatment facilitated axonal remodeling by regulating the phosphorylation of axonal growth related proteins including protein kinase B (AKT), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) in the hippocampus. Taken together, the present study demonstrated the beneficial role of XSECC in alleviating BCCAO-induced cognitive deficits by enhancing hippocampal glucose metabolism, hemodynamics and neuroplasticity, suggesting that XSECC could be a useful strategy in cerebral hypoperfusion state and dementia.

29747670|t|The efficacy and safety of Jiedu Tongluo granules for treating post-stroke depression with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
29747670|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common psychiatric complication after a stroke. The most frequently used antidepressants are selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), however, these exhibit a series of side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat PSD with few side effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jiedu Tongluo granules for treating PSD with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome. METHODS: The planned study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Eighty participants will be randomly assigned to receive either treatment or placebo. The treatment group will receive Jiedu Tongluo granules (JDTLG) with conventional treatment, and the placebo group will receive placebo with conventional treatment for 8 weeks. The primary outcome is the effectiveness of JDTLG on depression after 8 weeks treatment, which is defined as a decrease of 50% or more in 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) score or clinical recovery (score < 7). Secondary outcomes are improvement in neurological function, degree of independence, activities of daily living, and TCM syndrome at each visit, which will be measured with National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index (BI) and TCM scale, respectively. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and small-molecule metabolites will be monitored to explore the mechanism of action of JDTLG on PSD. Safety measures include vital signs, results of electrocardiography, laboratory index (full blood count, kidney and liver function tests) and adverse events. DISCUSSION: The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the therapeutic effects and safety of JDTLG in individuals with PSD with concomitant qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome. If successful, the outcome of this trial will provide a viable treatment option for PSD patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03147053 . Registered on 27 April 2017.

29853968|t|Long-Zhi Decoction Medicated Serum Promotes Angiogenesis in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells Based on Autophagy.
29853968|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) is a fatal subtype of stroke that lacks effective treatments. Angiogenesis following IS is an effective response that mediates brain recovery and repair. Our previous study demonstrated that long-zhi decoction (LZD), a Chinese herbal formula, promoted angiogenesis in rats of IS model. To further investigate the association between the proangiogenic mechanism of an LZD-medicated serum and cellular autophagy, we evaluated its promotional effect on angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. We used HUVECs subjected to H2O2 to induce injury and observed the effects of the LZD-medicated serum treatment. Cell-based assays included proliferation, migration, and tube formation. To assess the extent of autophagy, transmission electron microscopy was used to measure the number of autophagosomes. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting were performed to evaluate the autophagy-related protein of LC3-II and Beclin-1. The LZD-medicated serum promoted proliferation, migration, and tube formation in HUVECs. The LZD-medicated serum also increased the autophagosomes and the autophagic protein expressions of LC3-II and Beclin-1. The proangiogenic and autophagic activity of LZD provides new cogitations to its clinical application and may lead to potential drug development for treating various vascular diseases, especially in the elderly, in the future.

29363325|t|Short-term high-glucose treatment decreased abundance of Orai1 protein through posttranslational mechanisms in rat mesangial cells.
29363325|a|The short-term effect of high-glucose (HG) treatment on store-operated Ca2+ entry in mesangial cells (MCs) is not well-known. The aim of the present study was to determine whether and how HG treatment for a short period altered protein abundance of Orai1, the channel mediating store-operated Ca2+ entry in MCs. Rat and human MCs were exposed to HG (25 mM) for 2, 4, 8, and 24 h, and the abundance of Orai1 protein was significantly decreased at the time points of 8 and 16 h. Consistently, HG treatment for 8 h significantly reduced store-operated Ca2+ entry in rat MCs. However, HG treatment for the same time periods did not alter the levels of Orai1 transcript. Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, did not affect the HG-induced decrease of Orai1 protein, suggesting a posttranslational mechanism was involved. However, the HG effect on Orai1 protein was significantly attenuated by MG132 (a ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor) and NH4Cl (a lysosomal pathway inhibitor). Furthermore, HG treatment for 8 h stimulated ubiquitination of Orai1 protein. We further found that polyethylene glycol-catalase, an antioxidant, significantly blunted the HG-induced reduction of Orai1 protein. In support of involvement of reactive oxygen species in the HG effects, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) itself significantly decreased abundance of Orai1 protein and increased the level of ubiquitinated Orai1. Taken together, these results suggest that a short-term HG treatment decreased abundance of Orai1 protein in MCs by promoting the protein degradation through the ubiquitination-proteasome and -lysosome mechanisms. This HG-stimulated posttranslational mechanism was mediated by H2O2.

29725359|t|Extracellular vesicles in mesenchymal stromal cells: A novel therapeutic strategy for stroke.
29725359|a|A stroke is a focal cerebral insult that frequently causes severe neurological deficit and mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated that multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) hold great promise for neurovascular remodeling and neurological function recovery following a stroke. Rather than a direct replacement of parenchymal brain cells, the therapeutic mechanism of MSCs is suggested to be the secretion of soluble factors. Specifically, emerging data described MSCs as being able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which contain a variety of cargo including proteins, lipids, DNA and various RNA species. The released EVs can target neurocytes and vascular cells and modify the cell's functions by delivering the cargo, which are considered to mediate the neural restoration effects of MSCs. Therefore, EVs may be developed as a novel cell-free therapy for neurological disorders. In the present review, the current advances regarding the components, functions and therapeutic potential of EVs are summarized and the use of MSC-derived EVs as a promising approach in the treatment of stroke are highlighted.

28820606|t|The Analysis of Constitutions of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Relation to Cerebral Infarction in a Chinese Sample.
28820606|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between the constitutions of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and patients with cerebral infarction (CI) in a Chinese sample. METHODS: A total of 3748 participants with complete data were available for data analysis. All study subjects underwent complete clinical baseline characteristics' evaluation, including a physical examination and response to a structured, nurse-assisted, self-administrated questionnaire. A population of 2010 neutral participants were used as the control group. Multiple variable regression (MLR) were employed to estimate the relationship between constitutions of TCM and the outcome. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the association of body constitution of TCM and CI. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Communications and healthcare centers in Shanghai. SUBJECTS: A total of 3748 participants with complete data were available for data analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: All study subjects underwent complete clinical baseline characteristics' evaluation, including a physical examination and response to a structured, nurse-assisted, self-administrated questionnaire. A population of 2010 neutral participants were used as the control group. MLR were employed to estimate the relationship between constitutions of TCM and the outcome. RESULT: The prevalence of CI was 2.84% and 4.66% in neutral participants and yang-deficient participants (p = 0.012), respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between yang deficiency and CI. After adjustment for relevant potential confounding factors, the MLR detected significant associations between yang deficiency and CI (odds ratio = 1.44, p = 0.093). CONCLUSION: A yang-deficient constitution was significantly and independently associated with CI. A higher prevalence of CI was found in yang-deficient participants as compared with neutral participants.

29276014|t|Early Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors for Recovery after Stroke: A Meta-Analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis.
29276014|a|BACKGROUND: Potential benefits and risks of early (≤30 days from stroke onset) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) treatment for neurologic functional recovery after stroke are not fully understood. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify randomized controlled trials that assessed SSRI medications during the initial ictus after stroke versus placebo. Primary outcome was decrease in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Secondary outcomes included the improvement of Barthel index, functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 at the end of follow-up), the incidence of depression, and adverse events including diarrhea, insomnia, hepatic enzyme disorders, seizure, and intracranial hemorrhage. We used fixed effects models or random effects models to estimate weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to heterogeneity. RESULTS: Eight trials were included, with 1549 patients. Compared with placebo, decrease in NIHSS was greater in SSRI-treated patients (WMD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.31-1.33; P = .002). Trial sequential analysis showed that the cumulative z curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit, establishing sufficient and conclusive evidence. Early SSRI treatment also promoted Barthel index (WMD, 5.32; 95% CI, 1.65-8.99; P = .005) and functional independence (RR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.82-3.55; P < .0001). There was no difference in the incidence of depression and adverse events between groups. No evidence of publication bias was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The early SSRIs treatment reduces the defective neurologic function in patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke.

29633164|t|Xueshuantong Injection (Lyophilized) Attenuates Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by the Activation of Nrf2-VEGF Pathway.
29633164|a|Xueshuantong injection (Lyophilized, XST), extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Panax notoginseng, has neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia. Revascularization of ischemic tissue is good for the therapy of cerebrovascular disease. In this study, angiogenic potentiality and possible mechanism of XST for cerebral ischemia were explored. Rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and then intraperitoneally administered with XST daily for 3 or 7 consecutive days. The neurological function deficits, and endogenous antioxidant capacity were evaluated. Post-stroke angiogenesis and vascularization were assessed by ELISA and immunohistochemical staining. Transcription levels of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1 in brain tissues were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. The results showed that XST could remarkably ameliorate neuronal functional deficit, promote angiogenesis and vascularization after MCAO. The mechanism of angiogenesis might be related to endogenous antioxidant capacity and Nrf2 pathway. In conclusion, administered XST for 7 days after stroke could significantly improve functional recovery and promote angiogenesis, that might be related to Nrf2 signaling pathway. These findings could provide scientific evidence for the use of XST in cerebral ischemic diseases and provide theoretical support for further studies.

29564698|t|Gualou Guizhi Granule Protects Against Oxidative Injury by Activating Nrf2/ARE Pathway in Rats and PC12 Cells.
29564698|a|Stroke involves numerous pathophysiological processes and oxidative stress is considered as a main cellular event in its pathogenesis. The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway plays a key role in inducing phase II detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant proteins and is now considered as a interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of stroke. The objective of this study is to investigate the protective effect of Gualou Guizhi granule (GLGZG) against oxidative stress and explore the protective mechanism of the Nrf2/ARE pathway. In vivo, administration of GLGZG in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia significantly suppressed oxidative injury by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione level and decreasing reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels. Western blot analysis showed that GLGZG induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and combined with real-time PCR results, which indicated that GLGZG up-regulated the Nrf2/ARE pathway. In addition, in cultured PC12 cells, GLGZG protected against H2O2 induced oxidative injury and activated the Nrf2/ARE pathway. All the results demonstrated that GLGZG in the management of cerebral ischemia and H2O2 induced oxidative injury may be associated with activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.

29933680|t|[Effect of Longxuetongluo capsule in protecting vascular endothelial cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis].
29933680|a|Focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion is an essential process during ischemic stroke. The apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is an important cause for brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia. Longxuetongluo capsule (LTC) has been used for the treatment of ischemic stroke in clinic. However, its underlying action mechanism is still unclear. This study aimed to verify the protective effect and mechanisms of LTC on HUVEC cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury through MTT, LDH, flow cytometry, AO/EB staining and western blot assays. As a result, OGD/R significantly decreased the viability of HUVEC cells, which was significantly improved by LTC. LDH release assay showed that OGD/R significantly increased the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and LTC dramatically reduced the OGD/R-induced LDH release. Further mechanism study indicated that LTC dose-dependently inhibited the cleavage of PARP, caspase 3, and caspase 9 induced by OGD/R, suggesting that LTC could inhibit the activation of caspase 3/9 apoptosis pathway in the OGD/R-induced apoptosis of HUVEC cells. In conclusion, LTC could protect HUVEC cells against OGD/R injury by inhibiting the activation of mitochondria-related caspase 3/9 apoptosis pathway.

29764541|a|OBJECTIVE: Tianjin, as the earliest city to open up, the exchange of Chinese and Western cultures also started earlier. Therefore, today's emergency medicine system with integrated features of Chinese and Western medicine is formed. Professor Wang Jinda, who works in Tianjin First Center Hospital, makes the theory of "treating bronchitis and treating diseases" and "three methods of three syndromes" for the treatment of severe diseases such as sepsis. The surgical aspect is the treatment of acute abdomen with the combination of Chinese and Western medicine which is proposed by Academician Wu Xianzhong who worked in Tianjin Nankai Hospital. In the aspect of acupuncture and moxibustion, Professor Guo Yi, who works in Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, provides the twelve Jing points blood-letting therapy for cerebral diseases such as stroke. Professor Liu Xinqiao from the First Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine also conducts in-depth studies on brain protection after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). He proposes the importance of traditional Chinese medicine in addition to mild hypothermia and neuroprotective agents. The author summarized these achievements, in light of which looked forward to the future and proposed the concept of establishing a multi-specialist collaboration and an emergency center with obvious characteristics of integrated Chinese and Western medicine, which would pave the way for the development of integrated Chinese and Western medicine first aid.

29755351|t|Gastrodin Attenuates Bilateral Common Carotid Artery Occlusion-Induced Cognitive Deficits via Regulating Aβ-Related Proteins and Reducing Autophagy and Apoptosis in Rats.
29755351|a|Gastrodin (GAS), an active constituent extracted from Gastrodia elata Blume, is used to treat ischemic stroke, epilepsy, dizziness, and dementia for centuries in China. This study examined its effects on vascular dementia (VD) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. VD was established by ligation of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). A total of 7 days after BCCAO surgery, GAS (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) was orally administered for 28 consecutive days to evaluate therapeutic effects. Cognitive function was tested by the Morris water maze. The neuronal morphological changes were examined via Hematoxylin-Eosin staining. Flow cytometry was used for evaluating apoptosis in the hippocampi. The target protein expression was examined by Western blot. The results showed that BCCAO induced cognitive impairment, hippocampus CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neuron damage, beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, excessive autophagy, and apoptosis. GAS treatment significantly improved BCCAO-induced cognitive deficits and hippocampus neuron damage. Molecular analysis revealed that GAS exerted the protective effect via reducing the levels of Aβ1-40/42, APP, and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 expression, and increasing Aβ-related protein, a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10, and insulin degrading enzyme expression. Meanwhile, GAS inhibited excessive autophagy via decreasing Beclin-1, LC3-II, and p62 levels. Furthermore, GAS inhibited apoptosis through the downregulation of Bax and upregulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, P38 MAPK signaling pathway was involved in the process. Our findings demonstrate that GAS was effective in the treatment of BCCAO-induced VD via targeting Aβ-related protein formation and inhibiting autophagy and apoptosis of hippocampus neurons.

29760990|t|Spatial and temporal identification of cerebral infarctions based on multiphoton microscopic imaging.
29760990|a|Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and permanent disability worldwide. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) of variable duration times could be anticipated to result in varying degrees of injury that evolve spatially over time. Therefore, investigations following strokes require information concerning the spatiotemporal dimensions of the ischemic core as well as of perilesional areas. In the present study, multiphoton microscopy (MPM) based on two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG) was applied to image such pathophysiological events. The ischemic time-points for evaluation were set at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after MCAO. Our results demonstrated that MPM has the ability to not only identify the normal and ischemic brain regions, but also reveal morphological changes of the cortex and striatum at various times following permanent MCAO. These findings corresponded well with the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue images. With the technologic progression of miniaturized imaging devices, MPM can be developed into an effective diagnostic and monitoring tool for ischemic stroke.

29849724|t|Shexiang Baoxin Pills as an Adjuvant Treatment for Chronic Heart Failure: A System Review and Meta-Analysis.
29849724|a|Background: Shexiang Baoxin pills (SXBXP), as a Traditional Chinese Medicine, are widely used for chronic heart failure in China. It is essential to systematically assess the efficacy and safety of SXBXP as an adjuvant treatment for chronic heart failure. Methods: Seven English and Chinese electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CBM, Wanfang, VMIS, and CNKI) were searched from inception to July 2017. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of eligible studies. Meta-analysis was performed by Review Manager 5.3. Results: A total of 27 RCTs with 2637 participants were included in this review. Compared to conventional treatment, SXBXP combined with conventional treatment showed potent efficacy when it came to the total efficacy rate (OR, 3.88; 95% CI, 2.87, 5.26; P < 0.00001), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (MD = -66.95; 95% CI, -108.57, -25.34; P = 0.002), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) (MD = -0.15; 95% CI, -0.21, -0.09; P < 0.00001), six-minute walking distance (6-MWD) (MD = 38.57; 95% CI, 28.47, 48.67; P < 0.00001), cardiac output (CO) (MD = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.68, 0.99; P < 0.00001), and Stroke Volume (SV) (MD = 7.43; 95% CI, 4.42, 10.44, P < 0.00001). The pooled subgroup analysis indicated that there was a significant difference between SXBXP plus conventional treatment and conventional treatment alone in short term course (OR = 3.51; 95% CI, 2.28, 5.40; P < 0.00001), in middle period of treatment (OR = 5.01; 95% CI, 2.61, 9.60; P < 0.00001), and in long-term course (OR = 3.77; 95% CI, 2.13, 6.67; P < 0.00001). No serious adverse events or reactions were mentioned in these RCTs. Conclusions: As an adjuvant drug, this study suggested that SXBXP provide an obvious efficacy for the treatment of CHF. However, due to small samples and generally low quality studies being applied in this study, more rigorous and well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.

29360497|t|Metabolomics-based mechanisms exploration of Huang-Lian Jie-Du decoction on cerebral ischemia via UPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis on rat serum.
29360497|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huang-Lian Jie-Du decoction (HLJDD), a traditional formula of Chinese medicine constituted with Rhizoma Coptidis, RadixScutellariae, CortexPhellodendri amurensis and Fructus Gardeniae, exhibits unambiguous therapeutic effect on cerebral ischemia via multi-targets action. Further investigation, however, is still required to explore the relationship between those mechanisms and targets through system approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats of cerebral ischemia were completed by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with reperfusion. Following evaluation of pharmacological actions of HLJDD on MCAO rats, the plasma samples from rats of control, MCAO and HLJDD-treated MCAO groups were prepared strictly and subjected to ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry for metabolites analysis. The raw mass data were imported to MassLynx software for peak detection and alignment, and further introduced to EZinfo 2.0 software for orthogonal projection to latent structures analysis, principal component analysis and partial least-squares-discriminant analysis. The metabolic pathways assay of those potential biomarkers were performed with MetaboAnalyst through the online database, HMDB, Metlin, KEGG and SMPD. Those intriguing metabolic pathways were further investigated via biochemical assay. RESULTS: HLJDD ameliorated the MCAO-induce cerebral damage and blocked the severe inflammation response. There were nineteen different biomarkers identified among control, MCAO and HLJDD-treated MCAO groups. Ten metabolic pathways were proposed from these significant metabolites. Incorporation with the biochemical assay of cerebral tissue, modulation of metabolic stress, regulation glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle and enhancement of cholinergic neurons function were explored that involved in the actions of HLJDD on cerebral ischemia. CONCLUSION: HLJDD achieves therapeutic action on cerebral ischemia via coordinating the basic pathophysiological network of metabolic stress, glutamate metabolism, and acetylcholine levels and function.

29664057|t|Remote Ischemic Postconditioning for Ischemic Stroke: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
29664057|a|Background: Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) appears to protect distant organs from ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). However, cerebral protection results have remained inconclusive. In the present study, a meta-analysis was performed to compare stroke patients with and without RIPostC. Methods: CNKI, WanFang, VIP, CBM, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to July 2016. Data were analyzed using both fixed-effects and random-effects models by Review Manager. For each outcome, risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Results: A total of 13 randomized controlled trials that enrolled a total of 794 study participants who suffered from or are at risk for brain IRI were selected. Compared with controls, RIPostC significantly reduced the recurrence of stroke or transient ischemic attacks (RR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.26-0.55; P < 0.00001). Moreover, it can reduce the levels of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (MD: 1.96; 95% CI: 2.18-1.75; P < 0.00001), modified Rankin Scale score (MD: 0.73; 95% CI: 1.20-0.25; P = 0.00300), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (MD: 4.17; 95% CI: 4.71-3.62; P < 0.00001) between the two groups. There was no side effect of RIPostC using tourniquet cuff around the limb on ischemic stroke treating based on different intervention duration. Conclusion: The present meta-analysis suggests that RIPostC might offer cerebral protection for stroke patients suffering from or are at risk of brain IRI.

29681850|t|Tnfrsf12a-Mediated Atherosclerosis Signaling and Inflammatory Response as a Common Protection Mechanism of Shuxuening Injection Against Both Myocardial and Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injuries.
29681850|a|Shuxuening injection (SXNI) is a widely prescribed herbal medicine of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGB) for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases in China. However, its curative effects on ischemic stroke and heart diseases and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Taking an integrated approach of RNA-seq and network pharmacology analysis, we compared transcriptome profiles of brain and heart ischemia reperfusion injury in C57BL/6J mice to identify common and differential target genes by SXNI. Models for myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) by ligating left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) for 30 min ischemia and 24 h reperfusion and cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI) by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min ischemia and 24 h reperfusion were employed to identify the common mechanisms of SXNI on both cerebral and myocardial ischemia reperfusion. In the CIRI model, ischemic infarct volume was markedly decreased after pre-treatment with SXNI at 0.5, 2.5, and 12.5 mL/kg. In the MIRI model, pre-treatment with SXNI at 2.5 and 12.5 mL/kg improved cardiac function and coronary blood flow and decreased myocardial infarction area. Besides, SXNI at 2.5 mL/kg also markedly reduced the levels of LDH, AST, CK-MB, and CK in serum. RNA-seq analysis identified 329 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brain and 94 DEGs in heart after SXNI treatment in CIRI or MIRI models, respectively. Core analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that atherosclerosis signaling and inflammatory response were top-ranked in the target profiles for both CIRI and MIRI after pre-treatment with SXNI. Specifically, Tnfrsf12a was recognized as an important common target, and was regulated by SXNI in CIRI and MIRI. In conclusion, our study showed that SXNI effectively protects brain and heart from I/R injuries via a common Tnfrsf12a-mediated pathway involving atherosclerosis signaling and inflammatory response. It provides a novel knowledge of active ingredients of Ginkgo biloba on cardio-cerebral vascular diseases in future clinical application.

29309860|t|Effects of total saponins from Trillium tschonoskii rhizome on grey and white matter injury evaluated by quantitative multiparametric MRI in a rat model of ischemic stroke.
29309860|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Trillium tschonoskii rhizome (TTR), a medicinal herb, has been traditionally used to treat traumatic brain injury and headache in China. Although the potential neuroprotective efficacy of TTR has gained increasing interest, the pharmacological mechanism remains unclear. Steroid saponins are the main bioactive components of the herb. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the protective and repair-promoting effects of the total saponins from TTR (TSTT) on grey and white matter damages in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ischemic stroke was induced by MCAO. TSTT and Ginaton (positive control) were administered orally to rats 6h after stroke and daily thereafter. After 15 days of treatment, the survival rate of each group was calculated. We then conducted neurological deficit scores and beam walking test to access the neurological function after ischemic stroke. Subsequently, T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and T2 relaxometry mapping were performed to measure infarct volume and grey and white matter integrity, respectively. Moreover, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was carried out to evaluate the grey and white matter microstructural damage. Additionally, arterial spin labelling (ASL) - cerebral blood flow (CBF) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images provided dynamic information about vascular hemodynamic dysfunction after ischemic stroke. Finally, haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was carried out to evaluate the stroke-induced pathological changes in the brain. RESULTS: The survival rate and neurological behavioural outcomes (Bederson scores and beam walking tests) were markedly ameliorated by TSTT (65mg/kg) treatment within 15 days after ischemic stroke. Moreover, T2WI and T2 relaxometry mapping showed that TSTT (65mg/kg) significantly reduced infarct volume and attenuated grey and white matter injury, respectively, which was confirmed by histopathological evaluation of brain tissue. The results obtained from DTI showed that TSTT (65mg/kg) not only significantly alleviated axonal damage and demyelination, but also promoted axonal remodelling and re-myelination. In addition, TSTT treatment also enhanced vascular signal density and increased CBF in rats after MCAO. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested the potential protective and repair-promoting effects of TSTT on grey and white matter from damage induced by ischemia. This study provides a modern pharmacological basis for the application of TSTT in managing ischemic stroke.

29439994|t|Immediate effect of scalp acupuncture on the gait of patients with subacute intracerebral haemorrhage analysed by three-dimensional motion: secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial.
29439994|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immediate effect of scalp acupuncture on walking pattern, using three-dimensional gait analysis (3D-GA), among patients in the subacute stage of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). METHODS: A subset of 30 patients with subacute ICH participating in a recently published randomised controlled trial who were able to walk independently were assessed by 3D-GA before and immediately after scalp acupuncture treatment (treatment group) or no intervention (control group) and the results presented here as a secondary analysis. The acupuncture manipulation was repeated three times with an interval of 5 min. Spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters during walking were collected and analysed using a 3D motion analysis system. RESULTS: After treatment, there were significant differences between the treatment and control groups in the spatiotemporal parameters of step length, velocity and cadence (p<0.05) and double-limb support. No significant difference was found in step width. When kinematic parameters were evaluated, the treatment group showed a significantly decreased peak pelvic anterior tilt angle and an increased hip extension angle after scalp acupuncture treatment, whereas the control group demonstrated no temporal changes. There were no significant changes in any other kinematic parameters in either group. CONCLUSIONS: As the first exploratory study to investigate the effect of the scalp acupuncture on gait performance in patients with subacute ICH, this secondary analysis of a recent randomised trial suggested an immediate effect of treatment on spatiotemporal parameters. Improvement in gait pattern may be associated with a decreased anterior tilt of the pelvis and augmented hip joint motion during walking. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR-TRC-08000225; Post-results.

29984620|t|Enhanced Neurogenesis and Collaterogenesis by Sodium Danshensu Treatment After Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Mice.
29984620|a|Ischemic stroke remains a serious threat to human life. There are limited effective therapies for the treatment of stroke. We have previously demonstrated that angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the brain play an important role in functional recovery following ischemic stroke. Recent studies indicate that increased arteriogenesis and collateral circulation are determining factors for restoring reperfusion and outcomes of stroke patients. Danshensu, the Salvia miltiorrhiza root extract, is used in treatments of various human ischemic events in traditional Chinese medicine. Its therapeutic mechanism, however, is not well clarified. Due to its proposed effect on angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, we hypothesized that danshensu could benefit stroke recovery through stimulating neurogenesis and collaterogenesis in the post-ischemia brain. Focal ischemic stroke targeting the right sensorimotor cortex was induced in wild-type C57BL6 mice and transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) to label smooth muscle cells of brain arteries. Sodium danshensu (SDS, 700 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 10 min after stroke and once daily until animals were sacrificed. To label proliferating cells, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered, starting on day 3 after ischemia and continued once daily until sacrifice. At 14 days after stroke, SDS significantly increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the peri-infarct region. SDS-treated animals showed increased number of doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells. Greater numbers of proliferating endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were detected in SDS-treated mice 21 days after stroke in comparison with vehicle controls. The number of newly formed neurons labeled by NeuN and BrdU antibodies increased in SDS-treated mice 28 days after stroke. SDS significantly increased the newly formed arteries and the diameter of collateral arteries, leading to enhanced local cerebral blood flow recovery after stroke. These results suggest that systemic sodium danshensu treatment shows significant regenerative effects in the post-ischemic brain, which may benefit long-term functional recovery from ischemic stroke.

28901172|t|Traditional manual acupuncture combined with rehabilitation therapy for shoulder hand syndrome after stroke within the Chinese healthcare system: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
28901172|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of traditional manual acupuncture combined with rehabilitation therapy versus rehabilitation therapy alone for shoulder hand syndrome after stroke. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedicine Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Information Database, Wan Fang Database and reference lists of the eligible studies were searched up to July 2017 for relevant studies. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials that compared the combined effects of traditional manual acupuncture and rehabilitation therapy to rehabilitation therapy alone for shoulder hand syndrome after stroke were included. Two reviewers independently screened the searched records, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias of the included studies. The treatment effect sizes were pooled in a meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies involving 1918 participants were included in this study. Compared to rehabilitation therapy alone, the combined therapy significantly reduced pain on the visual analogue scale and improved limb movement on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale and the performance of activities of daily living (ADL) on the Barthel Index scale or Modified Barthel Index scale. Of these, the visual analogue scale score changes were significantly higher (mean difference = 1.49, 95% confidence interval = 1.15-1.82, P < 0.00001) favoring the combined therapy after treatment, with severe heterogeneity ( I2 = 71%, P = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that traditional manual acupuncture integrated with rehabilitation therapy is more effective in alleviating pain, improving limb movement and ADL. However, considering the relatively low quality of available evidence, further rigorously designed and large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the results.

29723487|t|Clinical investigation and characterization of vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and vertebral artery dominance.
29723487|a|In clinical practice, the vertebral arteries of a patient are often found to be not equal in size and the basilar artery may not be situated in the center. Our observational study showed that vertebral dominance and basilar bending are common, and their occurrence is related to advanced age and hypertension. The right vertebral dominance tends to coincide with left basilar bending, and, vice versa, the left vertebral dominance tends to coincide with right basilar bending. The left vertebral dominance is more common than the right dominance. Vertebral dominance and basilar bending are risk factors for brainstem infarction and transient ischemic attack (TIA) and their early detection can prompt measures to be taken to prevent the onset of brain infarction and TIA.

29563983|t|Protective effects of paeonol on subacute/chronic brain injury during cerebral ischemia in rats.
29563983|a|Ischemic stroke is a highly complex pathological process that is divided into acute, subacute and chronic phases. Paeonol is a biologically active natural product with a variety of pharmacological effects, including those on neuronal activity. However, the effects of paeonol on subacute/chronic ischemic stroke have remained to be elucidated. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of paeonol against subacute and chronic cerebral ischemic injury and to explore the possible underlying mechanisms. Male adult Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham group (treated with saline), a model group [subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and treated with saline] and a paeonol-treated group (MCAO + paeonol at 25 mg/kg). Behavioral impairment, infarct volume and ischemic/contralateral hemispheric ratios were assessed at 72 h and at 28 days after MCAO, respectively. Immunofluorescence was employed to determine the neuronal damage and glial responses after MCAO. Compared with the model group, paeonol treatment significantly attenuated behavioral impairment, ischemic infarct volume and moderate cerebral edema in the ischemic brain at 72 h, as well as brain atrophy at 28 days after reperfusion. Furthermore, paeonol treatment ameliorated neuronal damage in the ischemic core and boundary zone regions at 72 h after reperfusion and in the boundary zone at 28 days after reperfusion. In addition, paeonol treatment reduced the proliferation of astrocytes in the boundary zone, and inhibited microglial activation in the ischemic core and boundary zone regions at 72 h and 28 days after reperfusion. These results demonstrated the protective effects of paeonol against subacute/chronic cerebral ischemia, and the mechanism of action may include subacute/chronic microglial activation and astrocyte proliferation.

29426978|t|Impact of intracranial artery calcification on cerebral hemodynamic changes.
29426978|a|PURPOSE: Intracranial artery calcification (IAC) has been demonstrated to be correlated with ischemic stroke, cognitive decline, and other vascular events by accumulating evidences from both Western and Asian populations. The proposed study aimed to investigate its potential mechanisms by evaluating the blood flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI) of cerebral arteries. METHODS: Consecutive ischemic stroke patients admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital were recruited after excluding those with atrial fibrillation or poor temporal window. Quantitative measurements of IAC severity were assessed on brain CT scans. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography was performed to evaluate the blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and vertebral-basilar artery (VBA). RESULTS: In total, 318 patients were analyzed. Spearman's correlation analysis demonstrated both high MCA systolic flow velocity and high MCA PI were correlated with IAC Agatston score, p < 0.001 individually. Similar correlation was also found between IAC Agatston score and high VBA velocity/high VBA PI, p ≤ 0.001 individually. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed IAC Agatston score was an independent risk factor for high MCA velocity (OR 1.533; 95% CI 1.235-1.903), high VBA velocity (OR 1.964; 95% CI 1.381-2.794), and high VBA PI (OR 1.200; 95% CI 1.016-1.418), respectively. CONCLUSION: Heavier IAC might cause generalized artery flow velocity changes and increased pulsatility index, which may indicate high resistance within cerebrovasculature.

29559579|t|Mean Platelet Volume as a Predictor for Restenosis After Carotid Angioplasty and Stenting.
29559579|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Platelet aggregation plays a vital role in the development of in-stent restenosis (ISR) after carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). Mean platelet volume (MPV) has been suggested as an index of platelet reactivity. This study aimed to investigate the association between MPV and ISR in CAS patients. METHODS: A total of 261 patients with CAS were enrolled. MPV was measured before CAS procedure. Digital subtraction angiography, computed tomographic angiography, or duplex ultrasonography was performed at 6 months and annually after the procedure. ISR was defined as ≥50% stenosis in the treated lesion. Cox regression was used to identify predictors of ISR after CAS. RESULTS: Of the 261 patients with CAS, 46 (17.6%) were determined with ISR during a mean follow-up of 12.1±16.1 months (range, 2.1-120.7). On multivariate analysis, baseline MPV >10.1 fL (hazard ratio, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-8.03), lesion length (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.08), residual stenosis (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.10), and baseline glucose (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.02) were associated with ISR. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated MPV may be associated with ISR after CAS. Patients with high preprocedural MPV may benefit from an intensified antiplatelet therapy after CAS.

29728025|t|[Explore compatibility mechanism of Xingnaojing injection in treating cerebral infarction based on network pharmacology].
29728025|a|This paper aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of Xingnaojing injection and its scientific connotation of compatibility mechanism from a new perspective on bioinformatics and network biology. Based on the analysis function of intergrative pharmacology platform V1.0, the compatibility mechanism of this prescription was investigated by constructing the herbs-compounds-targets network. Seven hundreds and ninety-five targets from the prescription were screened out, then 302 hub nodes were included in drug targets-disease targets network. Enrichment analysis showed that it was related to MAPK cascade, negative/positive regulation of apoptotic process and other biological functions as well as PI3K/AKT, neurotrophin and other signal pathways. The target functions of different drugs were similar, complementing each other, and belonging to the common signaling pathway with asynergistic effect. Based on analysis of core components-key targets-main pathway network, among totally 25 core components and 29 key targets, musk had 15 and 25 respectively.SLC1A2, AR, PGR, CAT, NMDA receptors and other targets were associated with cerebral infarction. Musk, gardenia and borneol compatibility can play a bidirectional regulation of apoptosis; musk and gardenia showed synergistic effect on Ras signaling pathway, indicating that musk was the main ingredient of the injection and the other three drugs played the role of assistance. This study could not only provide the bioinformatics support in compatibility mechanism of Xingnaojing injection, but also provide theoretical support for its formula rationality.

29602854|t|Acupuncture for constipation in patients with stroke: protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis.
29602854|a|INTRODUCTION: Constipation is one of the most common complications in patients with stroke. Acupuncture has gained increased popularity for the management of constipation. However, there is a lack of supportive evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture for poststroke constipation. This systematic review aims to collect and critically appraise all the available evidence about the efficacy and safety of the acupuncture for constipation in poststroke patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive search of Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, four Chinese databases (National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literatures database (CBM), Wanfang Digital Periodicals (WANFANG) and Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals (VIP) database), one Japanese medical database (National Institute of Informatics, CiNii) and one Korean medical database (Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System, OASIS) will be conducted to identify randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for constipation in poststroke patients. There is no restriction on language or publication status. The primary outcome measure will be frequency of bowel movement. The risk of bias will be assessed using the approach recommended by Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We will conduct the meta-analysis to synthesise the evidence for each outcome, if possible. The heterogeneity will be statistically assessed using a χ2 test and I2 statistic. This protocol is developed following the guideline of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols 2015. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The ethical approval is not required because no primary data are collected. The findings will be presented at scientific conferences or a peer-reviewed scientific journal. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017076880.

29602836|t|Distribution and predictors of hospital charges for haemorrhagic stroke patients in Beijing, China, March 2012 to February 2015: a retrospective study.
29602836|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to analyse hospital charges for patients with haemorrhagic stroke in China and investigate potential factors associated with inpatient charges. METHODS: The study participants were in-hospital patients with a primary diagnosis of haemorrhagic stroke from all the secondary and tertiary hospitals in Beijing during the period from 1 March 2012 to 28 February 2015. Distribution characteristics of detailed hospital charges were analysed. The influence of potential factors on hospital charges was researched using a stepwise multiple regression model. RESULTS: A total of 34 890 patients with haemorrhagic stroke of mean age 61.19±14.37 years were included in the study, of which 37.2% were female. Median length of hospital stay (LOHS) was 15 days (IQR 9-23) and median hospital cost was 18 577 Chinese yuan (CNY) (IQR 10 442-39 784). The hospital costs for patients in Western medicine hospitals (median 19 651 CNY) were significantly higher (P<0.01) than those in traditional Chinese medicine hospitals (median 14 560 CNY), and were significantly higher (P<0.01) for Level 3 hospitals (median 20 029 CNY) than for Level 2 hospitals (median 16 095 CNY). The proportion of medicine fees and bed fees within total hospital charges showed a decreasing trend during the study period. With stepwise multiple regression, the major factors associated with hospital charges were LOHS, surgery, pulmonary infection, ventilator usage, hospital level, occupation, hyperlipidaemia, hospital type, in-hospital death, sex and age. CONCLUSION: We conclude that medicines form the largest part of hospital charges but are showing a decreasing trend, and LOHS is strongly associated with patient charges for haemorrhagic stroke in China. This implies that the cost structure is very unreasonable in China and medical technology costs fail to be fully manifested. A reasonable decrease in medicine charges and shortening LOHS may be effective ways to reduce hospital charges.

29607495|t|Acupuncture for acute stroke.
29607495|a|BACKGROUND: Sensory stimulation via acupuncture has been reported to alter activities of numerous neural systems by activating multiple efferent pathways. Acupuncture, one of the main physical therapies in Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been widely used to treat patients with stroke for over hundreds of years. This is the first update of the Cochrane Review originally published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether acupuncture could reduce the proportion of people with death or dependency, while improving quality of life, after acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched on February 2, 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Ovid (CENTRAL Ovid; 2017, Issue 2) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to February 2017), Embase Ovid (1974 to February 2017), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) EBSCO (1982 to February 2017), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED; 1985 to February 2017), China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database (1998 to February 2017), and the VIP database (VIP Chinese Science Journal Evaluation Reports; 1989 to February 2017). We also identified relevant trials in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (last searched on Feburuary 20, 2017), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (last searched on April 30, 2017), and Clinicaltrials.gov (last searched on April 30, 2017). In addition, we handsearched the reference lists of systematic reviews and relevant clinical trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of acupuncture started within 30 days from stroke onset compared with placebo or sham acupuncture or open control (no placebo) in people with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, or both. Needling into the skin was required for acupuncture. Comparisons were made versus (1) all controls (open control or sham acupuncture), and (2) sham acupuncture controls. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data independently. We contacted study authors to ask for missing data. We assessed the quality of the evidence by using the GRADE approach. We defined the primary outcome as death or dependency at the end of follow-up . MAIN RESULTS: We included in this updated review 33 RCTs with 3946 participants. Twenty new trials with 2780 participants had been completed since the previous review. Outcome data were available for up to 22 trials (2865 participants) that compared acupuncture with any control (open control or sham acupuncture) but for only six trials (668 participants) that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture control. We downgraded the evidence to low or very low quality because of risk of bias in included studies, inconsistency in the acupuncture intervention and outcome measures, and imprecision in effect estimates.When compared with any control (11 trials with 1582 participants), findings of lower odds of death or dependency at the end of follow-up and over the long term (≥ three months) in the acupuncture group were uncertain (odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46 to 0.79; very low-quality evidence; and OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85; eight trials with 1436 participants; very low-quality evidence, respectively) and were not confirmed by trials comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.18; low-quality evidence; and OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.12; low-quality evidence, respectively).In trials comparing acupuncture with any control, findings that acupuncture was associated with increases in the global neurological deficit score and in the motor function score were uncertain (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.84, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.32; 12 trials with 1086 participants; very low-quality evidence; and SMD 1.08, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71; 11 trials with 895 participants; very low-quality evidence). These findings were not confirmed in trials comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.57; low-quality evidence; and SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.17; low-quality evidence, respectively).Trials comparing acupuncture with any control have reported little or no difference in death or institutional care at the end of follow-up (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.12; five trials with 1120 participants; low-quality evidence), death within the first two weeks (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.55; 18 trials with 1612 participants; low-quality evidence), or death at the end of follow-up (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.58; 22 trials with 2865 participants; low-quality evidence).The incidence of adverse events (eg, pain, dizziness, faint) in the acupuncture arms of open and sham control trials was 6.2% (64/1037 participants), and 1.4% of these (14/1037 participants) discontinued acupuncture. When acupuncture was compared with sham acupuncture, findings for adverse events were uncertain (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.16; five trials with 576 participants; low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This updated review indicates that apparently improved outcomes with acupuncture in acute stroke are confounded by the risk of bias related to use of open controls. Adverse events related to acupuncture were reported to be minor and usually did not result in stopping treatment. Future studies are needed to confirm or refute any effects of acupuncture in acute stroke. Trials should clearly report the method of randomization, concealment of allocation, and whether blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors was achieved, while paying close attention to the effects of acupuncture on long-term functional outcomes.

29560637|t|[Regularity of Clinical Application of Lianquan (CV 23) in Chinese Ancient Times According to Literature of Traditional Chinese Medicine].
29560637|a|OBJECTIVE: To summarize the regularity of application of Lianquan (CV 23) in clinical practice in Chinese ancient times through analysis of ancient traditional Chinese medical (TCM) literature. METHODS: A total of 60 books involving CV 23 from the 1 156 ancient TCM books listed in the fifth edition of Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine were collected by using CV 23 as the main keyword and "Sheben" "Benchi", and "Jieben" (the other names of CV 23 in TCM)as the supplementary keywords and analyzed systematically. A database was then constructed from the collected data, including the related types of disorders or symptoms, acupoint recipes, and methods of needling and moxibustion, contraindications, etc. RESULTS: A total of 196 articles related to the application of CV 23 from 60 ancient classical books were collected in accordance with the inclusive criteria. Among them, 155 articles are referred to the indications of CV 23, 35 to types of disorders such as asthma, cough, tongue swelling with difficulty in speaking, protracted tongue, acute contraction of tongue root, vomiting, spasm syndrome, stroke, aphtha, problems of mouth and teeth, throat problems, etc. of the internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and five-sense organs; 64 items are referred to the application of single CV 23, 91 to CV 23-included recipes containing 111 adjunct acupoints, and 78 to stimulation of CV 23 with acupuncture needle, moxibustion, pricking blood, and fire needle. Moreover, of the 111 adjunct acupoints, the most commonly used are Shaoshang (LU 11), Tiantu (CV 22), Hegu (LI 4), Yuye (EX-HN 13), Zhongchong (PC 9), etc. CONCLUSION: Lianquan (CV 23) is mainly used for glossopharyngeal problems chiefly by syndrome-meridian differentiation. The supplement of complementary acupoints or five-shu points in combination with CV 23 has a synergistic effect. Moxibustion (3 moxa- cones in general) is often employed, and the needling depth is usually about 7.5 mm. The common contraindication of CV 23 is severe tongue swelling.

29765502|t|The Phenolic Components of Gastrodia elata improve Prognosis in Rats after Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion by Enhancing the Endogenous Antioxidant Mechanisms.
29765502|a|Pharmacological or spontaneous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke triggers an outbreak of reactive oxygen species and results in neuron death. Nrf2-mediated antioxidation in cells has been proved as a pivotal target for neuroprotection. This research reports that phenolic components of Gastrodia elata Blume (PCGE), a traditional Chinese medicine, can alleviate the pathological lesions in the penumbra and hippocampus by increasing the survival of neurons and astrocytes and improve neurofunction and cognition after reperfusion in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. LDH assay indicated that pretreatment of cells with PCGE (25 μg/ml) for 24 h significantly reduced H2O2-induced cell death in astrocytes and SH-SY5Y cells. Western blot showed that the nucleus accumulation of Nrf2 and the expression of cellular HO-1 and NQO-1, two of Nrf2 downstream proteins, were increased in both cells. BDNF, an Nrf2-dependent neurotrophic factor, was also upregulated by PCGE in astrocytes. These results illustrated that PCGE can reduce the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and improve prognosis by remedying the cell damage within affected tissues. The protective effects of PCGE seem to be via activation of a Nrf2-mediated cellular defense system. Therefore, PCGE could be a therapeutic candidate for ischemic stroke and other oxidative stress associated neurological disorders.

29317030|t|Combination of chemical fingerprinting with bioassay, a preferable approach for quality control of Safflower Injection.
29317030|a|Safflower Injection is one kind of injections derived from traditional Chinese medicine. It is widely applied to treat cerebrovascular diseases such as acute cerebral infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and angiitis. However, most adverse reactions of Safflower Injection in clinic are caused by its quality problems. In this study, 10 batches of normal and 42 batches of abnormal Safflower Injections were obtained from the clinical practice. Their quality fluctuations were detected by chemical fingerprinting (CF, ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry) and bioassays including cell-based biological profile (CBP) assay and enzymatic assay. CF identified 33 compounds in the Safflower Injections, and scutellarin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside were identified to be the possible components responsible for clinical adverse reaction. In addition, 59.5% (25/42), 85.7% (36/42) and 38.1% (16/42) of abnormal samples could be identified by CF, CBP assay and enzymatic assay, respectively. Interestingly, further integration of the three methods could entirely identify all the abnormal samples. It indicated that it is advisable to integrate CF, CBP assay and enzymatic assay for developing quality standard of Safflower Injections.

29540209|t|Celastrol treatment protects against acute ischemic stroke-induced brain injury by promoting an IL-33/ST2 axis-mediated microglia/macrophage M2 polarization.
29540209|a|BACKGROUND: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the most common type of cerebrovascular disease and is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Recently, a study suggested that transformation of microglia from the pro-inflammatory M1 state to the anti-inflammatory and tissue-reparative M2 phenotype may be an effective therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke. Celastrol, a traditional oriental medicine, may have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. METHODS: We first determined the expression levels of inflammatory factors in patients and rodent models associated with AIS; we then determined the anti-inflammatory effects of celastrol in AIS, both in vivo and in vitro, using animal models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and cell models of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment with or without celastrol, respectively. RESULTS: The results indicated that expression of both inflammatory (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) cytokines, as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-33, and IL-10, were increased following AIS in patients and in animal models. Furthermore, in vitro experiments confirmed that celastrol treatment decreased inflammatory cytokine expression induced by OGD through an IL-33/ST2 axis-mediated M2 microglia/macrophage polarization. Finally, celastrol is protected against ischemic-induced nerve injury, both in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that celastrol post-treatment reduces ischemic stroke-induced brain damage, suggesting celastrol may represent a novel potent pharmacological therapy.

29701038|t|[Dynamic scalp acupuncture combined with PNF therapy for upper limb motor impairment in ischemic stroke spastic hemiplegia].
29701038|a|OBJECTIVE: On the basic therapy, to assess the clinical effects of dynamic scalp acupuncture, scalp acupuncture combined with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) therapy and simple PNF therapy for upper limb motor impairment in ischemic post-stroke spastic hemiplegia. METHODS: A total of 90 cases were randomly assigned into a PNF group, a dynamic scalp acupuncture group and a scalp acupuncture group, 30 cases in each group. Basic therapy and PNF therapy were applied in the three groups. PNF therapy was used during scalp acupuncture in the dynamic scalp acupuncture group. PNF therapy was applied after scalp acupuncture in the scalp acupuncture group. The points were the upper 1/5 and middle 2/5 of Dingnieqianxiexian (MS 6) and Dingniehouxiexian (MS 7) at the lesion side, the hemiparalysis contralateral side. The treatment was given for 6 months, once a day and 1 month as a course. The modified Ashworth scale (MAS), the Fugl-Meyer motor assessment (FMA) and Barthel index (BI) were observed before treatment and 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: The MAS 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after treatment were improved compared with those before treatment in the three groups ( all P<0.05), and the MAS results in the dynamic scalp acupuncture group were better than those in the PNF and scalp acupuncture group (all P<0.05). The FMA and BI scores 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after treatment were higher than those before treatment (all P<0.05). The FMA Scores in the 3 time points and after treatment in the dynamic scalp acupuncture group were higher than those in the other two groups (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: PNF therapy during scalp acupuncture can relieve the spasmodic condition of patients with upper limb motor impairment in ischemic post-stroke spasmodic hemiplegia, and improve the limb function and life activity, which is better than PNF therapy after scalp acupuncture and simple PNF therapy.

30623065|t|Seasonal variation of stroke incidence in Wujin, a city in southeast China.
30623065|a|Objective: This study aimed to evaluate seasonal variations in stroke incidence in a city in southeast China. Methods: First-ever stroke in residents aged 20 or older in Wujin city was reported by local physicians between January 2006 and December 2007. All reported stroke cases were checked with the city-wide health insurance system. Fatal cases were checked with the household registry system. The annualized stroke incidences were calculated for each month and each season. The stroke incidence was compared among seasons, with spring as a reference. Results: Wujin city had an adult (≥20 y old) population of 1 278 020 in 2010. A total of 2319 stroke cases, 1217 male and 1102 female, were reported in 2006 and 2007. The raw annual incidence of stroke was 90.7/100 000 (95% CI: 82.1-94.5). Stroke incidence was highest in September (125.2/100 000; 95% CI = 109.4-139.3) and lowest in January (78.8/100 000; 95% CI = 69.1-93.2). Stroke incidence was highest in autumn (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.32, P < .001, compared with spring). Autumn also had the highest incidences of ischemic stroke (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.06-1.40). Conclusions: Stroke incidence showed monthly and seasonal variations in southeast China. Autumn had the highest incidences of both ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage.

29523170|t|Does feedback on daily activity level from a Smart watch during inpatient stroke rehabilitation increase physical activity levels? Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
29523170|a|BACKGROUND: Practicing activities improves recovery after stroke, but many people in hospital do little activity. Feedback on activity using an accelerometer is a potential method to increase activity in hospital inpatients. This study's goal is to investigate the effect of feedback, enabled by a Smart watch, on daily physical activity levels during inpatient stroke rehabilitation and the short-term effects on simple functional activities, primarily mobility. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial will be undertaken within the stroke rehabilitation wards of the Second Affiliated hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China. The study participants will be stroke survivors who meet inclusion criteria for the study, primarily: able to participate, no more than 4 months after stroke and walking independently before stroke. Participants will all receive standard local rehabilitation and will be randomly assigned either to receive regular feedback about activity levels, relative to a daily goal tailored by the smart watch over five time periods throughout a working day, or to no feedback, but still wearing the Smart watch. The intervention will last up to 3 weeks, ending sooner if discharged. The data to be collected in all participants include measures of daily activity (Smart watch measure); mobility (Rivermead Mobility Index and 10-metre walking time); independence in personal care (Barthel Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Index); overall activities (the World Health Organization (WHO) Disability Assessment Scale, 12-item version); and quality of life (the Euro-Qol 5L5D). Data will be collected by assessors blinded to allocation of the intervention at baseline, 3 weeks or at discharge (whichever is the sooner); and a reduced data set will be collected at 12 weeks by telephone interview. The primary outcome will be change in daily accelerometer activity scores. Secondary outcomes are compliance and adherence to wearing the watch, and changes in mobility, independence in personal care activities, and health-related quality of life. DISCUSSION: This project is being implemented in a large city hospital with limited resources and limited research experience. There has been a pilot feasibility study using the Smart watch, which highlighted some areas needing change and these are incorporated in this protocol.

Endovascular bridging therapies (EBT), including endovascular thrombectomy (ET) and intra-arterial thrombolytic (IAT), have been recommended to realize a favorable functional outcome for AIS patients. Methods: An overview of meta-analyses of primary randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies was performed evaluating EBT for AIS patients compared with usual care. Results: Ten meta-analyses were included in this overview. ET was associated with a higher incidence of achieving functional outcome improvement, defined as a modified Rankin scale of 0 to 1 (mRS, p = 0.003), 0 to 2 (p < 0.00001), and 0 to 3 (p = 0.005). The risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) rate and all-cause mortality were similar between the two groups. Moreover, IAT treatment was also related to significantly improved outcomes in terms of the mRS score (p < 0.05), but no significant difference in rates of sICH and mortality within 90 days. Conclusions: In conclusion, our analysis supports that EBT, regardless of format (e.g., ET or IAT), is superior to the best medical therapy alone (e.g., IVT) in terms of mRS score in patients with AIS. In addition, the safety of EBT is similar to IVT.

29510659|t|Next generation sequencing based pathogen analysis in a patient with neurocysticercosis: a case report.
29510659|a|BACKGROUND: Accurate and early diagnosis of neurocysticercosis (NCC) remains a challenge due to the heterogeneity of its clinical, immunological and imaging characteristics. The presence of cysticercus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of NCC patients has been previously detected via conventional PCR assays. To the best of our knowledge, the use of CSF Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) based pathogen analysis in patients with NCC infection has never been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: This study reports the clinical, imaging, and immunological features of a patient initially presenting with several months of headache who further developed a pure sensory stroke. NGS was used to detect the pathogen, and her CSF demonstrated the presence of Taenia solium-DNA. This finding was confirmed by a positive reaction to CSF cysticercosis antibodies. After antiparasitic treatment, secondary CSF NGS revealed the DNA index have dropped considerably compared to the initial NGS readings. CONCLUSIONS: NGS is a promising tool for the early and accurate diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) infection, especially in the setting of atypical clinical manifestations. Further studies are required to evaluate the persistence of DNA in the CSF of patients.

29511018|t|Treatment effects of systematic two-stent and provisional stenting techniques in patients with complex coronary bifurcation lesions: rationale and design of a prospective, randomised and multicentre DEFINITION II trial.
29511018|a|INTRODUCTION: Provisional stenting (PS) for simple coronary bifurcation lesions is the mainstay of treatment. A systematic two-stent approach is widely used for complex bifurcation lesions (CBLs). However, a randomised comparison of PS and two-stent techniques for CBLs has never been studied. Accordingly, the present study is designed to elucidate the benefits of two-stent treatment over PS in patients with CBLs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This DEFINITION II study is a prospective, multinational, randomised, endpoint-driven trial to compare the benefits of the two-stent technique with PS for CBLs. A total of 660 patients with CBLs will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion to receive either PS or the two-stent technique. The primary endpoint is the rate of 12-month target lesion failure defined as the composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (MI) and clinically driven target lesion revascularisation. The major secondary endpoints include all causes of death, MI, target vessel revascularisation, in-stent restenosis, stroke and each individual component of the primary endpoints. The safety endpoint is the occurrence of definite or probable stent thrombosis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol and informed consent have been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nanjing First Hospital, and accepted by each participating centre. Written informed consent was obtained from all enrolled patients. Findings of the study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated at conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02284750; Pre-results.

29483388|t|Tongxinluo Improves Apolipoprotein E-Deficient Mouse Heart Function.
29483388|a|Background: Our previous studies have shown that Tongxinluo (TXL), a compound Chinese medicine, can decrease myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, protect capillary endothelium function, and lessen cardiac ventricle reconstitution in animal models. The aim of this study was to illuminate whether TXL can improve hypercholesterolemia-impaired heart function by protecting artery endothelial function and increasing microvascular density (MVD) in heart. Furthermore, we will explore the underlying molecular mechanism of TXL cardiovascular protection. Methods: After intragastric administration of TXL (0.1 ml/10 g body weight) to C57BL/6J wild-type mice (n = 8) and ApoE-/- mice (n = 8), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood glucose levels in serum were measured. The parameters of heart rate (HR), left ventricular diastolic end diameter, and left ventricular systolic end diameter were harvested by ultrasonic cardiogram. The left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, cardiac output, and left ventricular fractional shortening were calculated. Meanwhile, aorta peak systolic flow velocity (PSV), end diastolic flow velocity, and mean flow velocity (MFV) were measured. The pulsatility index (PI) and resistant index were calculated in order to evaluate the vascular elasticity and resistance. The endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was evaluated by relaxation of aortic rings in response to acetylcholine. Western blotting and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed for protein and gene analyses of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Immunohistochemical detection was performed for myocardial CD34 expression. Data in this study were compared by one-way analysis of variance between groups. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Although there was no significant decrease of cholesterol level (F = 2.300, P = 0.240), TXL inhibited the level of triglyceride and VLDL (F = 9.209, P = 0.024 and F = 9.786, P = 0.020, respectively) in ApoE-/- mice. TXL improved heart function of ApoE-/- mice owing to the elevations of LVEF, SV, CO, and LVFS (all P < 0.05). TXL enhanced aortic PSV and MFV (F = 10.774, P = 0.024 and F = 11.354, P = 0.020, respectively) and reduced PI of ApoE-/- mice (1.41 ± 0.17 vs. 1.60 ± 0.17; P = 0.037). After incubation with 10 μmol/L acetylcholine, the ApoE-/- mice treated with TXL aortic segment relaxed by 44% ± 3%, significantly higher than control group mice (F = 9.280, P = 0.040). TXL also restrain the angiogenesis of ApoE-/- mice aorta (F = 21.223, P = 0.010). Compared with C57BL/6J mice, the MVD was decreased in heart tissue of untreated ApoE-/- mice (54.0 ± 3.0/mm2 vs. 75.0 ± 2.0/mm2; F = 16.054, P = 0.010). However, TXL could significantly enhance MVD (65.0 ± 5.0/mm2 vs. 54.0 ± 3.0/mm2; F = 11.929, P = 0.020) in treated ApoE-/- mice. In addition, TXL obviously increased the expression of VEGF protein determined by Western blot (F = 20.247, P = 0.004). Conclusions: TXL obviously improves the ApoE-/- mouse heart function from different pathways, including reduces blood fat to lessen atherosclerosis; enhances aortic impulsivity, blood supply capacity, and vessel elasticity; improves endothelium-dependent vasodilatation; restraines angiogenesis of aorta-contained plaque; and enhances MVD of heart. The molecular mechanism of MVD enhancement maybe relate with increased VEGF expression.

29498696|t|Synergistic Effects of Salvianolic Acid B and Puerarin on Cerebral Ischemia Reperfusion Injury.
29498696|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) is characterized by the sudden loss of blood circulation to an area of the brain, resulting in a corresponding loss of neurologic function. It has been a worldwide critical disease threatening to the health and life of human beings. Despite significant progresses achieved, effective treatment still remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the disease. Salvianolic acid B (Sal-B) and Puerarin (Pue) are two active neuroprotectants isolated from traditional Chinese herbs, Salvia miltiorrhiza and Kudzu root respectively, which have been used for the prevention and treatment of IS for thousands of years in China. The activities of two compounds against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury have been confirmed via various pathways. However, the therapeutic efficacy of any of the two components is still unsatisfied. In the present study, the effect of the combination of Sal-B and Pue on IS was evaluated and validated in vitro and in vivo. The ratio of two compounds was firstly optimized based on the results of CoCl₂ damaged PC12 cells model. The co-administration exhibited significantly protective effect in CoCl₂ induced PC12 cells injury model by reducing ROS, inhibiting apoptosis and improving mitochondrial membrane potential in vitro. Moreover, Sal-B + Pue significantly relieved neurological deficit scores and infarct area than Sal-B or Pue alone in vivo. The results indicated that neuroprotection mechanism of Sal-B + Pue was related to TLR4/MyD88 and SIRT1 activation signaling pathway to achieve synergistic effect, due to the inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6). In conclusion, the combination of Sal-B and Pue exerted much stronger neuroprotective effect than Sal-B or Pue alone, which provides a potential new drug and has great significance for the treatment of IS.

29499745|t|Efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture for post stroke depression: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
29499745|a|BACKGROUND: Poststroke depression is closely related to increased mortality in stroke patients. Compared with antidepressants, electroacupuncture (EA) treatment for poststroke depression (PSD) has relatively more stable effectiveness and can reduce side effects. This trial is designed to provide solid evidence for the efficacy and safety of EA treatment for patients with PSD. METHODS/DESIGN: This ongoing study is a single-blind, single-center, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. Sixty-two participants will be recruited from Shanghai Shuguang Hospital and randomized into either the EA group or the sham EA group. Baihui, Sishencong, Ganshu, Sanyinjiao, and Taichong are selected as the treatment acupoints in both groups. The EA group will receive the traditional EA treatment with de-qi sensation, and the sham EA group will receive sham EA treatment without needle penetration and electrostimulation. Participants will receive treatment 3 times per week for a total of 12 sessions over 4 weeks. The primary outcome is Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, and the secondary outcomes are scores on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living, and Depression Scale of traditional Chinese medicine. All of the outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks after EA treatment onset, 4 weeks after treatment onset, and at 8-week follow-up. Safety assessments will be done at each visit. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will demonstrate the efficacy and safety of EA treatment for PSD with credible and important clinical evidence, thus supporting EA treatment as an ideal choice for PSD treatment.

29291393|t|Patchouli alcohol protects against ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury via inhibiting neuroinflammation in normal and obese mice.
29291393|a|Almost all of the candidate drugs for ischemic stroke failed to be translated from bench to beside. One important reason is that animals used in experimental studies cannot mimic ischemic patients due to lack of comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Therefore, it is better to test candidate drugs not only in normal animals but also in animals with comorbidities. Patchouli alcohol (PA), a natural tricyclic sesquiterpene in the traditional Chinese herb Pogostemonisherba, is well recognized for its anti-inflammation function in various inflammatory diseases. And as inflammation plays a very important role in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury process and determines the ultimate brain damage, we hypothesized that PA could protect against cerebral I/R injury through its anti-inflammation ability. In this study, the effects of PA on cerebral I/R injury were evaluated in normal mice and obese mice. In normal mice with cerebral I/R injury, PA treatment reduced the infarct volume and neurological deficits in a dose- and time-dependent manner. PA treatment alleviated BBB dysfunction, inhibited mRNA and protein levels of TNF-α and IL-1β and modulated the activation of MAPKs signaling pathways. Moreover, PA also reduced infarct volume, alleviated the BBB dysfunction and inhibited inflammation in ob/ob mice with cerebral I/R injury. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that PA could protect against cerebral I/R injury not only in normal mice but also in obese mice via inhibiting inflammation, suggesting that PA can be a potential drug for clinical treatment of ischemic stroke.

29576055|t|Buyang Huanwu Decoction ameliorates ischemic stroke by modulating multiple targets with multiple components: In vitro evidences.
29576055|a|Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine prescription which is used to treat ischaemic stroke and stroke-induced disabilities. However, the exact mechanism underlying BYHWD's amelioration of ischaemic stroke and its effective constituents remain unclear. The present study aimed to identify the effective constituents of BYHWD and to further explore its action mechanisms in the amelioration of ischaemic stroke by testing the activities of 15 absorbable chemical constituents of BYHWD with the same methods under the same conditions. The following actions of these 15 compounds were revealed: 1) Ferulic acid, calycosin, formononetin, astrapterocarpan-3-O-β-D-glucoside, paeonol, calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside, astraisoflavan-7-O-β-D-glucoside, ligustrazine, and propyl gallate significantly suppressed concanavalin A (Con A)-induced T lymphocyte proliferation; 2) Propyl gallate, calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside, paeonol, and ferulic acid markedly inhibited LPS-induced apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells; 3) Propyl gallate and formononetin significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO release; 4) Hydroxysafflor yellow A and inosine protected PC12 cells against the injuries caused by glutamate; and 5) Formononetin, astragaloside IV, astraisoflavan-7-O-β-D-glucoside, inosine, paeoniflorin, ononin, paeonol, propyl gallate, ligustrazine, and ferulic acid significantly suppressed the constriction of the thoracic aorta induced by KCl in rats. In conclusion, the results from the present study suggest that BYHWD exerts its ischaemic stroke ameliorating activities by modulating multiple targets with multiple components.

29373162|t|Altered functional connectivity in post-ischemic stroke depression: A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
29373162|a|OBJECTIVE: In previous studies, post-stroke depression (PSD) was found to be related to stroke characteristics as well as social and psychological factors. This study identified altered functional connectivity (FC) in patients with PSD at the subacute phase in three brain networks: default mood network (DMN), cognitive control network (CCN), and affective network (AN). The correlation between FC and the severity of PSD was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance image (rs-fMRI) was performed on 26 PSD patients (6 females), 24 stroke patients without depression (5 females), and 24 age-matched normal controls (6 females) all aged 40-75 years. The FC values of DMN, CCN, and AN were calculated and compared among the three groups. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (17 items) was employed and the score was correlated with FC in the PSD group. RESULTS: The FCs of the three networks were altered in PSD patients at the subacute phase compared to stroke patients without depression and normal controls (NC). Moreover, the left inferior parietal gyrus, the left orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus, and left angular gyrus (which indicated altered FC) were significantly correlated with HDRS scores in PSD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Alteration of the three neural networks might be correlated with the development of PSD at the subacute phase of stroke.

29183105|t|Relation of Carotid Artery Plaque to Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke in Chinese Patients: Does Hyperglycemia Status Matter?
29183105|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of carotid artery plaque with the incident coronary heart disease and stroke events in Chinese patients and explore whether the association differs between patients with and without hyperglycemia. METHODS: We evaluated plaque, and blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting serum insulin, fasting plasma glucose, 2 h postprandial glucose and Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in 253 Chinese patients. T-test and X2 test were used to compare the clinical characteristics and Binary logistic regression was applied to analyze the association of coronary heart disease and stroke between patients with and without hyperglycemia. RESULTS: Among 253 patients, 162 patients had hyperglycemia (i. e., diabetes, impaired glucose regulation and stress induced hyperglycemia) and 155 (61.3%) patients had plaque. Fasting plasma glucose, 2 h postprandial glucose and Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides, plaque were significantly higher in the hyperglycemia group than non-hyperglycemia. The incident coronary heart disease and stroke events in patients with plaque were 2.254 (95%CI,1.203-4.224) and 2.437 (95%CI,1.042-5.701) times higher than those without plaque, respectively. Among hyperglycemia subgroup, plaque was an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (OR,3.075,95%CI,1.353-6.992) and stroke (OR,3.571,95%CI,1.460-8.737). The slopes (associations between coronary heart disease/stroke and plaque) were steeper in the hyperglycemia group than those in the non-hyperglycemia group (coronary heart disease OR,3.075 vs. 2.614; stroke OR,3.571 vs. 3.307). CONCLUSIONS: The incident coronary heart disease and stroke events in patients with plaque were higher than those without plaque, and this difference was more pronounced for patients with hyperglycemia vs. those without hyperglycemia.

29198014|t|Inhibition of Complement Drives Increase in Early Growth Response Proteins and Neuroprotection Mediated by Salidroside After Cerebral Ischemia.
29198014|a|Salidroside is neuroprotective across a wide therapeutic time-window after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Here, we investigated the role of complement in mediating effects of salidroside after cerebral IRI in rats. Rats were administrated with vehicle or salidroside 50 mg/kg, given daily for either 24 or 48 h, after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h and reperfusion for 1 h. Levels of proteins in ischemic brain were measured by immunofluorescence and western blotting. We observed early increases in the deposition of immunoglobulin M, mannose-binding lectin 2, and annexin IV on cerebral endothelial cells, induction of the complement components C3 and C3a, by 24 h after IRI, and a later significant increase in the complement component C1q by 48 h. Salidroside prevented these changes. The neuroplasticity-related early growth response proteins Egr1, Egr2, and Egr4 and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein increased transiently in the first 6 h after IRI but then decreased below baseline by 48 h after IRI. Neither salidroside nor a C3a receptor antagonist (C3aRA) affected these proteins 24 h after IRI, but both reversed their later decreases to similar and non-additive extents. Salidroside and C3aRA increased NeuN in a non-additive manner after IRI. Our results suggest that salidroside exerts neuroprotection by reducing early activation of the lectin pathway on the cerebral endothelium and inhibiting the gradual activation of the classical pathway after cerebral IRI. This prolonged neuroprotection may depend, at least in part, on increased expression of neuroplasticity-related genes driven by reduced complement activation.

29511499|t|MiR-103 regulates the angiogenesis of ischemic stroke rats by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
29511499|a|Objectives: To investigate the effect of miR-103 on the angiogenesis of ischemic stroke rats via targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at the molecular level. Materials and Methods: Rat models had received the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham operation before grouping, and cell models of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) were performed. FITC-dextran, matrigel, and Trans-well assays were used to evaluate the vascular density, tube formation, and cell migration respectively. The expression levels of miR-103 and VEGF were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Dual-luciferase assay was used for analyzing the targeting relationship between miR-103 and VEGF. Results: We found the reduced miR-103 in rats after MCAO. Down-regulating miR-103 with the miR-103 inhibitor enhanced VEGF, ameliorated the neurological scores, decreased infarct volume, and increased vascular density in rats after MCAO. Besides, in OGD human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), inhibition of miR-103 could promote the increase of tube length and the migration of cells. Additionally, we found that miR-103 could directly target VEGF and thereby lead to the down-expression of VEGF. Meanwhile, si-VEGF could reverse the effect of miR-103 inhibitor on angiogenesis in rats subjected to MCAO. Conclusion: Inhibition of miR-103 could promote ischemic stroke angiogenesis and reduce infarction volume via enhancing VEGF, which provides a new target for the clinical treatment of ischemic stroke.

29685000|t|Thymoquinone protects against cerebral small vessel disease: Role of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.
29685000|a|Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a leading cause of progressive decline of cognition and a major risk factor for stroke. Thymoquinone (TQ) is the major biological component of Nigella sativa (N. sativa) and its extracts. We explored the possible protective effect of TQ against CSVD in strokeprone spontaneously hypertensive SHRsp rats. Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests were conducted to evaluate memory and cognitive function. mRNA expression of inflammatory factors were determined and oxidative stress was evaluated. We showed that TQ markedly decreased the level of systolic blood pressure in SHRsp rats. TQ reduced the escape latency time and the time spent in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze test in SHRsp rats. TQ also decreased the time spent with the novel object in SHRsp rats in both short- and long-term memory tests. TQ markedly increased the capacity to distinguish between familiar objects and novel objects in the SHRsp rats in the short- and long-term memory tests. The mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 in the brain of SHRsp rats was remarkably decreased by TQ, indicating the reduction of inflammation. Moreover, TQ increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, decreased the malondialdehyde level and increased glutathione level in the brain of SHRsp rats, indicating the attenuation of oxidative stress. In summary, we found that TQ could effectively attenuate the blood pressure and the injury of memory and cognition under the condition of CSVD. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of TQ may be responsible for its protective effect. We demonstrate that TQ is a novel candidate for the treatment of CSVD and its neurological outcome.

28771753|t|Sleep apnea and risk of vertigo: A nationwide population-based cohort study.
28771753|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of vertigo in patients with sleep apnea. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: This study used data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, a population-based database. A total of 5,025 patients who were newly diagnosed with sleep apnea between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2012, were identified from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000, a nationally representative database of 1 million randomly selected patients. Moreover, 20,100 patients without sleep apnea were matched at a 1:4 ratio by age, sex, socioeconomic status, and urbanization level. Patients were followed up until death or the end of the study period (December 31, 2013). The primary outcome was the occurrence of vertigo. RESULTS: Patients with sleep apnea had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of vertigo than those without sleep apnea (P < 0.001). The adjusted Cox proportional hazard model showed that sleep apnea was significantly associated with a higher incidence of vertigo (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-1.97; P < 0.001). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to adjust for confounders, including head trauma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, and obesity. Sleep apnea was demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for vertigo. CONCLUSION: This is the first nationwide population-based cohort study to investigate the association between sleep apnea and vertigo. The findings strongly support that sleep apnea is an independent risk factor for vertigo. Based on the study results, physicians should be aware of potential vertigo occurrence following sleep apnea. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4. Laryngoscope, 128:763-768, 2017.

29517685|t|The altered Granger causality connection among pain-related brain networks in migraine.
29517685|a|Numerous fMRI studies have confirmed functional abnormalities in resting-state brain networks in migraine patients. However, few studies focusing on causal relationships of pain-related brain networks in migraine have been conducted. This study aims to explore the difference of Granger causality connection among pain-related brain networks in migraine without aura (MWoA) patients.Twenty two MWoA patients and 17 matched healthy subjects were recruited to undergo resting-state fMRI scanning. Independent component analysis was used to extract pain-related brain networks, and Granger causality analysis to characterize the difference of Granger causality connection among pain-related brain networks was employed.Seven pain-related brain networks were identified, and MwoA patients showed more complex Granger causality connections in comparison with healthy subjects. Two-sample t test results displayed that there was the significant difference between right-frontoparietal network (RFPN) and executive control network (ECN).This study indicates that the specific intrinsic brain Granger causality connectivity among pain-related networks in MwoA patients are affected after long-term migraine attacks.

29407575|t|Anti-inflammatory effects of anisalcohol on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 microglia via selective modulation of microglia polarization and down-regulation of NF-κB p65 and JNK activation.
29407575|a|Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. The inhibition of inflammation appears to be a potential therapeutic strategy for neuro-inflammatory injury after ischemic stroke. In response to cerebral ischemia, resident microglia and infiltrated macrophages from the damaged blood-brain barrier are activated. Microglia activation appears to be a double-edged sword. Activated microglia migrate to the damaged neuron, change their phenotype to M1 or M2, and become involved in nerve damage and repair. M1 phenotype microglia express multiple inflammatory factors to exacerbate secondary brain injury, while those of M2 phenotype release anti-inflammatory factors to promote brain recovery after ischemic stroke. Therefore, the regulation of microglia M1/M2 phenotype after ischemic stroke is crucial for brain repair. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of anisalcohol (p-methoxybenzyl alcohol, PMBA), a phenolic compound from Gastrodia elata Blume, which has been shown to reduce cerebral ischemic injury in rodents. However, no studies have specifically addressed whether PMBA can selectively modulate microglia polarization. In this study, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 microglia were used to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of PMBA. The results revealed that PMBA significantly reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of tumour necrosis factor α, prostaglandin E2, and nitric oxide, without causing cell toxicity. In addition, it increased anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β. Phenotypic analysis of LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia showed that PMBA significantly down-regulated the expression of the M1 marker CD16/32 and up-regulated that of the M2 marker CD206. Moreover, PMBA suppressed NF-κB activation and inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. Collectively, our data demonstrate that PMBA can inhibit M1 transformation and promote M2 transformation of microglia, thus attenuating the production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The modulation of microglia M1/M2 polarization may involve multiple mechanisms, mainly, the inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK activation. These findings suggest that PMBA acts as an anti-inflammatory factor and is a possible therapeutic candidate for diseases such as ischemic stroke, where inflammation is a central hallmark.

29623912|t|Cerebral ischemia and neuroregeneration.
29623912|a|Cerebral ischemia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although stroke (a form of cerebral ischemia)-related costs are expected to reach 240.67 billion dollars by 2030, options for treatment against cerebral ischemia/stroke are limited. All therapies except anti-thrombolytics (i.e., tissue plasminogen activator) and hypothermia have failed to reduce neuronal injury, neurological deficits, and mortality rates following cerebral ischemia, which suggests that development of novel therapies against stroke/cerebral ischemia are urgently needed. Here, we discuss the possible mechanism(s) underlying cerebral ischemia-induced brain injury, as well as current and future novel therapies (i.e., growth factors, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, melatonin, resveratrol, protein kinase C isozymes, pifithrin, hypothermia, fatty acids, sympathoplegic drugs, and stem cells) as it relates to cerebral ischemia.

29317279|t|Research progress in stroke-induced immunodepression syndrome (SIDS) and stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP).
29317279|a|In recent years, stroke-induced immunodepression syndrome (SIDS) and the resulting stroke-associated infection (SAI) have become a focus of current research efforts. Inflammatory reactions after stroke promote tissue healing and eliminate necrotic cells, whereas excessive inflammatory reactions may cause secondary damage. Stroke-induced immunodepression not only reduces inflammatory reactions and protects brain tissues but also weakens the resistance of the human body against pathogens and leads to infection. Changes in the local and systemic immune system in stroke patients may play an important role in prognosis. Infection is a leading cause of death in patients following stroke, and an evaluation of the prognosis of stroke patients is associated closely with the presence of infectious complications. Among these complications, pneumonia is the most common type of infection observed after acute stroke, which exhibits the greatest effect on the recovery of neurological function. SIDS is closely related to stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP), and the use of immunodepression as an entry point may provide an efficacious treatment target and drug development strategy. An improved understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to SAP is essential to develop new treatment strategies for improving the outcomes of stroke patients.

28421375|t|Obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk of cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.
28421375|a|PURPOSE: Recent studies have shown an association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and coronary artery disease; however, the association between OSA and cardiac outcomes in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains undetermined. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to July 2016 for cohort studies that followed up with patients after PCI, and evaluated their overnight sleep patterns within 1 month for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) as primary outcomes including cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary revascularization and secondary outcomes including re-admission for heart failure and stroke. Outcomes data were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I 2 statistics. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale checklist, and publication bias was evaluated by a visual investigation of funnel plots. RESULTS: We identified seven pertinent studies including 2465 patients from 178 related articles. OSA was associated with MACEs (odds ratio [OR], 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.93, I 2 = 29%), which included cardiac death (OR 2.05, 95% CI, 1.15-3.65, I 2 = 0%), non-fatal MI (OR 1.59, 95% CI, 1.14-2.23, I 2 = 15%), and coronary revascularization (OR 1.69, 95% CI, 1.28-2.23, I 2 = 0%). However, OSA was not associated with re-admission for heart failure (OR 1.71, 95% CI, 0.99-2.96, I 2 = 0%) and/or stroke (OR 1.68, 95% CI, 0.91-3.11, I 2 = 0%) according to the pooled results. CONCLUSIONS: In patients after PCI, OSA appears to increase the risk of cardiac death, non-fatal MI, and coronary revascularization.

29454341|t|Treatment of depression with Chai Hu Shu Gan San: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 randomized controlled trials.
29454341|a|BACKGROUND: Depression is a common mental disorder. Chai Hu Shu Gan San, a traditional Chinese medicine, is used to treat depression empirically. We present a systematic review and meta-analysis of the therapeutic efficacy and safety of Chai Hu Shu Gan San in treating depression. METHODS: Several databases, including PubMed, China National Knowledge Internet, Wanfang, Chongqing VIP, and the Cochrane library, were systematically searched from their date of foundation to January 1, 2017. In this review, wehave included randomized control trials that compared Chai Hu Shu Gan San (or its combination with a regular Western medicine) with a regular Western medicine alone for the treatment of depression. Two investigators independently extracted and analyzed the data using RevMan 5.2.0 software. Mean difference (with a 95% confidence interval) was used as efficacy indices for outcomes. RESULTS: We included 42 studies involving 3234 patients with depression in 15 different types of diseases. Meta analyses showed better effect of Chai Hu Shu Gan San than fluoxetine for pure depression (MD = - 1.59, from - 2.82 to - 0.37, 4 trials, I2 = 26%), for post-stroke depression (MD = - 4.20, from - 6.20 to - 2.19, 7 trials, I2 = 96%), and for postpartum depression (MD = - 4.10, from - 7.48 to - 0.72 7 trials, I2 = 86%). None of the articles reported severe adverse events of oral administration of Chai Hu Shu Gan San. Furthermore, any adverse effects of using Chai Hu Shu Gan San alone were fewer than those of regular Western medicines. CONCLUSIONS: This review found that Chai Hu Shu Gan San has some advantages in treating depression, especially post-stroke depression and post-partum depression. A meticulously designed and conducted randomized control trial is needed for further evaluation.

29258757|t|Involvement of brain-gut axis in treatment of cerebral infarction by β-asaron and paeonol.
29258757|a|Cerebral infarction (CI) causes severe brain damage with high incidence. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of brain-gut axis in the treatment of CI by combined administration of β-asaron and paeonol. Rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established, the interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the rat peripheral blood were determined by ELISA assay, and brain tissue damage was evaluated by TUNNEL assay. The correlation of cholecystokinin (CCK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling components between intestinal mucosa and prefrontal cortex of MCAO rats treated with β-asaron and paeonol were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. In vitro transwell co-culture was performed to confirm the correlated expression. The expression of CCK and NF-κB signaling components were closely correlated between the intestinal mucosa and prefrontal cortex of MCAO rats treated with β-asaron and paeonol. The combined administration also regulates the IL-1β and TNF-α in the MCAO rat peripheral blood and ameliorate the brain damage in MCAO rats. Elevated expression of related genes was observed in the cortical neurons co-cultured with intestinal mucosal epithelial cells treated by β-asaron and paeonol. The brain-gut axis mediates the therapeutic effect of β-asaron and paeonol for cerebral infarction through CCK and NF-κB signaling.

29353037|t|Curcumin protects cortical neurons against oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation injury through flotillin-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 pathway.
29353037|a|In this study, we provided evidence that curcumin could be a promising therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke by activating neuroprotective signaling pathways. Post oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R), primary mouse cortical neurons treated with curcumin exhibited a significant decrease in cell death, LDH release and enzyme caspase-3 activity under OGD/R circumstances, which were abolished by flotillin-1 downregulation or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor. Moreover, flotillin-1 knockdown led to suppression of curcumin-mediated ERK phosphorylation under OGD/R condition. Based on these findings, we concluded that curcumin could confer neuroprotection against OGD/R injury through a novel flotillin-1 and ERK1/2 pathway.

29254760|t|A Posterior Circulation Ischemia Risk Score System to Assist the Diagnosis of Dizziness.
29254760|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to establish a risk score system without radio-image examination, which could help clinicians to differentiate patients with vertigo and posterior circulation ischemia (PCI) rapidly from the other dizzy patients. METHODS: We analyzed 304 patients with vertigo (50% PCI). The attributes with more significant contributions were selected as the risk factors for the PCI risk score system, and every one of them was assigned a value according to their respective odds ratio values. We also compared the respective receiver operating characteristic curves of the 3 diagnostic methods (PCI score system, ABCD2, and Essen score systems) to evaluate their prediction effectiveness. RESULTS: Nine risk factors were ultimately selected for PCI score system, including high blood pressure (1'), diabetes mellitus (1'), ischemic stroke (1'), rotating and rocking (-1'), difficulty in speech (5'), tinnitus (-5'), limb and sensory deficit (5'), gait ataxia (1'), and limb ataxia (5'). According to their respective PCI risk scores, the patients were divided into 3 subgroups: low risk (≤0', risk <37.4%), medium risk (1'-5'), and high risk (≥6', risk >95.0%). When 0' was selected as a cutoff point for differentiating the patients with PCI from patients without PCI, the sensitivity was 94.1%, with a specificity of 41.4%. The areas under the receiver operator curve value of PCI score system was .82 (P = .000), much higher than the areas under the receiver operator curve value of ABCD2 (.69, P = .000) and that of the Essen system (.67, P = .000) CONCLUSION: The PCI score system could help clinicians to differentiate patients with vertigo and PCI rapidly from the other dizzy patients.

29111341|t|Low-Dose Tissue Plasminogen Activator in Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
29111341|a|BACKGROUND: Intravenous thrombolysis using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) improves significantly the neurologic function in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, it brings financial burden to patients and is associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH). Whether low-dose tPA can effectively reduce SICH and has the same efficacy as standard-dose tPA is still controversial. METHODS: We searched for English clinical trials published before March, 2017on the comparison of the efficacy and safety between low and standard dose of tPA in the treatment of AIS using MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) score was used as the primary efficacy outcome. The mRS1 corresponded to 0-1, whereas mRS2 corresponded to 0-2. The SICH and mortality were adopted as primary safety outcomes. RESULTS: Twelve high-quality studies were selected, including 7686 patients (low-dose: 2888, standard-dose: 4798). With no statistical heterogeneity, the fixed effects model was adopted in the analysis. Similarly to standard doses, low-dose tPA improved the mRS scores (mRS1: odds ratio [OR] = .92, 95% confidence interval [CI] .84-1.02; P = .12; mRS2: OR = .97, 95% CI .88-1.08; P = .57). Compared with standard-dose tPA, low-dose tPA reduced the incidence of SICH (by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS] definition: OR = .71, 95% CI .57-0.89; P = .003; by Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke Monitoring Study [SITS-MOST] definition: OR = .64, 95% CI .42-0.99; P = .04), while both reduced mortality (OR = .87, 95% CI .74-1.02; P = .08). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose tPA is comparable to standard-dose tPA in improving the neurologic function and reducing mortality in AIS patients. Moreover, low-dose tPA can reduce the incidence of SICH compared with standard-dose tPA. Therefore, low-dose tPA is highly recommended in AIS patients.

29017932|t|Tanshinone I prevents atorvastatin-induced cerebral hemorrhage in zebrafish and stabilizes endothelial cell-cell adhesion by inhibiting VE-cadherin internalization and actin-myosin contractility.
29017932|a|Defects in vascular integrity in cerebrovasculature lead to serious pathologies including hemorrhagic stroke. The stability of cell adhesion junctions and actin-myosin contractile machinery are two major determinants for the integrity of endothelial monolayer. Here we have evaluated the protective effects of tanshinone I (Tan I), a lipophilic compound presents in Salvia miltiorrhiza, against atorvastatin-induced cerebral hemorrhage in zebrafish in vivo, and further dissected the molecular mechanisms in HUVECs. We demonstrated that Tan I protected endothelial integrity by stabilizing cell-cell adhesion junctions via the inhibition of Src-mediated VE-cadherin internalization and subsequent junction-linked actin cytoskeleton depolymerization. In addition, Tan I inhibited ROCK-associated endothelial contractile machinery by dephosphorylating cofilin and MYPT1. These findings identified Tan I as an endothelial stabilizing agent and suggested Tan I as a potential treatment for vascular leakage in hemorrhagic stroke.

29294303|t|Astragaloside IV protects blood-brain barrier integrity from LPS-induced disruption via activating Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway in mice.
29294303|a|Endothelial cells of cerebral microvessels are one of the components of blood-brain-barrier (BBB), which are connected by tight junctions (TJs). BBB disruption in cerebral diseases such as ischemic stroke, Alzhemer's disease, multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury is implicated to exacerbate the disease progression. Astragaloside IV (ASIV) isolated from Astragalus membranaceus prevents BBB breakdown in rodents induced with cerebral edema and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. However, its underlying molecular mechanism has not been elucidated yet. In present study, ASIV was found to prevent the leakage of BBB in LPS-induced mice, which was accompanied with increased zo-1 and occludin but reduced VCAM-1 in brain microvessels. Similarly, in brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 cells, ASIV mitigated the increased permeability induced by LPS, as evidenced by increased TEER and reduced sodium fluorescein extravasation. ASIV also enhanced the expression of TJ proteins such as zo-1, occludin and claudin-5 in LPS stimulated bEnd.3 cells. Meanwhile, it inhibited the inflammatory responses and prevented the monocyte adhesion onto bEnd.3 cells upon LPS stimulation. Further study disclosed that ASIV could alleviate ROS level and activate Nrf2 antioxidant pathway in bEnd.3 cells. When Nrf2 was silenced, the protective effect of ASIV was abolished. In brain microvessels of LPS-induced mice, ASIV also enhanced the expression of Nrf2 antioxidant pathway related proteins. Collectively, our results demonstrated that ASIV protected the integrity of BBB in LPS-induced mice, the mechanism of which might be mediated via activating Nrf2 signaling pathway. The findings suggested that ASIV might be a potential neuroprotective drug acting on BBB.

29600656|t|[Characterization and pathophysiological changes of cerebral infarction rat model with qi-deficiency and blood-stasis Syndrome].
29600656|a|This study aimed to observe the general state and changes in pathophysiological indexes of multiple cerebral infarction rat model with Qi-deficienty and Blood-stasis syndrome. Rats were randomly divided into 4 groups(with 30 in each group): the normal group, the sham group, the model group and the Yiqi Huoxue recipe group. Rats in the model group and Yiqi Huoxue group were provided with interruptable sleep deprivation for 7 days before the multiple cerebral infarction operation, and followed by another 4 weeks of sleep deprivation; rats in the Yiqi Huoxue group were intragastrically administrated with drug at a dose of 26 g·kg⁻¹, once a day for 4 weeks. The general state was observed, and the pathophysiological indexes were measured at 48 h, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after administration. The results showed that rats in the normal group and the sham group represented a good general state and behaviors, with a normal morphological structure of brain tissues; rats in the model group featured yellow fur, depression, accidie, loose stools and movement disorder, with obvious brain histomorphological damage, which became aggravated with the increase of modeling time; rats in the Yiqi Huoxue group showed release in the general state and above indexes. Compared with the sham group at three time points, rats in the model group showed decrease in body weight, exhaustive swimming time and RGB value of tongue surface image, and increase in whole blood viscosity of the shear rate under 5, 60 and 150 S⁻¹, reduction in cerebral cortex Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase, Ca²⁺-ATPase activity and contents of 5-HT, rise in TXB2 levels and decline in 6-keto-PGF1a in serum(P<0.05, P<0.01). Compared with the model group, rats in the Yiqi Huoxue group showed alleviations in the above indexes at 2 w and 4 w(P<0.05, P<0.01). The results showed that the characterization and pathophysiological indexes in the multiple cerebral infarction rat model with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome were deteriorated; Yiqi Huoxue recipe could significantly alliviate the abnormal conditions, which suggested of the model was stable and reliable and the pathophysiologic evolutionary mechanism might be related to energy metabolism dysfunction, vasoactive substance abnormality and changes in neurotransmitters.

29600631|t|[Exploring Chinese medicine and Western medicine group modules in acute phase of ischemic stroke disease].
29600631|a|Under the theoretical guidance of "combination of disease and syndrome， correspondence between syndrome and prescription， and dynamic space-time"， 11 135 acute ischemic stroke patients were collected from hospital information system(HIS) of many 3A grade hospitals of traditional Chinese medicine. Complex network analysis was adopted to obtain the core syndrome elements in different periods of acute ischemic stroke patients， and it was found that the core syndrome elements were blood stasis syndrome， phlegm， endogenous wind， Yin deficiency， Qi deficiency， heat， hyperactivity of liver Yang， liver， and kidney of patients in hospital for the first day， and during 8-14 d in hospitalization， the core syndrome elements were blood stasis， phlegm， Yin deficiency， Qi deficiency， endogenous wind， hyperactivity of liver Yang， liver， and kidney. The data with "improved" and "cured" treatment outcomes were adopted for complex network analysis and correlation analysis to identify the Chinese and Western medicine group modules in patients with different disease conditions in different phases after hospitalization. It was found that the Chinese and Western medicine modules within 14 d after hospitalization mainly included "blood-activating and stasis-dissolving module "consisted by "anti-platelet drug + circulation-improving medicine(or anticoagulant drug and anti-fibrinogen drug， et al) + blood-activating and stasis-dissolving drugs"， as well as "stasis-dissolving and phlegm-reducing module" consisted by "anti-platelet drugs + circulation-improving medicine(or anticoagulant drug and anti-fibrinogen drug， et al) + phlegm refreshing drug". The core Chinese and Western medicine modules in patients with urgent and general conditions within 7 d after hospitalization mainly used "blood-activating and stasis-dissolving module" and "stasis-dissolving and phlegm-reducing module". Three or more Chinese medicine and Western medicines module with more than 1% utilization rate was not found in the patients with critical disease condition in admission. The urgent， general and critically ill patients in admission mainly used "blood-activating and stasis-dissolving module" in 8-14 d. From the real world medical big data research， it was found that the combined use of Chinese and Western medicines were consistent with "combination of disease and syndrome， correspondence between syndrome and prescription， and dynamic space-time" theory， and multiple multidimensional dynamic Chinese medicine and Western medicine group modules of "patient-syndrome-drug-time-effective" at the acute ischemic stroke stage were dug out， forming the method of Chinese and Western medicine combination research based on electrical medical big data.

29445354|t|Effects of Acupuncture on the Recovery Outcomes of Stroke Survivors with Shoulder Pain: A Systematic Review.
29445354|a|Background: Poststroke shoulder pain limits stroke survivors' physical functioning, impairs their ability to perform daily activities, and compromises their quality of life. The use of acupuncture to manage shoulder pain after a stroke is believed to free the blockage of energy flow and produce analgesic effects, but the evidence is unclear. We therefore conducted a systematic review to summarize the current evidence on the effects of acupuncture on the recovery outcomes of stroke survivors with shoulder pain. Methods: Fourteen English and Chinese databases were searched for data from January 2009 to August 2017. The review included adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke who had developed shoulder pain and had undergone conventional acupuncture, electroacupuncture, fire needle acupuncture, or warm needle acupuncture. The participants in the comparison group received the usual stroke care only. Results: Twenty-nine randomized controlled trials were included. Most studies were assessed as having a substantial risk of bias. Moreover, due to the high heterogeneity of the acupuncture therapies examined, pooling the results in a meta-analysis was not appropriate. A narrative summary of the results is thus presented. The review showed that conventional acupuncture can be associated with benefits in reducing pain and edema and improving upper extremity function and physical function. The effects of conventional acupuncture on improving shoulder range of motion (ROM) are in doubt because this outcome was only examined in two trials. Electroacupuncture might be effective in reducing shoulder pain and improving upper extremity function, and conclusions on the effects of electroacupuncture on edema, shoulder ROM, and physical function cannot be drawn due to the limited number of eligible trials. The evidence to support the use of fire needle or warm needle acupuncture in stroke survivors with shoulder pain is also inconclusive due to the limited number of studies. Conclusion: Although most studies reviewed concluded that conventional and electroacupuncture could be effective for management of shoulder pain after stroke, the very high potential for bias should be considered. Further work in this area is needed that employs standardized acupuncture treatment modalities, endpoint assessments, and blinding of treatments.

28986333|t|Protective effect of Danhong Injection combined with Naoxintong Capsule on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.
28986333|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Danhong Injection (DHI) and Naoxintong Capsule (NXT) are renowned traditional Chinese medicine in China. The drug combination of DHI and NXT is frequently applied for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in clinic. However, there had been no pharmacological experiment studies of interaction between DHI and NXT. Due to the drug interactions, exploring their interaction profile is of great importance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, focal cerebral I/R injury in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 1h followed by reperfusion. Rats were divided into 5 groups: sham group, ischemia reperfusion untreated group (IRU), DHI group (DHI 10mL/kg/d), NXT group (NXT 0.5g/kg/d), DHI plus NXT group (DHI-NXT, DHI 10mL/kg/d plus NXT 0.5g/kg/d). All drug-treated groups were respectively successive administrated for 7 days after ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury. The effects on rat neurological function were estimated by neurological defect scores. Brain infarct volumes were determined based on 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Pathological changes in brain tissues were observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Levels of nitric oxide (NO), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in serum were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohisto-chemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expressions of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), von Willebrand factor-microvessel vascular density (vWF-MVD), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), angiogenin-1 (Ang-1), angiogenin-2 (Ang-2) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) at day 7 after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. RESULTS: Compared with IRU group and mono-therapy group (DHI group or NXT group), Danhong Injection combined with Naoxintong Capsule (DHI-NXT) group significantly ameliorated neurological deficits scores, infarct volume and pathological change, significantly decreased the overexpression of NO and the level of Ang-1, significantly increased the expressions of VEGF, Ang-2, G-CSF, GM-CSF, bFGF, PDGF, vWF, TGF-β1. CONCLUSION: The protective benefits on rat brain against I/R injury were clearly produced when DHI and NXT were used in combination, which provided rational guidance for clinical combined application of DHI and NXT, and this protection maybe associated with the up-regulation expressions of the related chemokines and growth factors of angiogenesis.

29040936|t|Chemical profiling and quantification of Dan-Deng-Tong-Nao-capsule using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution hybrid quadruple-orbitrap mass spectrometry.
29040936|a|Dan-Deng-Tong-Nao capsule (DDTN) was a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, and has been widely used for the treatment of stroke clinically which caused by blood stasis. However, the bioactive substances and mechanism are unclear because of the complex compositions in DDTN. In this research, An ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with hybrid quadruple-orbitrap mass spectrometry (Q-Orbitrap MS) method was utilized to identify the chemical constituents of DDTN. In total, 102 compounds including diterpenes, lactones, flavonoids, and phenolic acids were identified by the accurate masses and fragmentation pathways, and 18 of them were unambiguously determined by comparison of reference standards. Besides, 12 representative compounds were simultaneously quantification analyzed and successfully applified for detecting in 9 batches of DDTN samples by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS in parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode. The proposed approach was validated to be satisfied in terms of linearity (0.9954-0.9999), LOD (0.771ng/mL), LOQ (2.568ng/mL), intra-day precision ( <2.68%), inter-day precision ( <4.52%), repeatability ( <2.96%), stability ( <3.21%), and recovery (94.6-105.5%). The results indicate that the method of combining UHPLC with Q-Orbitrap MS is practical and efficient for the chemical clarification in DDTN, and has great potential for the integrating quality control of other traditional Chinese medicines.

29374270|t|A retrospective cohort study on the outcomes of ischemic stroke patients with adjuvant Korean Medicine treatment.
29374270|a|This study aims to examine the long-term effect of adjuvant treatment in Korean Medicine (KM) clinics in ischemic stroke patients, using a national sample cohort from the National Health Insurance Service in Korea between 2010 and 2013. The National Health Insurance Service - National Sample Cohort database from 2002 to 2013 was used in this study. Ischemic stroke patients were defined and covariates were included to account for socioeconomic variables, comorbidities and disease severity. Propensity score matching was applied. Cox proportional hazards modeling and Kaplan-Meier analysis were applied to determine the differences between KM and non-KM treated groups. The results shows that KM-treated group had a higher probability of survival than non-KM group patients. No significant difference was observed between the risk of readmission between the treated and non-treated patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a weak effect of KM treatments in the patients with 8 to 28 days of hospital stay for a lower risk of recurrence than in non-treated patients. In conclusion, KM treatment of mild to moderate ischemic stroke patients has a mild effect on the survival probability of stroke. Its effect for improving long-term recurrence need to be explored in the future studies.

28904257|t|Prognostic Significance of Blood Urea Nitrogen in Acute Ischemic Stroke.
28904257|a|BACKGROUND: Prior studies have shown an association between high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and an elevated risk of mortality in heart failure patients, but data on the prognostic significance of BUN and other markers of kidney function in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients are sparse.Methods and Results:A total of 3,355 AIS patients were enrolled from December 2013 to May 2014, across 22 hospitals. Admission BUN was divided into quartiles (Q1, <4.39 mmol/L; Q2, ≥4.39 and <5.40 mmol/L; Q3, ≥5.40 and <6.70 mmol/L and Q4, ≥6.70 mmol/L) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), creatinine (Cr) and BUN/Cr were also categorized. Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of BUN, eGFR, Cr and BUN/Cr on all-cause in-hospital mortality and poor outcome on discharge (modified Rankin Scale score ≥3) in AIS patients. During hospitalization, 120 patients (3.6%) died from all causes and 1,287 (38.4%) had poor outcome at discharge. BUN was independently associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR for Q4 vs. Q1, 3.75; 95% CI: 1.53-9.21; P-trend=0.003) but not poor outcome at discharge (P-trend=0.229). No significant association was found, however, between reduced eGFR, increased Cr and BUN/Cr and all-cause in-hospital mortality and poor outcome at discharge (all P-trend ≥0.169). CONCLUSIONS: Increased BUN at admission is a significant prognostic factor associated with in-hospital mortality in AIS patients, but not with poor discharge outcome.

29383893|t|[Effect of Tiaoshen Kaiyu Acupuncture (Regulating Vitality and Dredging Stasis) Combined with Psychological Intervention on Patients of Mild Depression After Stroke].
29383893|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Tiaoshen Kaiyu acupuncture (regulating vitality and dredging stasis) combined with psychological intervention for treating mild depression after stroke. METHODS: Ninety-four patients were enrolled and were randomly divided into acupuncture (48 cases) and control (46 cases) groups. Patients in the control group were given standard treatment plus psychological intervention, while patients in the acupuncture group were treated with Tiaoshen Kaiyu acupuncture plus standard treatment and psychological intervention. Acupoints of Sishencong(EX-HN 1), Baihui(GV 20), and Yintang(EX-HN 3) were selected in the acupuncture group. Each group received treatment once daily, five times weekly, for a total of 6 weeks. A self-rating depression scale (SDS), Hamilton depression scale (HAMD), simplified Fugl-Meyer motor function assessment (FMA), and modified Barthel index (MBI) were used before and after treatment to evaluate the efficacy. RESULTS: After the treatment the four indexes were improved significantly compared with those before treatment in the acupuncture and control groups (P<0.01). The FMA and MBI scores in the acupuncture group were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The HAMD and SDS scores were significantly lower in the acupuncture group than in the control group (P<0.01). In both the acupuncture and control groups, the differences before and after treatment of the HAMD and FMA scores (rs＝0.332, P<0.01) and the HAMD and MBI scores (rs＝0.356, P<0.01) were positively correlated. CONCLUSION: Tiaoshen Kaiyu acupuncture combined with psychological intervention is more effective than psychological intervention therapy alone. The efficacy is correlated with motor function and mild depression scores of patients after stroke.

29371267|t|Electroacupuncture as an adjunctive therapy for motor dysfunction in acute stroke survivors: a systematic review and meta-analyses.
29371267|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) combined with rehabilitation therapy (RT) and/or conventional drugs (CD) for improving poststroke motor dysfunction (PSMD). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biological Medicine Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Cochrane Library, Medline and Embase were electronically searched from inception to December 2016. The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Statistical analyses were performed by RevMan V.5.3 and Stata SE V.11.0. RESULTS: Nineteen trials with 1434 participants were included for qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis. The methodological quality of the included trials was generally poor. The meta-analysis indicated that the EA group might be benefiting more than the non-EA group in terms of the changes in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale (FMA) (weighted mean difference (WMD): 10.79, 95% CI 6.39 to 15.20, P<0.001), FMA for lower extremity (WMD: 5.16, 95% CI 3.78 to 6.54, P<0.001) and activities of daily living (standardised mean difference: 1.37, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.96, P<0.001). However, there was no difference between EA and non-EA groups in terms of the effective rate (relative risk: 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.27, P=0.050). Moreover, there were not any reports of side effects due to EA combined with RT and/or CD in the included trials. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides new evidence for the effectiveness and safety of EA combined with RT and/or CD for PSMD. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously because of methodological weakness and publication bias. Further clinical trials with a rigorous design and large sample sizes are warranted.

29619066|t|Efficacy and Safety of the Injection of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Puerarin for the Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 53 Randomized Controlled Trials.
29619066|a|Objective: The injection of the traditional Chinese patent medicine puerarin has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases such as angina pectoris or ischemic stroke. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of puerarin injection for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in seven medical databases from their inception until June 2017. 53 studies with RCTs, totaling 3284 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. The included studies were assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias and analyzed by Review Manager 5.3 software. Results: The meta-analysis showed that puerarin injection for the treatment of DPN was significantly better compared with the control group in terms of the total effective rate. The result showed that puerarin injection for the treatment of DPN can significantly increase the probability of sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) of the median and peroneal nerves. Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrated that puerarin injection may be more effective and safe for the treatment of DPN. However, further and higher quality RCTs are required to prove its efficacy and provide meaningful evidence for clinical treatment due to the poor methodological quality.

29203245|t|KLF4 protects brain microvascular endothelial cells from ischemic stroke induced apoptosis by transcriptionally activating MALAT1.
29203245|a|In this study, we investigated the expression profile and functional role of Kruppel-like family of transcription factor 4 (KLF4) in mouse cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (MECs) after focal cerebral ischemia and in cultured b.End3 cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Its downstream regulation was also studied. Our data showed that KLF4 was significantly upregulated in the cerebral MECs after transient ischemic insult and in cultured b.End3 cells after 24 h OGD exposure. In in vitro b.End3 cell model, KLF4 shRNA significantly increased OGD-induced activation of caspase-3 and also increased OGD-induced b.End3 cell death. KLF4 shRNA substantially enhanced OGD induced Bim and Bax expression at mRNA and protein levels and also aggravated OGD induced upregulation of E-selectin, MCP-1 and IL-6. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that MALAT1 promoter has a possible KLF4 binding site. In this study, we validated this possible binding site and also demonstrated that enforced KLF4 expression increased MALAT1 transcription. Functionally, knockdown of MALAT1 phenocopied the effect of KLF4 shRNA on enhancing OGD induced cell apoptosis and OGD induced upregulation of pro-apoptotic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Based on these findings, we infer that MALAT1 is a transcriptional target of KLF4 in its protective role in cerebral MECs after ischemic insult.

29180227|t|Mechanism of salvianolic acid B neuroprotection against ischemia/reperfusion induced cerebral injury.
29180227|a|The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cerebral protection of salvianolic acid B (Sal B) against cerebral I/R injury and investigate the underlying mechanism. As shown by 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses, Sal B significantly reduced cerebral infarct size, and accompanied with improved neurobehavioral functions as indicated by the modified Bederson score and Longa five-point scale. Sal B decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (p < .05, n = 10). The data of Western blotting and reverse transcription quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses showed that the expression of GFAP, Iba1, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and Cleaved-caspase 3 was significantly reduced by Sal B in I/R injured brain tissues as compared to corresponding controls (p < .05, n = 10). Over activation of astrocytes and microglia were inhibited by Sal B as shown by immunostaining of GFAP and Iba 1. These data suggest that Sal B has neural protective effects against I/R-induced cerebral injury and could be an effective candidate for further development of clinical therapy.

29600004|t|Efficacy and safety of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in mild ischaemic stroke: a meta-analysis.
29600004|a|The benefits and safety of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) for patients with mild ischaemic stroke (MIS) are still unclear. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IV-tPA as treatment for patients with MIS. We performed a systematic literature search across MEDLINE, Embase, Central, Global Health and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), from inception to 10 November 2016, to identify all related studies. Where possible, data were pooled for meta-analysis with odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) using the fixed-effects model. MIS was defined as having National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of ≤6. We included seven studies with a total of 1591 patients based on the prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The meta-analysis indicated a high odds of excellent functional outcome based on the modified Rankin Scale or Oxfordshire Handicap Score 0-1 (OR=1.43; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.79; P=0.002, I2=35%) in patients treated with IV-tPA compared with those not treated with IV-tPA (74.8% vs 67.6%). There was a high risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) with IV-tPA treatment (OR=10.13; 95% CI 1.93 to 53.02; P=0.006, I2=0%) (1.9% vs 0.0%) but not mortality (OR=0.78; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.43; P=0.43, I2=0%) (2.4% vs 2.9%). Treatment with IV-tPA was associated with better functional outcome but not mortality among patients with MIS, although there was an increased risk of sICH. Randomised trials are warranted to confirm these findings.

30355926|t|Buyang Huanwu Decoction Attenuates Infiltration of Natural Killer Cells and Protects Against Ischemic Brain Injury.
30355926|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Natural killer (NK) cells are among the first immune cells that respond to an ischemic insult in human brains. The infiltrated NK cells damage blood-brain barrier (BBB) and exacerbate brain infarction. Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD), a classic Chinese traditional herbal prescription, has long been used for the treatment of ischemic stroke. The present study investigated whether BHD can prevent brain infiltration of NK cells, attenuate BBB disruption and improve ischemic outcomes. METHODS: Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by a 60-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion, and BHD was orally administrated at the onset of reperfusion, 12 hours later, then twice daily. Assessed parameters on Day 3 after ischemia were: neurological and motor functional deficits through neurological deficit score and rotarod test, respectively; brain infarction through TTC staining; BBB integrity through Evans blue extravasation; matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 activities through gelatin zymography; tight junction protein, nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) p65 and phospho-p65 levels through Western blotting; NK cell brain infiltration and CXCR3 levels on NK cells through flow cytometry; interferon-γ production through ELISA; CXCL10 mRNA levels through real-time PCR; CXCL10 expression and p65 nuclear translocation through immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: BHD markedly reduced brain infarction, improved rotarod performance, and attenuated BBB breakdown. Concurrently, BHD attenuated the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 activities and the degradation of tight junction proteins in the ischemic brain. Infiltration of NK cells was observed in the ischemic hemisphere, and this infiltration was blunted by treatment with BHD. BHD suppressed brain ischemia-induced interferon-γ and chemokine CXCL10 production. Furthermore, BHD significantly reduced the expression of CXCR3 on brain-infiltrated NK cells. Strikingly, BHD did not affect NK cell levels or its CXCR3 expression in the spleen or peripheral blood after brain ischemia. The nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 and phospho-p65 in the ischemic brain was inhibited by BHD. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that BHD prevents brain infiltration of NK cells, preserves BBB integrity and eventually improves ischemic outcomes. The inhibitory effects of BHD on NK cell brain invasion may involve its ability of suppressing NF-kB-associated CXCL10-CXCR3-mediated chemotaxis. Notably, BHD only suppresses NK cells and their CXCR3 expression in the ischemic brain, but not those in periphery.

29339666|t|Preventive Cold Acclimation Augments the Reparative Function of Endothelial Progenitor Cells in Mice.
29339666|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic cold exposure may increase energy expenditure and contribute to counteracting obesity, an important risk factor for cerebrocardiovascular diseases. This study sought to evaluate whether preventive cold acclimation before ischemia onset might be a promising option for preventing cerebral ischemic injury. METHODS: After a 14-day cold acclimation period, young and aged mice were subjected to permanent cerebral ischemia, and histological analyses and behavioral tests were performed. Mouse endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were isolated, their function and number were determined, and the effects of EPC transplantation on cerebral ischemic injury were investigated. RESULTS: Preventive cold acclimation before ischemia onset increased EPC function, promoted ischemic brain angiogenesis, protected against cerebral ischemic injury, and improved long-term stroke outcomes in young mice. In addition, transplanted EPCs from cold-exposed mice had a greater ability to reduce cerebral ischemic injury and promote local angiogenesis compared to those from control mice, and EPCs from donor animals could integrate into the recipient ischemic murine brain. Furthermore, transplanted EPCs might exert paracrine effects on cerebral ischemic injury, which could be improved by preventive cold acclimation. Moreover, preventive cold acclimation could also enhance EPC function, promote local angiogenesis, and protect against cerebral ischemic injury in aged mice. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive cold acclimation before ischemia onset improved long-term stroke outcomes in mice at least in part via promoting the reparative function of EPC. Our findings imply that a variable indoor environment with frequent cold exposure might benefit individuals at high risk for stroke.

29984673|t|The Efficacy and Safety of Pharmacological Treatments for Post-stroke Aphasia.
29984673|a|BACKGROUND: Aphasia is a common complication after stroke, and traditional speech and language therapy (SLT) has a limited effect on post-stroke aphasia (PSA). While there has been an increasing number of controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of drugs in the treatment of PSA, there have been very few systematic reviews on the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in people with PSA. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for PSA. METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRA), PubMed, Embase, Chinese Journal Full-text Database (CJFD), China Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc), Wanfang Data and VIP Information System were searched for randomized controlled trials about pharmacological treatments for PSA. Literature screening using the inclusion and exclusion criteria, data extraction and methodological quality assessment of the included studies were completed by two independent reviewers. Methodological quality was considered high for modified Jadad quality scale scores of 4 to 7. RevMan 5.3 software was used to conduct a meta-analysis of high-quality studies. RESULTS: Fifteen studies (578 participants) satisfied the eligibility criteria for this systematic review. Five trials (277 participants) assessed donepezil, four studies (124 participants) assessed memantine, three studies (72 participants) assessed bromocriptine, one trial (45 patients) evaluated galantamine, one study (21 patients) evaluated amphetamine, and one trial (39 patients) evaluated levodopa. The systematic review showed that donepezil achieved remarkable results in terms of the aphasia quotient (AQ) (SMD 0.82, 95% CI 0.48-1.17, P < 0.00001), repetition ability (SMD 0. 81, 95% CI 0.57-1.06, P < 0.00001), naming ability (SMD 0.56, 95% CI 0.29-0. 84, P < 0.00001), auditory comprehension (SMD 0.85, 95% CI 0.58-1. 13, P< 0.00001) and oral expression (SMD 0.90, 95% CI 0.54-1.26, P < 0.00001). Memantine showed no pronounced improvement in auditory comprehension (SMD 0.35, 95% CI -0.05-0.74, P = 0.09) but did improve the AQ (SMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.09-1.06, P = 0. 02), naming ability (SMD 0.81, 95% CI 0.38-1.25, P = 0.0002), spontaneous speech (SMD 0.76, 95% CI 0. 39- 1.13, P < 0.0001), and repetition ability (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.01-0.73, P = 0.04). Bromocriptine showed pronounced improvement in naming ability (SMD -0.20, 95% CI- 0.67-0.26, P = 0.39), verbal fluency (SMD 0.02, 95% CI 0.53-0.56, P = 0.95), and repetition ability (SMD 0.29, 95% CI -0.23-0. 81, P = 0.28). There is limited and inconclusive evidence for galantamine, amphetamine and levodopa. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that drugs, such as donepezil and memantine, can improve the prognosis of PSA. Donepezil has a significant effect in improving the ability of auditory comprehension, naming, repetition and oral expression. Memantine has a significant effect in improving the ability of naming, spontaneous speech and repetition. Bromocriptine showed no significant improvements in the treatment of aphasia after stroke. Data regarding galantamine, amphetamine and levodopa in the treatment of aphasia after stroke are limited and inconclusive.

30468129|t|Elevated Serum Human Cytomegalovirus IgM Levels in the Acute Phase of Ischemic Stroke are Associated with Increased Risk of Death and Major Disability.
30468129|a|BACKGROUND: There was a lack of studies on the association between Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and prognosis of ischemic stroke, although it was indicated that human cytomegalovirus DNA has played a role in several cardiovascular disorders. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between HCMV IgM levels in the acute phase and death and major disability after 2 weeks of acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Serum HCMV IgM levels were measured in 1150 participants in China. Study outcome data on major disability and combined outcome of death and major disability were collected at 2 weeks after stroke onset or hospital discharge. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of follow-up, 351 participants (30.52%) suffered from a major disability or died. Serum HCMV IgM was correlated with the combined outcome of death and major disability significantly after adjustment confounding factors. For example, the highest quartile of HCMV IgM was related to an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.84 (1.12-3.11) for the combined outcome. Risk prediction of the combined outcome was improved by the addition of serum HCMV IgM to conventional risk factors (net reclassification index 25.41%, p＝0.0002; integrated discrimination improvement 0.70%, p＝0.04377). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum HCMV IgM levels in the acute phase of ischemic stroke were correlated with increased risk of combined outcome of death and major disability, indicating that serum HCMV IgM could be an important predictive factor for poor prognosis of ischemic stroke.

29952413|t|Long-term risk of rosiglitazone on cardiovascular events - a systematic review and meta-analysis.
29952413|a|Rosiglitazone has been proposed as a treatment strategy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and it could provide robust glucose-lowering capability with risk of cardiovascular events. We thus performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials to assess the effect of this treatment on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM. We systematically search PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials comparing rosiglitazone to other anti-diabetic treatments. These studies included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies that had treatment with at least six months of follow-up in patients with T2DM. We aimed to evaluate the long-term effect on cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone compared with a basal insulin drug. The main outcomes included myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. We included 11RCTs and four observational studies involving 20,079 individuals with T2DM allocated to rosiglitazone and a similar number to comparison groups of which only five compared rosiglitazone with placebo and collected data on cardiovascular outcomes. Among patients with T2DM, rosiglitazone is associated with a significantly increased risk of heart failure, with little increased risk of myocardial infarction, without a significantly increased risk of stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality compared with placebo or active controls. Alternative methods to reduce the uncertainty in long-term pragmatic evaluations, inclusion of rosiglitazone in factorial trials, publication of cardiovascular outcome data from adverse event reporting in trials of rosiglitazone and a cardiovascular endpoint trial of rosiglitazone among people without diabetes.

The quality of the studies was assessed and data were extracted by 2 independent investigators. The random-effects model was used to estimate the impact of good vs. poor collateral circulation, as well as baseline characteristics, on the outcome within the series presented as risk ratios. Subgroup analyses explored the potential factors that may interfere with the effects of the collateral circulation status on the outcome. A total of 29 studies comprising 4,053 patients were included in the present meta-analysis. A good collateral circulation status was revealed to have a beneficial effect on favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0-3 at 3-6 months; P<0.001) and a higher rate of recanalization (P<0.001) compared with poor collateral circulation. Good collateral circulation was also associated with a lower rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (P<0.01), a lower rate of mortality (P<0.01) and a smaller infarct size (P<0.01). In conclusion, good collateral circulation was demonstrated to have a favorable prognostic value regarding the outcome for patients with AIS receiving thrombolysis treatment. Assessment of collateral circulation and penumbra area during pre-treatment imaging within an appropriate time-window prior to thrombolytic therapy will therefore improve the identification of AIS patients who may benefit from thrombolysis treatment.

29650371|t|Turo (Qi Dance) Program for Parkinson's Disease Patients: Randomized, Assessor Blind, Waiting-List Control, Partial Crossover Study.
29650371|a|CONTEXT: Qigong, Tai-chi and dancing have all been proven effective for Parkinson's disease (PD); however, no study has yet assessed the efficacy of Turo, a hybrid qigong dancing program developed to relieve symptoms in PD patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Turo may provide benefit in addressing the symptoms of PD patients. DESIGN: Randomized, assessor blind, waiting-list control, partial crossover study. SETTING: Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 32 PD patients (mean age 65.7 ± 6.8). INTERVENTION: Participants were assigned to the Turo group or the waiting-list control group. The Turo group participated in an 8-week Turo training program (60-minute sessions twice a week). The waiting-list control group received no additional treatment during the same period; then underwent the same 8-week Turo training. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a score on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and the secondary outcomes included the perceived health status assessed using the Parkinson's disease Quality of Life questionnaire (PDQL), balance function as assessed by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the results of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: The Turo group showed statistically significant improvements in the UPDRS (P < 0.01) and PDQL (P < 0.05) as compared to the control group. The changes in BBS scores displayed a tendency toward improvement, but was not statistically significant (P = 0.051). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Turo PD training might improve the symptoms of PD patients.

29244265|t|Herpes Zoster and Dementia: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.
29244265|a|OBJECTIVE: Some infectious diseases have been found to be associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the relationship between herpes zoster and dementia has received little attention. This study aimed to investigate this association as well as associations of antiviral treatments for herpes zoster and incident dementia using a large national sample. METHODS: Cases were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database with a new diagnosis of herpes zoster (ICD-9-CM code: 053) between 1997 and 2013. Each identified individual with a case of herpes zoster was compared with 1 sex-, age-, and residence-matched control subject. Both groups were followed until the first diagnosis of dementia (ICD-9-CM codes: 290.0 to 290.4, 294.1, 331.0 to 331.2, and 331.82), withdrawal from the registry, or the end of 2013. Cox regression analyses and competing risk model were applied, adjusting for sex, age, residence, depression, autoimmune disease, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, alcohol use disorder, and antiviral treatments for herpes zoster to evaluate the risk of interest. RESULTS: A total of 39,205 cases with herpes zoster were identified. Of the 78,410 study and comparison subjects, 4,204 were diagnosed as having dementia during a mean (SD) follow-up period of 6.22 (4.05) years. Herpes zoster was associated with a slightly increased risk of dementia in the fully adjusted model (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17). Prescriptions of antiviral therapy were associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia following the diagnosis of herpes zoster (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40-0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Herpes zoster was associated with an increased risk of dementia, independent of potential confounding factors. Antiviral treatment might be protective in preventing dementia in patients with herpes zoster.

29243061|t|Neuroprotective Effect of Curcumin Against Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Via Mediating Autophagy and Inflammation.
29243061|a|Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound extracted from Curcuma longa, has drawn attention for its effective bioactivities against ischemia-induced injury. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of curcumin and investigate the underlying mechanism that mediates autophagy and inflammation in an animal model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Curcumin was delivered to Sprague Dawley male rats at a dose of 200 mg/kg curcumin by intraperitoneal injection 30 min after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). LY294002, a specific inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, as well as anisomycin, an activator of TLR4/p38/MAPK, was administered by ventricle injection 30 min before MCAO. The same volume of saline was given as a control. Brain infarction and neurological function were determined 24 h post-MCAO. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used to detect alterations in autophagy-relevant proteins Akt, p-Akt, mTOR, p-mTOR, LC3-II, and LC3-I, and inflammation-related proteins TLR4, p-38, p-p38, and IL-1 in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Cerebral I/R injury resulted in significant alterations of LC3-II/LC3-I, IL-1, TLR4, and p-p38. Curcumin in MCAO rats significantly improved brain damage and neurological function by upregulating p-Akt and p-mTOR and downregulating LC3-II/LC3-I, IL-1, TLR4, p-38, and p-p38. However, these protective effects against ischemia could be suppressed when LY294002 or anisomycin was included. Curcumin exerts neuroprotective effects by attenuating autophagic activities through mediating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, while also suppressing an inflammatory reaction by regulating the TLR4/p38/MAPK pathway. Furthermore, this study indicates that curcumin could be an effective therapy for patients afflicted with ischemia.

29336875|t|Systems pharmacology dissection of the anti-stroke mechanism for the Chinese traditional medicine Xing-Nao-Jing.
29336875|a|Xing-Nao-Jing (XNJ) is a well-known injection that has been extensively applied in clinical treatment of stroke in China. However, the underlying mechanism of clinical administration of XNJ in stroke remains unclear. In this study, a systems pharmacology strategy based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data was applied to analyze the pharmacological effect of XNJ on stroke. Sixteen active compounds were filtered from XNJ through Drug-likeness (DL) and Brain-blood-barrier (BBB) evaluations. Ninety-four potential targets of these active components were identified by SysDT and SEA. Biological process and pathway enrichment analyses of these targets demonstrated that XNJ exerted anti-stroke effects by biological processes and pathways, such as the response to oxidative stress, regulation of blood pressure, calcium signaling pathway, and apoptosis. Integrating the compound-target network and stroke-related PPI network, we found that Akt1, HIF-1α and ITGB2 may play key roles in the treatment of stroke. The experiments demonstrated that oxycurcumenol may prevent PC12 cells from oxidative stress-induced cell damage. Our study indicates that XNJ has an effect on stroke by protecting neuro cells from oxidative stress-induced cell damage via HIF1α, and the research strategy at the systems pharmacology level is feasible to reveal the mechanisms of novel lead compounds from natural products.

28986200|t|Serum Alkaline Phosphatase, Phosphate, and In-Hospital Mortality in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients.
28986200|a|BACKGROUND: The clinical impacts of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and phosphate on early death are not fully understood in patients with acute ischemic stroke. We examined the associations between serum ALP, phosphate, and in-hospital mortality after ischemic stroke. METHODS: Serum ALP and phosphate were measured in 2944 ischemic stroke patients from 22 hospitals in Suzhou City from December 2013 to May 2014. Cox proportional hazard models and restricted cubic splines were used to estimate the relationships between serum ALP and phosphate (both as categorical and continuous variables) and risk of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During hospitalization, 111 patients (3.7%) died from all causes. After multivariable adjustment, the hazard ratio (HR) of the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile of ALP was 2.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-4.00) for early death. Restricted cubic spline analysis indicated a significant linear association between ALP and death (P-linearity = .017). A U-shaped association of phosphate with in-hospital mortality was observed (P-nonlinearity = .011). Compared with the third quartile of phosphate (1.08-1.21 mmol/L), HRs of the lowest and highest quartiles for early death were 2.17 (1.15-4.08) and 1.70 (.88-3.30), respectively. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed our findings. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a graded relationship between serum ALP levels and risk of early death in patients with acute ischemic stroke. There was a U-shaped association between phosphate and all-cause mortality with significantly increased risk among patients with lower phosphate levels.

28958661|t|MMP Gene Polymorphisms, MMP-1 -1607 1G/2G, -519 A/G, and MMP-12 -82 A/G, and Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis.
28958661|a|BACKGROUND: Several polymorphisms in the human gene encoding MMP have been investigated for the association with ischemic stroke (IS) in the population, of which the MMP-1 -1607 1G/2G, -519 A/G, and MMP-12 -82 A/G polymorphisms gain more and more attention; however, the results are controversial and ambiguous. We therefore carried out the meta-analysis to yield a valid conclusion. METHODS: The literature database was comprehensively searched to identify potentially eligible reports. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies with 3237 cases and 3075 controls were included in this meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant association in MMP-1 -1607 1G/2G and MMP-12 -82 A/G gene polymorphisms, but none was observed in MMP-1 -519 A/G. When a subgroup analysis by ethnicity and HWE, MMP-12 -82 A/G gene polymorphisms may be a risk factor for IS in Europe. In Africa, MMP-1 -1607 1G/2G and MMP-12 -82 A/G also showed a significant effect on IS. Further investigation on a larger sample size of different ethnic populations is needed to confirm the findings.

29257220|t|Curcumin improves diabetes mellitus‑associated cerebral infarction by increasing the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3.
29257220|a|Curcumin is characterized by anti‑inflammatory, anti‑oxidative, antiviral, antifibrotic, anticoagulation and glucose regulatory functions. However, whether it is protective in diabetes mellitus‑associated cerebral infarction remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, it was demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that curcumin markedly improved neurological deficits, cerebral infarct volume and brain edema rate following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery. It was also shown that the expression levels of glucose transporter (GLUT)1 and GLUT3 were reduced in the MCAO group. However, following curcumin treatment, the levels of GLUT1 and GLUT3 were markedly increased. In addition, curcumin markedly decreased cell apoptosis, indicating an anti‑apoptotic role of curcumin in the brain. To further evaluate whether curcumin prevented cell apoptosis by modulating the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3, small interfering RNAs targeting GLUT1 and GLUT3 were selected. It was found that the knockdown of GLUT1 and GLUT3 inhibited the abundance of GLUT1, GLUT3 and B‑cell lymphoma 2, even following incubation with curcumin. These data showed that curcumin protected brain cells from apoptosis and cerebral infarction, predominantly by upregulating GLUT1 and GLUT3.

28629771|t|Chemokines play complex roles in cerebral ischemia.
28629771|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) is a disease caused by deficiency of blood and oxygen in focal or complete brain, followed by inflammation cascade and other pathological reactions, which finally lead to irreversible damage to the cerebrum. For the inflammation is a key progress at the initiation of ischemia and poststroke, and chemokines work as vital cytokines in inflammation, we focus the roles of chemokines in IS. Studies have shown cerebral ischemia is associated with marked induction of both CXC and CC chemokines which resulting in extensive leukocyte infiltration in the ischemic brain, and neutrophil infiltration may increase cerebral edema inducing injury in the ischemic area. In addition, chemokines also shows other functions such as promote neuroblast migration, hematogenous cell recruitment and functional brain repair. Thus, a similar chemokine ligand/chemokine receptor pair can mediate both beneficial and detrimental effects depending on the window of observation and pathophysiological conditions. This manuscript reviews the studies about chemokine-mediated effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and discusses the potential significance of these interactions in injury and repair of ischemic tissues. We also refer drug development based on the chemokines and clinical applications using chemokines as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in ischemic stroke.

29758953|t|Electroacupunture contributes to recovery of neurological deficits in experimental stroke by activating astrocytes.
29758953|a|BACKGROUND: Neurological deficits is one of the most prevalent clinical manifestation after stroke. The effects of astrocytes activated by electroacupunture (EA) after stroke on the neurological recovery in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats was not clear and definite. OBJECTIVE: Our previous study showed that treatment with EA for 7 days contributed to the activation of astrocytes in MCAO rats. The purposes of this study were to 1) confirm the effects of EA for 14 days on activation of astrocytes in MCAO rats, and 2) test the relationships between activation of astrocytes and neurological functional recovery induced by EA in MCAO rats. METHODS: All rats were randomly divided into five groups: naïve control group, sham control control group, MCAO, MCAO/EAn, MCAO/EAd (n = 8, for each group). Rats in MCAO/EAn group received EA treatment at acupoints of Neiguan (PC06). MCAO/EAd group received EA stimulus at acupoints of Diji (SP08). The primary indicators were locomotor recovery, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: The neurological deficit and histopathological improvements and activation of astrocytes were observed after EA treatment at acupoints PC06. Parametric correlation analyses revealed a cubic correlation relationship between activation of astrocytes and neurological recovery of MCAO rats treated with EA. CONCLUSION: EA treatment at the acupoints of Neiguan involved in the regulation of activation of astrocytes, which our data suggested has a cubic correlation relationship with the neurological recovery of MCAO rats.

29312110|t|α-Asarone Attenuates Cognitive Deficit in a Pilocarpine-Induced Status Epilepticus Rat Model via a Decrease in the Nuclear Factor-κB Activation and Reduction in Microglia Neuroinflammation.
29312110|a|Background: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most drug-resistant types of epilepsy with about 80% of TLE patients falling into this category. Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation, which has a critical role in the epileptogenesis of TLE, is associated with microglial activation. Therefore, agents that act toward the alleviation in microglial activation and the attenuation of neuroinflammation are promising candidates to treat TLE. α-Asarone is a major active ingredient of the Acori Graminei Rhizoma used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, which has been used to improve various disease conditions including stroke and convulsions. In addition, an increasing number of studies suggested that α-asarone can attenuate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Thus, we hypothesized that α-asarone is a promising neuroprotective agent for the treatment of the TLE. Methods: The present study evaluated the therapeutic effects of α-asarone on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo, using an untreated control group, a status epilepticus (SE)-induced group, and an SE-induced α-asarone pretreated group. A pilocarpine-induced rat model of TLE was established to investigate the neuroprotective effects of α-asarone in vivo. For the in vitro study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary cultured microglial cells were used. Results: The results indicated that the brain microglial activation in the rats of the SE rat model led to important learning and memory deficit. Preventive treatment with α-asarone restrained microglial activation and reduced learning and memory deficit. In the in vitro studies, α-asarone significantly suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production in primary cultured microglial cells and attenuated the LPS-stimulated neuroinflammatory responses. Our mechanistic study revealed that α-asarone inhibited inflammatory processes by regulation the transcription levels of kappa-B, by blocking the degradation pathway of kappa B-alpha [inhibitor kappa B-alpha (IκB-α)] and kappa B-beta (IκB-β) kinase in both the SE rats and in primary cultured microglial cells. Conclusion: Taken together, these data demonstrate that α-asarone is a promising neuroprotective agent for the prevention and treatment of microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory conditions including TLE, for which further assessment studies are pertinent.

29220346|t|Decreased Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio Predicts Poor Prognosis of Acute Ischemic Stroke Treated with Thrombolysis.
29220346|a|BACKGROUND Our previous study found that lower lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) is an independent risk factor of clinical outcome of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, whether lower LMR is independently associated with adverse prognosis of AIS treated with thrombolysis has not been determined. In this study, we explored the relationship between LMR and prognosis of AIS treated with thrombolysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 108 patients treated with thrombolysis. LMR was calculated according to lymphocyte count and monocyte count on admission. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to LMR values on admission (group 1 LMR >4.34, group 2 LMR 2.79 to 4.34, group 3 LMR <2.79). Neurologic impairment was estimated by use of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale. Clinical prognosis at 3 months was assessed by modified Rankin Scale. The relationship between LMR and neurologic impairment was analyzed by Spearman rank correlation. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluate the ability of LMR to predict outcome. RESULTS Patients in group 3 had lower lymphocyte counts and LMR values and higher monocyte counts (P<0.001). LMR value was negatively correlated with the degree of neurologic impairment (r=-0.372, P<0.001). The ROC suggested a moderate sensitivity (71.6%) and specificity (80.5%) of LMR for predicting prognosis with an optimal cut-off point at 3.48. Higher LMR value was an independent protective factor against adverse prognosis (odds ratio 0.683, 95% confidence interval 0.490-0.952, P=0.024). CONCLUSIONS A lower LMR value is an independent predictor of poor prognosis of AIS treated with thrombolytic therapy.

29340078|t|Differential gene expression profiles between two subtypes of ischemic stroke with blood stasis syndromes.
29340078|a|Ischemic stroke is a cerebrovascular thrombotic disease with high morbidity and mortality. Qi deficiency blood stasis (QDBS) and Yin deficiency blood stasis (YDBS) are the two major subtypes of ischemic stroke according to the theories of traditional Chinese medicine. This study was conducted to distinguish these two syndromes at transcriptomics level and explore the underlying mechanisms. Male rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, QDBS/MCAO group and YDBS/MCAO group. Morphological changes were assessed after 24 h of reperfusion. Microarray analysis with circulating mRNA was then performed to identify differential gene expression profile, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were carried out to predict the gene function, gene co-expression and pathway networks were constructed to identify the hub biomarkers, which were further validated by western blotting and Tunel staining analysis. Three subsets of dysregulated genes were acquired, including 445 QDBS-specific genes, 490 YDBS-specific genes and 1676 blood stasis common genes. Our work reveals for the first time that T cell receptor, MAPK and apoptosis pathway were identified as the hub pathways based on the pathway networks, while Nfκb1, Egfr and Casp3 were recognized as the hub genes by co-expression networks. This research helps contribute to a clearer understanding of the pathological characteristics of ischemic stroke with QDBS and YDBS syndrome, the proposed biomarkers might provide insight into the accurate diagnose and proper treatment for ischemic stroke with blood stasis syndrome.

29262474|t|[Clinical application of electrical velocimetry in monitoring pediatric blood volume after cardiopulmonary bypass].
29262474|a|Objective: To investigate the clinical applicability of electrical velocimetry (EV) in monitoring pediatric blood volume after cardiopulmonary bypass. Method: Between July 2016 and November 2016, 60 children with congenital heart disease were divided into EV group and traditional central venous pressure (CVP) group randomly. For EV group, the volume of fluid and vascular active medicine was adjusted according to the monitoring stroke volume variation (SVV) hemodynamic parameters. Whereas for CVP group empirical volume of fluid infusion was managed by the monitoring traditional hemodynamic parameters such as CVP, blood pressure, heart rate, urine volume and blood gas analysis.Heart rate (HR), mean artery pressure (MAP), blood lactic acid (LA), oxygenation index (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) at 2, 4 and 6 h after operation were observed and compared between two groups. Mechanical ventilation time and ICU monitoring time were also compared between two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to investigate the significance of SVV and inferior vena cava expansion index (dIVC) for evaluating of reactivity capacity after surgery. Result: MAP level was significantly higher in EV group at 2, 4, and 6 h after operation [ (62±10) vs. (50±6) mmHg(1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), (68±11) vs.(59±4) mmHg, (71±6) vs. (63±8) mmHg respectively; t=5.580 9, 4.530 1, 4.308 1; P=0.001, 0.002, 0.001]. PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was higher in EV group than that of CVP group[ (362±23) vs. (310±43), (380±33) vs. (330±38), (386±57) vs. (350±63.1) respectively, t=5.818 8, 5.419 2, 2.317 2; P=0.002, 0.001, 0.024]. However HR and blood lactic acid level was lower in EV group than the CVP group [(166±10) vs. (179±14)/min, (156±11) vs. (168±16)/min, (138±10) vs. (149±13)/min respectively; t=3.930 7, 3.511 1, 3.671 5; P=0.002, 0.009, 0.005]; [7% vs. 33%, 3% vs. 20%, 0 vs. 13%, χ(2)=5.104 2、4.043 1、4.285 7, P=0.045 3, 0.044 4, 0.038 4] respectively; Mechanical ventilation time [ (4.3±0.7) vs. (8.2±0.8) h, P=0.008] and ICU monitoring time [ (16.4±3.2) vs. (21.2±2.6) h,P=0.003] was shorter in EV group than that in group CVP. Pearson correlation analysis suggested that the SVV and dIVC have significant positive correlation. Conclusion: SVV monitoring using EV could help to guide perioperative fluid management for children with congenital heart disease. Real time dynamic monitoring SVV improves liquid infusion management more timely, accurately, and avoids excessive or insufficient blood volume load which is associated with leading to organ dysfunction.

29344421|t|Anti-Aging Implications of Astragalus Membranaceus (Huangqi): A Well-Known Chinese Tonic.
29344421|a|Owing to a dramatic increase in average life expectancy and the Family Planning program of the 1970s - 1990s, China is rapidly becoming an aging society. Therefore, the investigation of healthspan-extending drugs becomes more urgent. Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi) is a major medicinal herb that has been commonly used in many herbal formulations in the practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat a wide variety of diseases and body disorders, or marketed as life-prolonging extracts for human use in China, for more than 2000 years. The major components of Astragalus membranaceus are polysaccharides, flavonoids, and saponins. Pharmacological research indicates that the extract component of Astragalus membranaceus can increase telomerase activity, and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, anticancer, hypolipidemic, antihyperglycemic, hepatoprotective, expectorant, and diuretic effects. A proprietary extract of the dried root of Astragalus membranaceus, called TA-65, was associated with a significant age-reversal effect in the immune system. Our review focuses on the function and the underlying mechanisms of Astragalus membranaceus in lifespan extension, anti-vascular aging, anti-brain aging, and anti-cancer effects, based on experimental and clinical studies.

29344420|t|The Effects of Baicalin and Baicalein on Cerebral Ischemia: A Review.
29344420|a|Ischemic stroke, producing a high mortality and morbidity rate, is a common clinical disease. Enhancing the prevention and control of ischemic stroke is particularly important. Baicalin and its aglycon baicalein are flavonoids extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis, an important traditional Chinese herb. In recent years, a growing body of evidences has shown that baicalin and baicalein could be effective in the treatment of cerebral ischemia. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that baicalin could penetrate the blood-brain barrier and distribute in cerebral nuclei. Through a variety of in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic neuronal injury, numerous studies have demonstrated that baicalin and baicalein have salutary effect for neuroprotection. Especially, the studies on the pharmacological mechanism showed that baicalin and baicalein have several pharmacological activities, which include antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxicity effects, protection of the mitochondria, promoting neuronal protective factors expression and adult neurogenesis effects and many more. This review focuses on the neuroprotective effects of baicalin and baicalein in ischemia or stroke-induced neuronal cell death. We aimed at collecting all important information regarding the neuroprotective effect and its pharmacological mechanism of baicalin and baicalein in various in vivo and in vitro experimental models of ischemic neuronal injury.

28433415|t|Effects of Transferring to the Rehabilitation Ward on Long-Term Mortality Rate of First-Time Stroke Survivors: A Population-Based Study.
28433415|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term health outcomes of acute stroke survivors transferred to the rehabilitation ward. DESIGN: Long-term mortality rates of first-time stroke survivors during hospitalization were compared among the following sets of patients: patients transferred to the rehabilitation ward, patients receiving rehabilitation without being transferred to the rehabilitation ward, and patients receiving no rehabilitation. SETTING: Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N = 11,419) with stroke from 2005 to 2008 were initially assessed for eligibility. After propensity score matching, 390 first-time stroke survivors were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess differences in 5-year poststroke mortality rates. RESULTS: Based on adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), the patients receiving rehabilitation without being transferred to the rehabilitation ward (adjusted HR, 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-3.57) and patients receiving no rehabilitation (adjusted HR, 4.00; 95% CI, 2.55-6.27) had significantly higher mortality risk than the patients transferred to the rehabilitation ward. Mortality rate of the stroke survivors was affected by age ≥65 years (compared with age <45y; adjusted HR, 3.62), being a man (adjusted HR, 1.49), having ischemic stroke (adjusted HR, 1.55), stroke severity (Stroke Severity Index [SSI] score≥20, compared with SSI score<10; adjusted HR, 2.68), and comorbidity (Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index [CCI] score≥3, compared with CCI score=0; adjusted HR, 4.23). CONCLUSIONS: First-time stroke survivors transferred to the rehabilitation ward had a 5-year mortality rate 2.2 times lower than those who received rehabilitation without transfer to the rehabilitation ward and 4 times lower than those who received no rehabilitation.

29329654|t|UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-based metabolomics coupled with metabolomics pathway analysis method for exploring the protection mechanism of Kudiezi injection in a rat anti-ischemic cerebral reperfusion damage model.
29329654|a|Kudiezi injection has been used extensively in the treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. However, its therapeutic effects and underlying mechanism of action are not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to clarify the protective mechanisms of Kudiezi injection on cerebral ischemic injury, using metabolomics methods. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was introduced in rats to build the cerebral ischemic damage. UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-based analytical method was established for analysis of the metabolites. The raw mass data of all samples were normalized with Sieve 2.2 software and then introduced to orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model. Finally, 23 metabolites in plasma (15 were tentatively identified) were chosen as potential biomarkers, according to accurate mass measurements (< 5 ppm), MS/MS fragmentation patterns, and diagnostic product ions. Furthermore, on the basis of metabolic pathway analysis via metabolomics pathway analysis (MetPA), we first discovered that the protection mechanism in anti-ischemic cerebral reperfusion damage of Kudiezi injection was possibly related to the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. The present study provided a useful approach for exploring the mechanism of ischemic stroke and evaluating the efficacy of Kudiezi injection or other traditional medicines.

29243783|t|Research on the nutrition and cognition of high-risk stroke groups in community and the relevant factors.
29243783|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence rate of nutritional risk in high-risk stroke groups in community, analyze its influencing factors, and analyze and compare the relationship between nutritional risk or malnutrition assessed by different nutritional evaluation methods and cognitive function, so as to provide the basis and guidance for clinical nutritional assessment and support. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was performed for 1196 cases in high-risk stroke groups in community from December 2015 to January 2017. At the same time, the nutritional status of patients was evaluated using the mini nutritional assessment (MNA) and MNA-short form (MNA-SF), and the cognitive status of patients was evaluated using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Moreover, the relevant influencing factors of nutritional risk and MMSE score were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: High-risk stroke groups in community suffered from a high risk of malnutrition. MNA-SF had a higher specificity and lower false positive rate than MNA. Nutritional risk occurred more easily in high-risk stroke groups in community with a history of diabetes mellitus, less physical exercise or light manual labor, daily use of multiple drugs, and higher age. Those with a higher nutritional risk were more prone to cognitive impairment. High-risk stroke groups in community, complicated with hyperhomocysteinemia, daily use of three or more kinds of prescription drugs, and a previous history of stroke, were accompanied by cognitive impairment easily. CONCLUSIONS: MNA-SF can be used for the nutritional screening of high-risk stroke groups in community. For the high-risk stroke groups in community, the rational nutritional diet should be publicized, blood sugar should be controlled in a scientific manner and physical exercise should be moderately increased.

29039453|t|MicroRNA-125a-3p is involved in early behavioral disorders in stroke-afflicted rats through the regulation of Cadm2.
29039453|a|Ischemic strokes carry a significant risk of mortality and recurrent vascular events. Recent studies suggest that changes in microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) may affect the development of the stroke. However, few studies have investigated the role of miRNAs in behavioral disorder in early stroke. In the present study, animal models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) are used, as well as a cell model of neurite outgrowth to further investigate the role of miRNAs in targeting synapse-associated proteins expression in early stroke. The authors used miRNA expression microarrays on RNA extracted from the cortex tissue samples from the rats of MCAO and control rats. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conducted to verify the candidate miRNAs discovered by microarray analysis. Data indicated that miR‑125a was significantly increased in the cortex of the model of MCAO, which were concomitant with that rats of MCAO at the same age displayed significant behavioral deficits. Bioinformatics analysis predicted the cell adhesion molecule 2 (Cadm2, mRNA) neurite outgrowth-associated protein is targeted by miR‑125a. Overexpression of miR‑125a reduced the level of Cadm2 expression in PC12 cell injury induced by free-serum. In contrast, inhibition of miR‑125a using miR‑125a inhibitors significantly resulted in higher levels of Cadm2 expression. In conclusion, miR‑125a is involved in the behavioral disorder of animal models of MCAO by regulation of Cadm2.

29238467|t|Neuroprotection of a sesamin derivative, 1, 2-bis [(3-methoxyphenyl) methyl] ethane-1, 2-dicaroxylic acid (MMEDA) against ischemic and hypoxic neuronal injury.
29238467|a|Objectives: Stroke may cause severe neuronal damage. The sesamin have been demonstrated to possess neuroprotection by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. One sesamin derivative was artificially composited, 1, 2-bis [(3-methoxyphenyl) methyl] ethane-1, 2-dicaroxylic acid (MMEDA) had been developed to study its antioxidative activity and neuroprotection. Materials and Methods: The infaction of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and hypoxia models of BV-2 microglia or PC12 cells were investigated for in vivo and in vitro test respectively. Lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and related signaling pathways from hypoxic cells were analyzed by ELISA or Western blot assay, respectively. Results: MMEDA showed a protective effect when given 90 min after the focal cerebral ischemia. The neuroprotection of MMEDA was further confirmed by attenuating ROS and PGE2 release from hypoxic BV-2 or PC12 cells. MMEDA significantly reduced hypoxia-induced JNK and caspase-3 (survival and apoptotic pathways) in PC12 cells. Conclusion: The neuroprotective effect of MMEDA on ischemia/hypoxia models was involved with its antioxidative activity and anti-inflammatory effects. These results suggest that MMEDA exert effective neuroprotection against ischemia/hypoxia injury.

28527041|t|Mechanisms of Acupuncture Therapy for Cerebral Ischemia: an Evidence-Based Review of Clinical and Animal Studies on Cerebral Ischemia.
28527041|a|Ischemic stroke is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. As a part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), acupuncture has been shown to be effective in promoting recovery after stroke. In this article, we review the clinical and experimental studies that demonstrated the mechanisms of acupuncture treatment for cerebral ischemia. Clinical studies indicated that acupuncture activated relevant brain regions, modulated cerebral blood flow and related molecules in stroke patients. Evidence from laboratory indicated that acupuncture regulates cerebral blood flow and metabolism after the interrupt of blood supply. Acupuncture regulates multiple molecules and signaling pathways that lead to excitoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, neurons death and survival. Acupuncture also promotes neurogenesis, angiogenesis as well as neuroplasticity after ischemic damage. The evidence provided from clinical and laboratory suggests that acupuncture induces multi-level regulation via complex mechanisms and a single factor may not be enough to explain the beneficial effects against cerebral ischemia.

29390393|t|Quick needle insertion at pharyngeal acupoints for poststroke dysphagia: A case report.
29390393|a|RATIONALE: Dysphagia following stroke is a major complaint among patients, and effective treatment of post-stroke dysphagia can be difficult. We present a case report describing a new treatment for dysphagia, namely, quick needle insertion at pharyngeal acupoints. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old man developed pharyngeal dysphagia after a stroke. Three months after the patient experienced a sudden stroke leading to liquid dysphagia, acupuncture, one of the most important therapies in Traditional Chinese Medicine, was used to treat the patient. DIAGNOSES: A diagnosis of cerebral infarction and bulbar paralysis was made. INTERVENTIONS: Quick needle insertion was performed at five pharyngeal acupoints, once a day, 6 times a week for 6 weeks. OUTCOMES: The patient subsequently showed significant improvement in the pharyngeal phase of swallowing. His performance in the drinking water test reduced to level 1 from level 4. The functional oral intake scale score changed from level 2 to level 7. In the video fluoroscopic swallowing study, no spillage occurred, but aspiration was present. The residue of the contrast agent was reduced. LESSONS: Quick needle insertion at pharyngeal acupoints can be an efficient way to treat post-stroke dysphagia.

29310330|t|Can catheter ablation reduce the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation?: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.
29310330|a|Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is a major risk factor for thromboembolic events, especially ischemic stroke. Catheter ablation is an effective method to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with AF. Although some observational studies have shown a relatively lower stroke rate after catheter ablation, whether catheter ablation can reduce the thromboembolic risk in patients with AF remains unclear. We aim to perform a systematic review to determine whether catheter ablation can prevent thromboembolism in patients with AF.PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library will be searched from January 2000 to the present for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies on catheter ablation in patients with AF. Other relevant sources, such as the references and conference proceedings, will also be manually retrieved. All studies will be limited to publication in English. The primary outcome will be thromboembolic events, including stroke, transient ischemic attack, and systemic embolic events. Study screening, data collection, and study quality assessment will be independently performed by 2 researchers. Disagreements will be resolved through team discussion or consultation with a third arbitrator. The risk of bias will be appraised using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale according to the different study designs, and a meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan V.5.3 software. The results will be presented as risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous data and continuous outcomes.Catheter ablation is an effective method to cure atrial fibrillation and maintain sinus rhythm. Although it is intuitive that if AF is eliminated, the thromboembolism in the heart would be abolished, and sequently the incidence of thromboembolic events would be decreased, this in fact has not yet been clarified. This systematic review and meta-analysis will be performed with the aim of comprehensively identifying studies that have reported the impact of AF ablation on thromboembolic events in patients with non-valvular AF by comparing an ablation group and non-ablation group. These outcomes will not only produce useful evidence-based data regarding the influence of catheter ablation on thromboembolic events in patients with AF but will also provide some guidance regarding anticoagulation regimens in patients who have undergone catheter ablation.

29245245|t|Therapeutic effect of Chinese herbal medicines for post stroke recovery: A traditional and network meta-analysis.
29245245|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is a condition with high morbidity and mortality, and 75% of stroke survivors lose their ability to work. Stroke is a burden to the family and society. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese herbal patent medicines in the treatment of patients after the acute phase of a stroke. METHODS: We searched the following databases through August 2016: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), China Science Periodical Database (CSPD), and China Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc) for studies that evaluated Chinese herbal patent medicines for post stroke recovery. A random-effect model was used to pool therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal patent medicines on stroke recovery. Network meta-analysis was used to rank the treatment for each Chinese herbal patent medicine. RESULTS: In our meta-analysis, we evaluated 28 trials that included 2780 patients. Chinese herbal patent medicines were effective in promoting recovery after stroke (OR, 3.03; 95% CI: 2.53-3.64; P < .001). Chinese herbal patent medicines significantly improved neurological function defect scores when compared with the controls (standard mean difference [SMD], -0.89; 95% CI, -1.44 to -0.35; P = .001). Chinese herbal patent medicines significantly improved the Barthel index (SMD, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-0.94; P < .001) and the Fugl-Meyer assessment scores (SMD, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34-0.86; P < .001). In the network analysis, MLC601, Shuxuetong, and BuchangNaoxintong were most likely to improve stroke recovery in patients without acupuncture. Additionally, Mailuoning, Xuesaitong, BuchangNaoxintong were the patented Chinese herbal medicines most likely to improve stroke recovery when combined with acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that the Chinese herbal patent medicines were effective for stroke recovery. The most effective treatments for stroke recovery were MLC601, Shuxuetong, and BuchangNaoxintong. However, to clarify the specific effective ingredients of Chinese herbal medicines, a well-designed study is warranted.

29323038|t|Electroacupuncture improves neurovascular unit reconstruction by promoting collateral circulation and angiogenesis.
29323038|a|Acupuncture at Shuigou (GV26) shows good clinical efficacy for treating stroke, but its mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, a cerebral infarction model of ischemia/reperfusion injury received electroacupuncture at GV26 (15 Hz and 1 mA, continuous wave [biphasic pulses], for 5 minutes). Electroacupuncture effectively promoted regional cerebral blood flow on the infarct and non-infarct sides, increased infarct lesions, lectin, and number of blood vessels, upregulated von Willebrand factor and cell proliferation marker Ki67 expression, and diminished neurological severity score. These findings confirm that electroacupuncture at GV26 promotes establishment of collateral circulation and angiogenesis, and improves neurological function

29157819|t|Pro-angiogenic effects of Ilexsaponin A1 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro and zebrafish in vivo.
29157819|a|BACKGROUND: Ilexsaponin A1 is the major bioactive ingredient of Ilex pubescens Hook. et Arn. This plant has been conventionally used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases including stroke, coronary arterial disease, and peripheral vascular diseases. PURPOSE: To investigate the pro-angiogenic effect of Ilexsaponin A1 and its mechanism of action. STUDY DESIGN: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli1:EGFP) were employed as an in vitro and in vivo model respectively. METHODS: Pro-angiogenic effects of Ilexsaponin A1 were examined by assessing endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation. The mechanism of pro-angiogenic effects was investigated by measuring the expression level of various signalling proteins. Furthermore, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor II (VRI)-induced vascular insufficient transgenic zebrafish model was used to confirm the results of the HUVECs results in vivo. RESULTS: Ilexsaponin A1 significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation in HUVECs, and rescued blood vessel loss in VRI-induced vascular insufficient zebrafish. Ilexsaponin A1 upregulated p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-Src, p-FAK, p-MEK, and p-Erk1/2 in HUVECs. CONCLUSION: This study showed that Ilexsaponin A1 exhibits pro-angiogenic activity in HUVECs and VRI-induced vascular insufficient zebrafish, probably by activating Akt/mTOR, MAPK/ERK and Src- and FAK-dependent signalling pathways. The findings suggest that Ilexsaponin A1 and probably I. pubescens, a major source of Ilexsaponin A1, could be developed as a potential therapeutic agent for preventing or treating cardiovascular diseases and/or other diseases related to vascular insufficiency.

29029334|t|Effect of long-term hydroxychloroquine on vascular events in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a database prospective cohort study.
29029334|a|Objectives: The incidence of thromboembolism in patients with SLE is higher than that in the general population. HCQ, widely used to treat lupus, may have vascular protective effects. The aim of this study was to determine whether long-term HCQ exposure is associated with decreased thromboembolism risk in SLE. Methods: We designed a prospective cohort study within an SLE population based on the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. We divided participants into HCQ and control groups according to HCQ prescription during the first year. These groups were defined by medication possession ratio (MPR) ⩾80% and MPR = 0%, respectively. Patients with an MPR between 0 and 80% were excluded. The primary outcome was a composite vascular event, including acute coronary syndrome, ischaemic stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and peripheral arterial disease 1 year after inclusion. We excluded patients from the cohort if they had outcomes within the first year. Results: A total of 8397 patients were eligible for analysis. After propensity-score matching, we included 1946 patients in each group. During a mean follow-up of 7.4 years, the number of events was 139 in the HCQ group (7.1%) and 149 in the control group (7.7%). The risk of vascular events in the HCQ group was similar to that in the control group (hazard ratio = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.15). Further subgroup analyses confirmed no statistically significant differences between the groups. Conclusion: Long-term HCQ appears to have no vascular protective effect in patients with SLE.

28580536|t|Annexin A2 Plus Low-Dose Tissue Plasminogen Activator Combination Attenuates Cerebrovascular Dysfunction After Focal Embolic Stroke of Rats.
28580536|a|Previous studies showed recombinant annexin A2 (rA2) in combination with low-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) improved thrombolytic efficacy and long-term neurological outcomes after embolic focal ischemia in rats. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of the combination in early BBB integrity and cerebrovascular patency in the rat focal embolic stroke model. Ischemic brain infarct volume and hemorrhagic transformation were quantified at 24 h after stroke. At an earlier time point, 16 h after stroke, BBB integrity was evaluated by IgG extravasation, and the involved mechanisms were assessed for tight junction ZO-1 and adhesion junction ve-cadherin protein expression, matrix metalloproteinase activation, extracellular matrix collagen IV and endothelial barrier antigen expression, and activation of microglia/macrophages and astrocytes. While at the same time point, cerebrovascular patency was assessed by intravascular fibrin and platelet depositions. At 24 h after stroke, the combination showed significant reduction in brain infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage. At 16 h after stroke onset, the combination therapy significantly reduced BBB disruption, and improved preservation of the junction proteins ZO-1 and ve-cadherin, decreased activation of matrix metalloproteinase, inhibited degradation of extracellular matrix collagen IV and endothelial barrier antigen, and reduced microglia/macrophage and astrocytes activations. Meanwhile, the combination also significantly improved cerebrovascular patency by reducing intravascular fibrin and platelet depositions in the peri-infarct brain tissues. These results suggest the beneficial effects of the rA2 plus low-dose tPA combination may be mediated in part by the amelioration of BBB disruption and improvement of cerebrovascular patency.

29493142|t|[Stroke, platelet activating factor and receptor antagonists].
29493142|a|Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity, disability and mortality. The prevention and treatment conditions for stroke is severe all over the world. Antiplatelet aggregation is an effective treatment. Platelet activation factor (PAF) is another important medium in mediating platelet aggregation, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of stroke. In recent years, PAF receptor antagonists have attracted international attention in the field of stroke prevention and treatment. In this review, we would summarize the classification, mechanism and drug characteristics of PAF receptor antagonists in order to provide the valuable guidance and direction for clinical medicine and research.

29493141|a|To further evaluate the safety of ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection in the clinical use in ischemic stroke patients. Clinical safety study was conducted in 82 clinical units and 6 300 cases were completed and included from June 2013 to December 2014 by using multicenter, prospective, open and uncontrolled design methods for clinical research. A total of 29 cases of adverse reactions were observed in the experiment. Adverse reaction ratio (ADR) was 0.46%, and about 86.21% (25 cases) of them was mild with transient response which could be alleviated or disappeared without intervention; about 13.79% (4 cases) was moderate, including 2 cases of headache, 1 case of dizziness and 1 case of rash; no serious adverse reactions were found. The adverse reactions occurred in this study were pre-known adverse reactions or common adverse reactions of Chinese medicine injection. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was low, and the risk was controllable.

28663053|t|Protective effect of electroacupuncture on neurons autophagy in perfusion period of cerebral ischemia.
28663053|a|Electroacupuncture (EA) is an important treatment method in Chinese traditional medicine. The main purpose of the investigation was to explore whether EA could improve cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) via neurons' autophagy. 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) was applied to establish cerebral ischemia model and reperfusion 12h, 24h and 48h respectively were conduct 3h later. TTC staining was applied to assess cerebral infarction area and the concentrations of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, SOD and MDA were detected by commercial kits. The expressions of autophagy-related protein LC3, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Beclin1 were measured by Western blot. EA treatment was given at "BaiHui", "MingMen" and "ZuSanLiXue". The obtained results from TTC showed that the severity of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion was improved with EA treatment. Oxidative and inflammatory damages were also alleviated with EA intervention. Meanwhile, western blot analysis revealed the decreased levels of LC3 and Beclin1 in EA rats, as well as the elevated level of mTOR. Besides, our previous study found that EA can enhance mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity, reduce mitochondrial damage and inhibit neuronal apoptosis further. Thus, it is assumed that 4-VO-induced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion might be alleviated by EA through inhibiting neurons' excessive autophagy in reperfusion period.

29285302|t|Telomere length associated with the risks of high-risk and ischemic stroke in southern Chinese Han population.
29285302|a|Some previous studies suggested telomere length was associated with the risk of ischemic stroke (IS). The aim of this study was to further confirm the association between relative telomere length (RTL) and risk of IS and to especially explore its correlation with the risk of high-risk stroke population in southern Chinese Han. RTL was determined by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction from 400 ischemic stroke patients, 409 high-risk stroke populations and 399 healthy controls. The correlations between the controls and the risk of high-risk and ischemic stroke were evaluated by using an unconditional logistic regression. IS patients have shown longer RTL than controls (median1.52vs1.11, p60 years) and gender suggested that the first and second tertile of RTL were correlated with the risk of IS in each group when the second tertile was used as a reference. However, the increased risk for high-risk stroke populations were only presented in the first tertile of RTL in the age≤60 years and female groups. the RTL was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, while it elevated the risk of high-risk stroke in some specific subpopulations.

28743390|t|Baicalin attenuates in vivo and in vitro hyperglycemia-exacerbated ischemia/reperfusion injury by regulating mitochondrial function in a manner dependent on AMPK.
28743390|a|Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a lethal and disabling disease. Studies have suggested that hyperglycemia is a risk factor for cerebral I/R. Baicalin is a natural bioactive flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi with neuroprotective activity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of baicalin on hyperglycemia-exacerbated cerebral I/R injury. Streptozotocin (STZ) injection aggravated the brain damage induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery, while baicalin administration reduced blood glucose, relieved neurological deficit and decreased infarct volume. In vitro, Oxygen-glucose deprivation/ reperfusion (OGD/REP) induced inordinate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dynamic impairments were markedly increased under high glucose (HG) condition. Baicalin treatment in PC12 cells inhibited dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) expression, decreased mitochondrial fission, promoted mitofusin-2 (MFN2) generation, increased Drp-1 Ser637 phosphorylation, and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) via the suppression of ROS production. However, AMPKα1 knockdown abolished the protective effects of baicalin. Baicalin also suppressed cell apoptosis and enhanced mitophagy. These results suggested that baicalin protected against hyperglycemia aggravated I/R injury by regulating mitochondrial functions in a manner dependent on AMPK.

29133791|t|Network pharmacology exploration reveals endothelial inflammation as a common mechanism for stroke and coronary artery disease treatment of Danhong injection.
29133791|a|Although Danhong injection (DHI) is the most widely prescribed Chinese medicine for both stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD), its underlying common molecular mechanisms remain unclear. An integrated network pharmacology and experimental verification approach was used to decipher common pharmacological mechanisms of DHI on stroke and CAD treatment. A compound-target-disease & function-pathway network was constructed and analyzed, indicating that 37 ingredients derived from DH (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge., Flos Carthami tinctorii and DHI) modulated 68 common targets shared by stroke and CAD. In-depth network analysis results of the top diseases, functions, pathways and upstream regulators implied that a common underlying mechanism linking DHI's role in stroke and CAD treatment was inflammatory response in the process of atherosclerosis. Experimentally, DHI exerted comprehensive anti-inflammatory effects on LPS, ox-LDL or cholesterol crystal-induced NF-κB, c-jun and p38 activation, as well as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 secretion in vascular endothelial cells. Ten of 14 predicted ingredients were verified to have significant anti-inflammatory activities on LPS-induced endothelial inflammation. DHI exerts pharmacological efficacies on both stroke and CAD through multi-ingredient, multi-target, multi-function and multi-pathway mode. Anti-endothelial inflammation therapy serves as a common underlying mechanism. This study provides a new understanding of DHI in clinical application on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

29354949|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy difference between TIE 's flying acupuncture combined with conventional treatment and conventional treatment alone on acute cerebral infarction hemiplegia. METHODS: A total of 120 patients were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 60 cases in each one. The control group was treated with conventional treatment, including anti-platelet aggregation, lipid-lowering, formula of traditional Chinese medicine which could promote circulation and remove stasis, neurotrophic medication and symptomatic treatment; mannitol was used for cerebral infarction with large area or increased intracranial pressure. Based on the conventional treatment applied in the control group, the observation group was treated with flying acupuncture at the affected Jianyu (LI 15), Quchi (LI 11), Shousanli (LI 10), Waiguan (TE 5), Hegu (LI 4), Huantiao (GB 30), Biguan (ST 31), Futu (ST 32), Zusanli (ST 36), etc. The treatment was given once a day, six days per week, for totally 2 weeks. The simplified Fugl-Meyer score, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and ADL-Bathel index (BI) score were evaluated before and after treatment in the two groups. RESULTS: After the treatment, the simplified Fugl-Meyer and BI were significantly increased in both groups (all P<0.05), which was significantly higher in the observation group (both P<0.05); after the treatment, the NIHSS was significantly lowered in both groups (both P<0.05), which was significantly lower in the observation group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: TIE 's flying acupuncture combined with conventional treatment were effective for acute cerebral infarction hemiplegia, which have better efficacy than conventional treatment on improving motor function, neurological deficit and daily living ability, and the pain is mild.

29127417|t|The positive effects of Xueshuan Xinmai tablets on brain functional connectivity in acute ischemic stroke: a placebo controlled randomized trial.
29127417|a|Through a placebo controlled randomized study, the purpose of this report was to investigate the effects of Xueshuan Xinmai tablets (XXMT) on neurologic deficits, quality of life and brain functional connectivity in acute ischemic stroke patients and to explore the mechanism of action of XXMT. In total, 44 acute ischemic stroke patients were randomly divided to the XXMT treatment group (n = 22) or the placebo group (n = 22) in a 2-week trial. Before and after the treatment, the neurological assessment and functional magnetic resonance imaging examinations were carried out. Compared to the placebo group, the scores of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SSQOL) significantly improved in the treatment group. In addition, XXMT-treated patients demonstrated significantly enhanced functional connectivity within the default mode, frontal-parietal, and motor control networks. Furthermore, the changed connectivity in the left precuneus was positively correlated to the improvement of NIHSS and SSQOL scores. The present study indicated that XXMT treatment significantly improved the neurologic deficit and quality of life of acute ischemic stroke patients and that the therapeutic effect may be based on the modulation of XXMT on the functional connectivity of brain networks.

29122785|t|Naoxuekang, Xinnaoshutong and Xuesaitong capsules for treating stroke: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
29122785|a|INTRODUCTION: After stroke, hemiplegia, dysphasia and facial paralysis can manifest during the convalescent period. Currently, no Chinese patent medicine (CPM) is previously reported to cure each of these symptoms primarily, and thus, there are no relevant instructions for the use of CPM. This study presents a new approach based on comparative effectiveness research to distinguish the curative effects of three CPMs that are often used in stroke convalescence to determine the ideal medicine for the treatment of each symptom. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multicentre and double-blind clinical trial, stratified randomisation is used to group the patients according to their primary symptoms (hemiplegia, dysphasia and facial paralysis). Three strata will be enrolled, with 80 eligible participants included in each stratum. Each stratum will be randomly and equally divided into four groups, and each group will receive one of the following treatments: Naoxuekang, Xinnaoshutong (XNST), Xuesaitong (XST) or placebo. This study will include two stages: the initial treatment period (30 days) and a follow-up period (180 days). Three replicates for each data point will be completed during this trial. The first visit will occur on day 0 after enrolment, the second visit on day 30±2 and the third visit on day 210±5. The Delphi technique is adopted to achieve index weighting, which ensures that the evaluation outcome is patient oriented. The weighted index value will be computed as the final measurement index of the outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (registration number TJUTCM-EC20160007). The results will be offered for publication in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IOR-17010397). The date of registration was 11 January 2017.

28736035|t|Propane-2-sulfonic acid octadec-9-enyl-amide, a novel PPARα/γ dual agonist, protects against ischemia-induced brain damage in mice by inhibiting inflammatory responses.
28736035|a|Propane-2-sulfonic acid octadec-9-enyl-amide (N15), an analogue of oleoylethanolamide (OEA), is a novel PPARα/γ dual agonist. Our previous studies verified the positive effects of OEA on the acute and delayed stages of cerebral ischemia. However, it is not clear whether N15 is effective against ischemic cerebral injury. In the present study, male Kunming mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). To evaluate its preventive effects, N15 (50, 100 or 200mg/kg, ip) was administered for 3days before ischemia. To evaluate its therapeutic effects, N15 (200mg/kg, ip) was administered 1h before reperfusion or 0, 1, 2 or 4h after reperfusion. Neurological deficit scores, infarct volume and the degree of brain oedema were determined at 24h after reperfusion. Blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption was evaluated by Evans blue (EB) and FITC-dextran leakages at 6h after reperfusion. The activation/inflammatory responses of microglia/macrophages were detected using immunohistochemistry and western blot. N15 pretreatment improved neurological dysfunction, reduced infarct volume and alleviated brain oedema in a dose-dependent manner; the most effective dose was 200mg/kg. The therapeutic time window was within 2h after reperfusion. N15 treatment preserved the BBB integrity and suppressed the activation of microglia/macrophages. N15 inhibited inflammatory cytokine expression not only in MCAO mice but also in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells. Additionally, N15 markedly decreased the phosphorylation levels of NF-κBp65, STAT3, and ERK1/2 both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the PPARα antagonist MK886 or PPARγ antagonist T0070907 respectively partly abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of N15 in vitro. Our findings demonstrated that N15 can exert neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic insult. Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of N15 on cerebral ischemia may be attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties, at least in part, by enhancing PPARα/γ dual signaling and inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB, STAT3, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. These findings suggest that N15 may be a potential therapeutic choice for the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke.

28905238|t|Methological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on acupuncture for stroke: A review of review.
28905238|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding acupuncture intervention for stroke and the primary studies within them. METHODS: Two researchers searched PubMed, Cumulative index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Ovid Medline, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and Traditional Chinese Medical Database to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses about acupuncture for stroke published from the inception to December 2016. Review characteristics and the criteria for assessing the primary studies within reviews were extracted. The methodological quality of the reviews was assessed using adapted Oxman and Guyatt Scale. The methodological quality of primary studies was also assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-two eligible reviews were identified, 15 in English and 17 in Chinese. The English reviews were scored higher than the Chinese reviews (P=0.025), especially in criteria for avoiding bias and the scope of search. All reviews used the quality criteria to evaluate the methodological quality of primary studies, but some criteria were not comprehensive. The primary studies, in particular the Chinese reviews, had problems with randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, dropouts and withdrawals, intent-to-treat analysis and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Important methodological flaws were found in Chinese systematic reviews and primary studies. It was necessary to improve the methodological quality and reporting quality of both the systematic reviews published in China and primary studies on acupuncture for stroke.

29122267|t|Effects of traditional Chinese exercises on the rehabilitation of limb function among stroke patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
29122267|a|OBJECTIVE: To systematically review literature about the rehabilitative effects of traditional Chinese exercises (TCEs) on limb function among patients with stroke. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Twelve electronic databases were searched from their inceptions to February 2017, including PudMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBase, Science Direct, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and WanFang Data. RCTs were located to examine the rehabilitative effects of TCEs on limb function among stroke patients. Two authors independently screened the literature, extracted data and assessed the risk bias of the included studies. Methodological quality evaluation and meta-analysis of included studies was performed by using Cochrane Collaboration's tool (RevMan 5.3). RESULTS: A total of 31 RCTs with 2349 participants were included. Results of meta-analysis showed that TCEs produced positive effects on limb motor function (random effects model, standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66 to 1.77, P < 0.01), balance function{Berg balance scale: (random effects model, SMD = 2.07, 95%CI = 1.52 to 2.62, P < 0.01), timed-up-and-go test: (fixed effects model, mean difference [MD] = -1.77, 95%CI = -2.87 to -0.67, P < 0.01)}, activities of daily living (ADL) ability {Barthel Index scale: (random effects model, MD = 15.60, 95%CI = 7.57 to 23.63, P < 0.01), Modified Barthel Index scale: (random effects model, MD = 12.30, 95%CI = 7.48 to 17.12, P < 0.01)}, and neurological impairment (fixed effects model, MD = -2.57, 95%CI = -3.14 to -2.00, P < 0.01). After subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis, the positive effects did not be affected by different types of TCEs and different lengths of intervention time. However, TCEs were no benefit to physical function on Short Physical Performance Battery and 2-min Step Test among stroke patients. CONCLUSION: Current evidence showed that TCEs produced positive effects on limb motor function, balance function, ADL ability and neurological impairment among stroke patients. More large-scale, high-quality, multiple center RCTs are required to further verify above conclusions in the future.

29016795|t|Leonurine Exerts Antidepressant-Like Effects in the Chronic Mild Stress-Induced Depression Model in Mice by Inhibiting Neuroinflammation.
29016795|a|Background: Leonurine is an active alkaloid that is extracted from Traditional Chinese Medicine Herba leonuri. Emerging evidence indicates that leonurine produces neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the effect of leonurine in neuropsychiatric disorders, especially in major depression, remains unknown. Methods: We used the chronic mild stress mouse model to explore the antidepressant effects of leonurine and the potential mechanisms. Behavioral tests including sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test were taken to evaluate depression symptoms. Moreover, the contents of monoamine neurotransmitters in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Neuronal morphology was detected by transmission electron microscopy. Results: Administration of leonurine (60 mg/kg) for 4 weeks significantly alleviated depression-like behaviors of chronic mild stress mice, including increased sucrose preference and reduced immobility time in forced swimming test and tail suspension test. We further found that leonurine (60 mg/kg) effectively restored the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline, and dopamine in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of chronic mild stress mice, accompanied by amelioration of hippocampal neuronal damage. Furthermore, leonurine (60 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and TNF-α, and suppressed the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that leonurine exerts antidepressant-like effects, which may be mediated, at least in part, by improving monoamine neurotransmitters and inhibiting neuroinflammation. Our study provides insight into the potential of leonurine in depression therapy.

29119732|t|Metabolic benefits of rivaroxaban in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients after radiofrequency catheter ablation.
29119732|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rivaroxaban is a new oral anticoagulant for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), which has less drug-food interaction than warfarin. We conducted this prospective randomized study to evaluate the metabolic benefits as well as the safety and efficacy with rivaroxaban versus warfarin in patients with NVAF following radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). METHODS: From April to July 2014, 60 patients with NVAF undergoing RFCA were prospectively enrolled in our study. Following RFCA, all patients were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban (Group R, n=30) or warfarin (Group W, n=30). Metabolic indices including serum total protein, albumin, globulin, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) as well as bleeding, stroke, and systemic thromboembolism events were evaluated and compared during follow-up after 15, 30, 60, and 90 d of RFCA procedure. RESULTS: Serum total protein, albumin, globulin, and HDL levels were all significantly elevated at each follow-up stage in Group R when compared to the baseline (P<0.05 respectively). In Group W, the metabolic indices decreased at first and then had an increasing trend. There were no deaths or thromboembolic complications in each group. The prevalence of total bleeding complications was similar between Group R and Group W (11/30, 36.7% vs. 10/30, 33.3%, P=0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NVAF receiving rivaroxaban after RFCA procedures appear to benefit from a metabolic perspective compared with warfarin, providing practical clinical reference for the choice of the anticoagulant. Rivaroxaban seems to be as safe and effective in preventing thromboembolic events as warfarin for these patients.

29382021|t|Altered effective connectivity of resting state networks by acupuncture stimulation in stroke patients with left hemiplegia: A multivariate granger analysis.
29382021|a|The aim of this study was to explore the response feature of resting-state networks (RSNs) of stroke patients with left hemiplegia by acupuncture stimulation.Nineteen stroke patients with left hemiplegia and 17 controls were recruited in this study. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data before and after acupuncture were acquired using magnetic scanning. The independent component analysis (ICA) was employed to extract RSNs related to motion, sensation, cognition, and execution, including sensorimotor network (SMN), left and right frontoparietal network (LFPN and RFPN), anterior and posterior default mode network (aDMN, pDMN), visual network (VN), and salience network (SN). Granger causality method was used to explore how acupuncture stimulation affects the causality between intrinsic RSNs in stroke patients. Compared with healthy subjects, stroke patients presented the more complex effective connectivity. Before acupuncture stimulation, LFPN inputted most information from other networks while DMN outputted most information to other networks; however, the above results were reversal by acupuncture. In addition, we found aDMN reside in between SMN and LFPN after acupuncture.The finding suggested that acupuncture probably integrated the effective connectivity internetwork by modulating multiple networks and transferring information between LFPN and SMN by DMN as the relay station.

28944915|t|Neuroprotective effect of total flavonoids from Ilex pubescens against focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.
28944915|a|Ilex pubescens is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and stroke. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Ilex pubescens total flavonoids (IPTF) on neuroprotection and the potential mechanisms in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Rats were pretreated with intragastric administration of IPTF at doses of 200 and 100 mg/kg for 5 days; middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery was then performed to induce cerebral I/R injury. Neurological deficits were determined using the 5‑point neurological function score evaluation system, brain infarct sizes were determined by 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and alterations in brain histology were determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The neurological deficit score, the infarcted area and the brain tissue pathological injury were significantly reduced when the rats were pretreated with IPTF. In addition, inflammatory mediators and neurotrophic factors in the brain were investigated. IPTF pretreatment decreased the activities of total nitric oxide synthase (TNOS), induced NOS (iNOS) and constitutive NOS (cNOS), and the levels of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β) and tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), however, it increased the levels of IL‑10 in brain tissues. Furthermore, pretreatment with IPTF also increased the protein expressions of brain‑derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell‑derived neurotrophic factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, when compared with the model group. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that IPTF has a neuroprotective effect against focal cerebral I/R injury in rats. The mechanism may be associated with the decreased production of certain proinflammatory cytokines including NO, IL‑1β, TNF‑α, TNOS, iNOS and cNOS, the increased production of the anti‑inflammatory cytokine IL‑10 and the increased secretion of neurotrophic factors.

29018128|t|Island Sign: An Imaging Predictor for Early Hematoma Expansion and Poor Outcome in Patients With Intracerebral Hemorrhage.
29018128|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to investigate the usefulness of the computed tomography (CT) island sign for predicting early hematoma growth and poor functional outcome. METHODS: We included patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who had undergone baseline CT within 6 hours after ICH symptom onset in our hospital between July 2011 and September 2016. Two readers independently assessed the presence of the island sign on the admission noncontrast CT scan. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between the presence of the island sign on noncontrast admission CT and early hematoma growth and functional outcome. RESULTS: A total of 252 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Among them, 41 (16.3%) patients had the island sign on baseline noncontrast CT scans. In addition, the island sign was observed in 38 of 85 patients (44.7%) with hematoma growth. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the time to baseline CT scan, initial hematoma volume, and the presence of the island sign on baseline CT scan independently predicted early hematoma growth. The sensitivity of the island sign for predicting hematoma expansion was 44.7%, specificity 98.2%, positive predictive value 92.7%, and negative predictive value 77.7%. After adjusting for the patients' age, baseline Glasgow Coma Scale score, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, admission systolic blood pressure, baseline ICH volume, and infratentorial location, the presence of the island sign (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-9.81; P=0.017) remained an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with ICH. CONCLUSIONS: The island sign is a reliable CT imaging marker that independently predicts hematoma expansion and poor outcome in patients with ICH. The noncontrast CT island sign may serve as a potential marker for therapeutic intervention.

29089640|t|Acute and long-term cardioprotective effects of the Traditional Chinese Medicine MLC901 against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice.
29089640|a|MLC901, a traditional Chinese medicine containing a cocktail of active molecules, both reduces cerebral infarction and improves recovery in patients with ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute and long-term benefits of MLC901 in ischemic and reperfused mouse hearts. Ex vivo, under physiological conditions, MLC901 did not show any modification in heart rate and contraction amplitude. However, upon an ischemic insult, MLC901 administration during reperfusion, improved coronary flow in perfused hearts. In vivo, MLC901 (4 µg/kg) intravenous injection 5 minutes before reperfusion provided a decrease in both infarct size (49.8%) and apoptosis (49.9%) after 1 hour of reperfusion. Akt and ERK1/2 survival pathways were significantly activated in the myocardium of those mice. In the 4-month clinical follow-up upon an additional continuous per os administration, MLC901 treatment decreased cardiac injury as revealed by a 45%-decrease in cTnI plasmatic concentrations and an improved cardiac performance assessed by echocardiography. A histological analysis revealed a 64%-decreased residual scar fibrosis and a 44%-increased vascular density in the infarct region. This paper demonstrates that MLC901 treatment was able to provide acute and long-term cardioprotective effects in a murine model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo.

28743077|t|Characterization and quantitative analysis of phenolic derivatives in Longxuetongluo Capsule by HPLC-DAD-IT-TOF-MS.
28743077|a|Longxuetongluo Capsule (LTC), which is derived from the total phenolic extract of Chinese dragon's blood, has been proved to be safe as well as effective towards ischemic stroke. However, the effective material basis remains unclear. The present study thereby focused on the clarification of the qualitative and quantitative properties for the phenolic derivatives in LTC. Regarding homolog-focused chemical profiling, the mass fragmentation patterns of the primary subtypes of phenolic compounds such as homoisoflavanones, flavanes, chalcones, and flavonoid oligomers were summarized by assaying authentic references with hybrid ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and the chemical structures of 124 phenolic compounds, in total, were unambiguously or tentatively annotated in LTC by matching the accurate mass spectral profiles with the proposed mass cracking rules and those reference substances. Afterwards, simultaneous determination of 12 primary phenolic compounds was carried out in different batches of LTC using HPLC-DAD, after that the method was proved to be accurate, precise, and reproducible according to diverse method validation assays. The obtained findings are expected to be meaningful for clarifying the effective substances and quality assessment of LTC.

28882886|t|Potential Cardiovascular and Total Mortality Benefits of Air Pollution Control in Urban China.
28882886|a|BACKGROUND: Outdoor air pollution ranks fourth among preventable causes of China's burden of disease. We hypothesized that the magnitude of health gains from air quality improvement in urban China could compare with achieving recommended blood pressure or smoking control goals. METHODS: The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-China projected coronary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause deaths in urban Chinese adults 35 to 84 years of age from 2017 to 2030 if recent air quality (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm, PM2.5) and traditional cardiovascular risk factor trends continue. We projected life-years gained if urban China were to reach 1 of 3 air quality goals: Beijing Olympic Games level (mean PM2.5, 55 μg/m3), China Class II standard (35 μg/m3), or World Health Organization standard (10 μg/m3). We compared projected air pollution reduction control benefits with potential benefits of reaching World Health Organization hypertension and tobacco control goals. RESULTS: Mean PM2.5 reduction to Beijing Olympic levels by 2030 would gain ≈241,000 (95% uncertainty interval, 189 000-293 000) life-years annually. Achieving either the China Class II or World Health Organization PM2.5 standard would yield greater health benefits (992 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 790 000-1 180 000] or 1 827 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 1 481 00-2 129 000] annual life-years gained, respectively) than World Health Organization-recommended goals of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% reduction in smoking combined (928 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 830 000-1 033 000] life-years). CONCLUSIONS: Air quality improvement in different scenarios could lead to graded health benefits ranging from 241 000 life-years gained to much greater benefits equal to or greater than the combined benefits of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% smoking reduction.

29201548|t|Risk factors of carotid plaque and carotid common artery intima-media thickening in a high-stroke-risk population.
29201548|a|Introduction: To analyze the risk factors of carotid plaque (CP) and carotid common artery intima-media thickening (CCAIMT) and the association between the risk factors and CP numbers and the side of the CCAIMT in a high-stroke-risk population. Methods: Carotid ultrasonography was conducted in 2025 participants with high stroke risk. Participants were divided into different groups according to the results of the ultrasound. The risk factors and blood biochemical indices were recorded. Results: The presence of CP and CCAIMT were 38.9% and 24.8% respectively. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that the risk factors of CP were age, high LDL-C and FBG levels, male gender, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, and tobacco use. Compared with participants without CPs, the participants who were male, and older in age, with risk factors of tobacco use, diabetes, high LDL-C levels, and a family history of hypertension were likely to have a single CP, whereas the participants with risk factors of tobacco use, diabetes, hypertension, male gender, older age, high LDL-C levels, stroke and AF or valvulopathy were prone to have multiple CPs. The risk factors of CCAIMT were male gender, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, AF or valvulopathy, tobacco use and age. Compared with the N-CCAIMT subgroup, the risk factors of left CCAIMT were tobacco use, diabetes, male gender, and age. The risk factors of right CCAIMT were male gender, high FBG levels, age, AF or valvulopathy. The risk factors of dual CCAIMT were high frequency of drinking milk, tobacco use, male gender, age, stroke, and hypertension. Conclusion: These findings revealed the risk factors of CP and CCAIMT, and an association between the risk factors and the CP numbers and the side of the CCAIMT.

29354969|t|[Therapeutic effect observation of post-stroke shoulder pain treated with the touching-periosteum needling technique of the meridian muscle region theory].
29354969|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pain severity, the motor function of the upper limb and the quality of life in the patients of post-stroke shoulder pain treated with the touching-periosteum needling technique of the meridian muscle region theory. METHODS: One hundred and six cases of post-stroke shoulder pain were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 53 cases in each one. In the observation group, the touching-periosteum needle technique and the rehabilitation training were used on the bases of the theory of meridian muscle region. The points were Jianyuci, Binaoci, Jianliaoci, Jianqianci, Quchi (LI 11), Shousanli (LI 10) and Waiguan (TE 5) on the affected side. The needles were inserted obliquely, at 45°degrees at those extra points to the tendon knots till the needle tips touching periosteum. The needles were manipulated to ensure the qi arrival and then retained for 30 min. The rehabilitation was applied, such as the anti-spasmodic posture, bridge-style movement on the bed, weight transition and balance training, joint activity maintenance training, passive and active movement of shoulder joint, the training for activities of daily living (ADL) and Bobath technique. In the control group, the routine acupuncture and the rehabilitation training were used. The acupints were Jianyu (LI 15), Binao (LI 14), Jianliao (TE 14), Jianqian (Extra), Quchi (LI 11), Shousanli (LI 10) and Waiguan (TE 5). The rehabilitation training was the same as the observation group. The treatment was given once every day, 6 treatments a week. After 20 treatments, the visual analogue scale (VAS), Fugl-Meyer (FMA) score and Barthel (MBI) score were adopted to evaluate the pain severity, the motor function of the upper limb and the ADL. The clinical therapeutic effects were evaluated in the two groups. RESULTS: The VAS scores were reduced after treatment as compared with those before treatment in the two groups, and FMA and MBI scores were all increased as compared with those before treatment, indicating the significant difference statistically (P<0.05, P<0.01). After treatment, the improvements in the observation group were better than those in the control group (all P<0.05). The curative and remarkably effective rate was 69.8% (37/53) in the observation group, better than 47.2% (25/53) in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The touching-periosteum needling technique of the meridian muscle region theory obviously improves the pain severity, the motor function of the upper limb and the quality of life in patients of post-stroke shoulder pain. The therapeutic effects are better than the routine acupuncture.

29017492|t|Electroacupuncture ameliorating post-stroke cognitive impairments via inhibition of peri-infarct astroglial and microglial/macrophage P2 purinoceptors-mediated neuroinflammation and hyperplasia.
29017492|a|BACKGROUND: During ischemic stroke (IS), adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is released from damaged nerve cells of the infract core region to the extracellular space, invoking peri-infarct glial cellular P2 purinoceptors singling, and causing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, which is likely to initiate or aggravate motor and cognitive impairment. It has been proved that electroacupuncture (EA) is an effective and safe strategy used in anti-inflammation. However, EA for the role of purine receptors in the central nervous system has not yet been reported. METHODS: Ischemia-reperfusion injured rat model was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R). EA treatment at the DU 20 and DU 24 acupoints treatment were conducted to rats from the 12 h after MCAO/R injury for consecutive 7 days. The neurological outcomes, infarction volumes and the level of astroglial and microglial/macrophage hyperplasia, inflammatory cytokine and P2X7R and P2Y1R expression in the peri-infarct hippocampal CA1and sensorimotor cortex were investigated after IS to evaluate the MCAO/R model and therapeutic mechanism of EA treatment. RESULTS: EA effectively reduced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) as evidenced by reduction in astroglial and microglial/macrophage hyperplasia and the levels of P2X7R and ED1, P2X7R and GFAP, P2Y1R and ED1, P2Y1R and GFAP co-expression in peri-infarct hippocampal CA1 and sensorimotor cortex compared with that of MCAO/R model and Non-EA treatment, accompanied by the improved neurological deficit and the motor and memory impairment outcomes. Therefore, our data support the hypothesis that EA could exert its anti-inflammatory effect via inhibiting the astroglial and microglial/macrophage P2 purinoceptors (P2X7R and P2Y1R)-mediated neuroinflammation after MCAO/R injury. CONCLUSION: Astroglial and microglial/macrophage P2 purinoceptors-mediated neuroinflammation and hyperplasia in peri-infarct hippocampal CA1 and sensorimotor cortex were attenuated by EA treatment after ischemic stroke accompanied by the improved motor and memory behavior performance.

29017565|t|Safety and efficacy of Qishen granules in patients with chronic heart failure: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
29017565|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF), the final stage of various cardiovascular diseases, is a major public health problem resulting in significant hospitalization rates, mortality, and huge health care costs despite advances in the treatment and management of heart failure and heart failure-related risk factors. Qishen granules (QSG), a Chinese herbal formula, is widely used by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners to treat CHF. Several animal experimental studies have showed that QSG can significantly relieve the heart failure symptoms in CHF rat models. However, there is as yet no standard clinical trial to confirm this. Thus, the investigators are conducting this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QSG in a large, and varied population. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, double-blind clinical trial with parallel groups. A total of 200 patients with CHF will be recruited and randomly allocated to either the QSG treatment group or the placebo group (in a 1:1 ratio). The patients will receive QSG or placebo granules twice a day for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients in the QSG group, compared with the placebo group, demonstrating a more than 30% decrease in NT-proBNP level during 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes consist of composite cardiac events, New York Heart Association functional classification, 6-minute walking distance, left ventricular ejection fraction, patient quality of life, and the TCM syndrome integral scale. DISCUSSION: On a background of standard treatment, QSG may further reduce the levels of NT-proBNP. This trial will provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy and safety of QSG in treating CHF, thus providing reference for clinical application of QSG. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov: NCT03027375 . Registered on 16 January 2017.

28536255|t|Neuroprotective effect of electroacupuncture and upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α during acute ischaemic stroke in rats.
28536255|a|BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is a traditional method that has been widely used in various fields of medicine with therapeutic effect. However, evidence of effectiveness to support the application of electroacupuncture (EA) during the process of ischaemia is scarce. OBJECTIVES: To investigate dynamic changes in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α expression as well as its association with neurological status in rats subjected to acute ischaemic stroke and EA intervention. METHODS: Forty adult male rats were randomly divided into three groups that received sham surgery (Control group, n=10) or underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion and EA (MCAO+EA group, n=15) or minimal acupuncture as a control treatment (MCAO+MA group, n=15). The rats in the MCAO+EA and MCAO+MA groups received EA or acupuncture without any electrical current, respectively, during 90 min of ischaemia. Rats in the Control group received the same surgical procedure but without MCAO. EA involved electrical stimulation of needles inserted into the quadriceps at 50 Hz frequency and 3 mA current intensity. Neurological status was evaluated on postoperative day 1, and cerebral infarction volume (IV) and HIF-1α expression 24 hours later. RESULTS: Neurological scores were improved and cerebral IV was decreased in the MCAO+EA group compared to the MCAO+MA group (both p<0.05). Moreover, HIF-1α expression was higher in the MCAO+EA group versus the MCAO+MA group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EA enhanced recovery of neurological function, decreased cerebral IV and increased HIF-1α expression in ischaemic rats. Further research is needed to determine whether EA is effective for stroke treatment through the stimulation of muscle contraction.

29103461|t|Neuroprotective effects of Yiqihuoxue calm wind capsule on ischemic stroke in rats.
29103461|a|Stroke remains the third leading cause of death and of adult disability worldwide. Vascular occlusion, followed by ischemic cascade, leads to irreversible tissue injury. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is the only FDA approved drug for the current treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, traditional Chinese medicine has a long history and rich clinical experience in the treatment and rehabilitation of ischemic stroke. Using a classical middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model, we tested the effectiveness of Yiqihuoxue calm wind (YCW) capsule on neurological function, gross pathology and oxidative stress status in MCAO rats. YCW capsule (3.36 and 6.72 g·kg-1 of crude drug) could significantly lower Longa's score and superoxide dismutase (SOD) level, together with less necrotic cells and infarcted area. In addition to elevated MDA and downregulated iNOS expression, YCW capsule exhibited its neuroprotective effects via free radical scavenging and NO inhibition.

28928014|t|Chronic Exposure to Subtherapeutic Antibiotics Aggravates Ischemic Stroke Outcome in Mice.
28928014|a|Subtherapeutic antibiotics have been widely used in agriculture since the 1950s, which can be accumulated in human body through various approaches and may have long-term consequences. However, there is limited information about the link between chronic subtherapeutic antibiotic exposure and the outcome of ischemic brain injury. Here we showed that long-term treatment with subtherapeutic chlortetracycline, penicillin or vancomycin, which were widely used in agriculture approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), could impair EPC functions, reduce ischemic brain angiogenesis and aggravate cerebral ischemic injury and long-term stroke outcomes in mice. In addition, transplantated EPCs from chronic antibiotic-treated mice showed a lower therapeutic effect on cerebral ischemic injury reduction and local angiogenesis promotion compared to those from control mice, and EPCs from the donor animals could integrate into the recipient ischemic brain in mice. Furthermore, transplanted EPCs might exert paracrine effects on cerebral ischemic injury reduction in mice, which could be impaired by chronic antibiotic exposure. In conclusion, chronic subtherapeutic antibiotic exposure aggravated cerebral ischemic injury in mice, which might be partly attributed to the impairment of both EPC-mediated angiogenesis and EPCs' paracrine effects. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized impact of chronic subtherapeutic antibiotic exposure on ischemic injury.

28843178|t|Esculentoside A exerts anti-inflammatory activity in microglial cells.
28843178|a|Esculentoside A (EsA) is a saponin isolated from the roots of Phytolacca esculenta. This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacological effects of EsA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia and primary microglia cells. Our results indicated that EsA pretreatment significantly decreased LPS-induced production of Nitric Oxide (NO) and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and impeded LPS-mediated upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators' expression such as nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α) in both BV2 microglia and primary microglia cells. Moreover, EsA markedly suppressed nuclear factor-κB p65 (NF-κB p65) translocation by blocking IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation in LPS-treated BV2 cells. EsA also decreased phosphorylation level of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and inhibited NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome mediated caspase-1 activation in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. Additionally, EsA decreased β-amyloid1-42 (Aβ1-42)-induced production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in primary microglia. Thus, EsA might be a promising therapeutic agent for alleviating neuroinflammatory diseases.

28857420|t|Single standard substance for the determination of nine volatile components in the distillate of Fructus Gardeniae and Radix Curcumae (an intermediate of Xingnaojing Injection).
28857420|a|Xingnaojing Injection is a traditional Chinese medicine extensively used for stroke and cerebral ischemia. For better in-process quality control of Xingnaojing Injection, a method for the analysis of its intermediate (i.e., the distillate of Fructus Gardeniae and Radix Curcumae) is needed to monitor and optimize the hydrodistillation extraction process. In this work, nine major volatile components in the intermediate were identified: isophorone, 4-methylene-isophorone, curcumenone, curcumenol, curdione, curzerenone, furanodienone, curcumol, and germacrone. A quantitative analysis of multi-component with a single-marker method based on high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of the nine components. In this method, only curdione was needed as the reference substance, and the other eight components were determined using their relative correction factors to curdione. In the method validation, good linearity (r > 0.9999), sensitivity, repeatability, and accuracy (recoveries within 95.3-105.4%) were shown. The repeatability and robustness of the relative correction factors were studied with different column temperatures, flow rates, detection wavelengths, columns, and instruments. In sample analyses, consistent results between the proposed method and the external standard method were shown. The proposed method provides a comprehensive and low-cost tool for the quality assessment of the intermediate of Xingnaojing Injection.

28303450|t|DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment reduces lesion volumes and improves neurological deficits after traumatic brain injury.
28303450|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in severe neurological impairments without effective treatments. Inflammation appears to be an important contributor to key pathogenic events such as secondary brain injury following TBI and therefore serves as a promising target for novel therapies. We have recently demonstrated the ability of a molecular construct comprised of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRα1 domain linked covalently to mouse (m)MOG-35-55 peptide (DRα1-MOG-35-55 construct) to reduce CNS inflammation and tissue injury in animal models of multiple sclerosis and ischemic stroke. The aim of the current study was to determine if DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment of a fluid percussion injury (FPI) mouse model of TBI could reduce the lesion size and improve disease outcome measures. Neurodeficits, lesion size, and immune responses were determined to evaluate the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of neuroprotection induced by DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment. The results demonstrated that daily injections of DRα1-MOG-35-55 given after FPI significantly reduced numbers of infiltrating CD74+ and CD86+ macrophages and increased numbers of CD206+ microglia in the brain concomitant with smaller lesion sizes and improvement in neurodeficits. Conversely, DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment of TBI increased numbers of circulating CD11b+ monocytes and their expression of CD74 but had no detectable effect on cell numbers or marker expression in the spleen. These results demonstrate that DRα1-MOG-35-55 therapy can reduce CNS inflammation and significantly improve histological and clinical outcomes after TBI. Future studies will further examine the potential of DRα1-MOG-35-55 for treatment of TBI.

28743230|t|CART modulates beta-amyloid metabolism-associated enzymes and attenuates memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice.
28743230|a|INTRODUCTION: Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide has been demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects in stroke and some neurodegeneration diseases. In current study, we investigated the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of CART in APP/PS1 mice. METHODS: The protein levels of CART, soluble Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 were measured in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We determined the mRNA and protein levels of Aβ metabolism-associated enzymes including neprilysin (NEP), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice using real-time PCR and western blotting. Spatial memory was measured in APP/PS1 mice using the Morris water maze. The phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, p38, and JNK was determined using western blotting. RESULTS: The levels of soluble Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice after CART treatment. CART modulated the levels of NEP, IDE, RAGE, and LRP-1. In addition, CART inhibited the MAPK pathways and activated the AKT pathway, whereas inhibition of the AKT pathway decreased the levels of IDE and LRP-1. Furthermore, CART attenuated spatial memory deficits in the APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: CART decreases the levels of soluble Aβ in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice by modulating the expression of Aβ metabolism-associated enzymes, which may be associated with the MAPK and AKT pathways.

28476095|t|Effect of transcranial direct current stimulation on swallowing apraxia and cortical excitability in stroke patients.
28476095|a|BACKGROUND: Swallowing apraxia is characterized by impaired volitional swallowing but relatively preserved reflexive swallowing. Few studies are available on the effectiveness of behavioral therapy and management of the condition. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on swallowing apraxia and cortical activation in stroke patients. METHODS: The study included three inpatients (age 48-70 years; 1 male, 2 females; duration of stroke, 35-55 d) with post-stroke swallowing apraxia and six age-matched healthy subjects (age 45-65 years; 3 males, 3 females). Treatments were divided into two phases: Phase A and Phase B. During Phase A, the inpatients received three weeks of sham tDCS and conventional treatments. During Phase B, these patients received three weeks of anodal tDCS over the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex (S1M1) of swallowing and conventional treatments. Swallowing apraxia assessments were measured in three inpatients before Phase A, before Phase B, and after Phase B. The electroencephalography (EEG) nonlinear index of approximate entropy (ApEn) was calculated for three patients and six healthy subjects. RESULTS: After tDCS, scores of swallowing apraxia assessments increased, and ApEn indices increased in both stimulated and non-stimulated areas. CONCLUSIONS: Anodal tDCS might provide a useful means for recovering swallowing apraxia, and the recovery could be related to increased excitability of the swallowing cortex. Further investigations should explore the relationship between lesion size and/or lesion site and the prognosis of swallowing apraxia.

28950851|t|The ameliorative effect of bloodletting puncture at hand twelve Jing-well points on cerebral edema induced by permanent middle cerebral ischemia via protecting the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier.
28950851|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral edema, erupting simultaneously with severe ischemic stroke, might lead to increased intracranial pressure, cerebral herniation, and ultimately death. Studies conducted previously by our team have demonstrated the fact that bloodletting puncture at hand twelve Jing-well points (HTWP) could alleviate cerebral edema, which mainly results from the disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The study, therefore, was first designed to demonstrate whether BBB-protection serves an important role in the edema-relief effect of HTWP bloodletting, based on which to research the molecular mechanism underlying. METHODS: The rats were made into model suffering from permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and then bloodletting puncture were treated at HTWP once a day. Wet and dry weight method was adopted to evaluate the degree of brain edema, evans blue extravasation and electron microscopy were used to evaluate the integrity of the BBB, and RT-qPCR was carried out to analyze the expression level of occludin, claudin-5, ICAM-1, and VEGF. RESULTS: Results revealed that bloodletting puncture treatment could reduce water content of brain and the permeability of BBB caused by ischemic stroke. In bloodletting puncture group, ameliorated tight junctions could be observed under electron microscopy. It was demonstrated in further study that, in bloodletting group, compared with pMCAO one, the expression levels of occludin and claudin-5 were up-regulated, while ICAM-1 and VEGF were down-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, bloodletting puncture at HTWP might play a significant role in protecting the tight junctions of BBB, thus alleviating cerebral edema induced by ischemic stroke. Therefore, the therapy of bloodletting puncture at HTWP may be a promising strategy for acute ischemic stroke in the future.

28932290|t|Moderate- to high-intensity statins for secondary prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on dialysis after acute myocardial infarction.
28932290|a|BACKGROUND: Evidences support the benefits of moderate- to high-intensity statins for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) except for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on dialysis after AMI. This study was aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases using moderate- to high-intensity statins in T2DM patients on dialysis after AMI. METHODS: A simulated prospective cohort study was conducted between January 1st, 2001 and December 31st, 2013 utilizing data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 882 patients with T2DM on dialysis after AMI were selected as the study cohort. Cardiovascular efficacy and safety of moderate- to high-intensity statins were evaluated by comparing outcomes of 441 subjects receiving statins after AMI to 441 matched subjects not receiving statins after AMI. The primary composite outcome included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal ischemic stroke. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier event rate for the primary composite outcomes at 8 years was 30.2% (133 patients) in the statin group compared with 25.2% (111 patients) in the non-statin group (hazard ratio [HR], .98; 95% confidence interval [CI] .76-1.27). Significantly lower risks of non-fatal ischemic stroke (HR, .58; 95% CI .35-.98) and all-cause mortality (HR, .70; 95% CI .59-.84) were found in the statin group. CONCLUSIONS: In T2DM patients on dialysis after AMI, the use of moderate- to high-intensity statins has neutral effects on composite cardiovascular events but may reduce risks of non-fatal ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality.

28915826|t|Acupuncture lowering blood pressure for secondary prevention of stroke: a study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
28915826|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is the prime cause of morbidity and mortality in the general population, and hypertension will increase the recurrence and mortality of stroke. We report a protocol of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) using blood pressure (BP)-lowering acupuncture add-on treatment to treat patients with hypertension and stroke. METHODS: This is a large-scale, multicenter, subject-, assessor- and analyst-blinded, pragmatic RCT. A total of 480 patients with hypertension and ischemic stroke will be randomly assigned to two groups: an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group will receive "HuoXueSanFeng" acupuncture combined with one antihypertensive medication in addition to routine ischemic stroke treatment. The control group will only receive one antihypertensive medication and basic treatments for ischemic stroke. HuoXueSanFeng acupuncture will be given for six sessions weekly for the first 6 weeks and three times weekly for the next 6 weeks. A 9-month follow-up will, thereafter, be conducted. Antihypertensive medication will be adjusted based on BP levels. The primary outcome will be the recurrence of stroke. The secondary outcomes including 24-h ambulatory BP, the TCM syndrome score, the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36), the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), as well as the Barthel Index (BI) scale will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks post initiating treatments; cardiac ultrasound, carotid artery ultrasound, transcranial Doppler, and lower extremity ultrasound will be evaluated at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment. The safety of acupuncture will also be assessed. DISCUSSION: We aim to determine the clinical effects of controlling BP for secondary prevention of stroke with acupuncture add-on treatment.

29354911|t|[Clinical efficacy of electroacupuncture combined with motor imagery therapy on hemiplegic cerebral infarction].
29354911|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) combined with motor imagery therapy on motor function and activity of daily living in patients with hemiplegic cerebral infarction. METHODS: Ninety patients with hemiplegic cerebral infarction were randomly divided into a rehabilitation group, an EA group and a comprehensive group, 30 patients in each one. The patients in the rehabilitation group were treated with regular care, medication and rehabilitation training; based on the rehabilitation group, the patients in the EA group were treated mainly with electroacupuncture at Baihui (GV 20), Dingnieqianxiexian (MS 6), Dingniehouxiexian (MS 7), Jianyu (LI 15), Waiguan (TE 5), Fengshi (GB 31) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6); with the arrival of qi. EA device was connected for 30 min. The patients in the comprehensive group were treated with EA as the EA group and motor imagery therapy, 20 min per treatment. The treatment was given once a day, five treatments per week, and totally 4-week treatment was performed. The Barthel index and Brunnstrom score before and after treatment were observed in the three groups. RESULTS: Three cases did not finish the trial and finally 87 cases were included into analysis, including 30 cases in the rehabilitation group, 29 cases in the EA group and 28 cases in the comprehensive group. Compared before treatment, the Barthel index and Brunnstrom score were significantly improved after treatment in the three groups (all P<0.01); after treatment, the Barthel index in the EA group and comprehensive group was significantly higher than that in the rehabilitation group (both P<0.01); the lower extremity score of Brunnstrom score in the comprehensive group was better than those in the EA group and rehabilitation group (both P<0.05). CONCLUSION: EA combined with motor imagery therapy and rehabilitation can significantly improve the motor function and activity of daily living in patients with hemiplegic cerebral infarction, which is superior to rehabilitation alone or EA alone.

29354909|t|[Post-stroke unilateral spatial neglect treated with acupuncture and rehabilitation: a randomized controlled trial].
29354909|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the impacts on post-stroke unilateral spatial neglect treated with acupuncture for "regaining consciousness, benefiting marrow and opening orifices" and rehabilitation. METHODS: Forty patients of post-stroke unilateral spatial neglect were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 20 cases in each one. In the observation group, acupuncture was applied to the acupoints for "regaining consciousness, benefiting marrow and opening orifices", named Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Benshen (GB 13), Shenting (GV 24), and the bilateral yuan-primary points and luo-connecting points of the heart meridian, pericardium meridian and kidney meridian, as well as the acupoints along the affected meridians. Additionally, the rehabilitation was provided. In the control group, acupuncture at the acupoints along the affected meridians and rehabilitation were adopted. The treatment was given once a day, 5 times a week. After 8 weeks of treatment the evaluation was made. the indexes of unilateral spatial neglect such as line bisection test, the score of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the score of simple Fugl-Meyer motor function assessment and the modified Barthel indexes were adopted for the assessment of the severity of unilateral spatial neglect, cognitive function, motor function, and the activities of daily living. RESULTS: After treatment, the indexes of unilateral spatial neglect (line bisection test, line cancellation test, clock-drawing test and copying drawing test), MMSE score, the simple Fugl-Meyer motor function assessment and modified Barthel indexes were all improved as compared with those before treatment in the two groups (all P<0.01). The improvements in the observation group were more obvious than those in the control group (P<0.05, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The combination of acupuncture treatment for "regaining consciousness, benefiting marrow and opening orifices" and rehabilitation much more effectively alleviates the severity of post-stroke unilateral spatial neglect and improves the motor function and the activities of daily living in the patients.

28880896|a|Cerebral stroke is a leading cause of death and permanent disability. The current therapeutic outcome of ischemic stroke (>85% of all strokes) is very poor, thus novel therapeutic drug is urgently needed. In vitro cell model of ischemia was established by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and in vivo animal model of ischemia was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The effects of Spatholobus suberctus Dunn extract (SSCE) on OGD-induced cell injury, MCAO-induced neural injury and miR-494 level were all evaluated. The possible target genes were virtually screened utilizing bioinformatics and verified by luciferase assay. Subsequently, the effects of abnormally expressed miR-494 on OGD-induced cell injury and target gene expression were determined. Additionally, whether SSCE affected target gene expression through modulation of miR-494 was studied. Finally, the effects of aberrantly expressed Sox8 on OGD-induced injury and signaling pathways were estimated. SSCE reduced OGD-induced cell injury and ameliorated MCAO-induced neuronal injury, along with down-regulation of miR-494. Then, OGD-induced cell injury was increased by miR-494 overexpression but decreased by miR-494 silence. Sox8 was a target gene of miR-494, and SSCE could up-regulate Sox8 expression via down-regulating miR-494. Afterwards, OGD-induced cell injury was proved to be increased by Sox8 inhibition but reduced by Sox8 overexpression. Finally, OGD-induced inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways was further inhibited by Sox8 silence but activated by Sox8 overexpression. SSCE ameliorates ischemia-induced injury both in vitro and in vivo by miR-494-mediated modulation of Sox8, involving activations of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways.

28873081|t|Impact of Tag Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in CCL11 Gene on Risk of Subtypes of Ischemic Stroke in Xinjiang Han Populations.
28873081|a|BACKGROUND CCL11 is an important inflammatory cytokine associated with inflammation-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between CCL11 gene polymorphism with subtypes of ischemic stroke in Xinjiang Han populations. MATERIAL AND METHODS The improved multiple ligase detection reaction (iMLDR) method was used to analyze the genotypes of 6 tag SNPs in the CCL11 gene (rs1129844, rs17809012, rs1860183, rs1860184, rs4795898, and rs4795895) in a case-control study of 406 lacunar stroke patients, 214 large-artery atherosclerotic (LAA) stroke patients, and 425 controls. RESULTS We found the GG genotype of rs4795895 was significantly associated with increased risk of lacunar stroke (adjusted OR=1.676, 95%CI=1.117-2.515), and the GA genotype of rs17809012 was associated with a significant increase in risk of LAA stroke (adjusted OR=1.337, 95%CI=1.127-1.585). Hypertension stratification analyses showed that the GA genotype of rs17809012 was significantly associated with LAA stroke in the hypertensive group (adjusted OR=1.274, 95%CI=1.015-1.601). In the non-hypertensive group, the GA genotype of rs17809012 was significantly associated with LAA stroke (adjusted OR=1.361, 95%CI=1.041-1.780). The GG genotype of rs4795895 (adjusted OR=1.147, 95%CI=1.115-4.134) and the TT genotype of rs1860184 were significantly associated with lacunar stroke (adjusted OR=2.440, 95%CI=1.550-3.840). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that the CCL11 gene could play an important role in the pathogenesis of lacunar stroke and LAA stroke in the Han population of China.

28840832|t|Torenia concolor Lindley var. formosana Yamazaki extracts improve inflammatory response and lipid accumulation via PPARs activation.
28840832|a|Background/Introduction: At present, human diet is replete with sugar and fat. Abnormal metabolism and hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia in the body induces the development of an overactive and continuous inflammatory response, resulting in obesity and metabolic syndromes, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Torenia concolor Lindley var. formosana Yamazaki (TC), a perennial creeping herbaceous plant, is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb widely used for the treatment of heat stroke, aching muscles and bones, cold, dysentery, and ambustion.PURPOSE: This study evaluated the influence of TC on inflammation responses and lipid metabolism. METHODS: In this study, ground TC powder was extracted with 95% ethanol. The ethanol was removed by vacuum concentration, and the resulting extract was further extracted with a number of solvents of different polarity to produce four final extracts: an ethanol extract (TCEE), an ethyl acetate extract (TCEAE), an n-butanol extract (TCBUE), and a water extract (TCWE). The anti-inflammatory efficacy of the extracts and their capability for lipid metabolism regulation was then explored. RESULTS: TCEE, TCEAE, and TCBUE exhibited good anti-inflammatory efficacy; TCEAE also simultaneously regulated lipid metabolism. In RAW264.7 cells, these three extracts suppressed the expression of iNOS and IL-6 via the signaling pathway activation of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and thereby showed anti-inflammatory efficacy. In 3T3-L1 cells, these three extracts promoted lipid metabolism and reduced lipid accumulation through the activation of PPARα and the increased expression of adiponectin, thus demonstrating regulation of lipid metabolism. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that TC possesses anti-inflammatory efficacy and can regulate lipid metabolism through the activation of transcription factor PPARs. We speculate that these nutraceutical effects are attributable to betulin, an active ingredient in this herbal medicine.

28962104|t|Altered functional connectivity in patients with post-stroke memory impairment: A resting fMRI study.
28962104|a|Post-stroke memory dysfunction (PMD) is one of the most common forms of cognitive impairment among stroke survivors. However, only a limited number of studies have directly investigated the neural mechanisms associated with memory decline. The aim of the present study was to identify dynamic changes in the functional organization of the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network of patients with PMD. A total of 27 patients with PMD who experienced a stroke in the right hemisphere were enrolled in the current study, along with 27 healthy control subjects matched by age, sex, and educational level. A behavioral examination and functional magnetic resonance imaging scan were performed. The data were analyzed using an independent component analysis method. The results revealed a significantly increased functional connectivity between the DMN and prefrontal cortex (left middle/inferior frontal and left precentral gyri), temporal regions (left superior temporal gyrus), and bilateral and posterior cingulate gyri/precuneus (P<0.001). There was also a significantly decreased functional connectivity between the DMN and right middle temporal gyrus, left uvula, and right inferior parietal lobule, and between the dorsal attention network and prefrontal cortex (left precentral/inferior and right inferior/middle frontal gyri), right inferior parietal gyrus, and right insula (P<0.001). These results suggest that the stroke affected both the lesioned and contralesional hemispheres. The prefrontal cortex, temporal regions, insula, and posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus serve a crucial role in memory processing.

28500428|t|A novel classification method for aid decision of traditional Chinese patent medicines for stroke treatment.
28500428|a|Traditional Chinese patent medicines are widely used to treat stroke because it has good efficacy in the clinical environment. However, because of the lack of knowledge on traditional Chinese patent medicines, many Western physicians, who are accountable for the majority of clinical prescriptions for such medicine, are confused with the use of traditional Chinese patent medicines. Therefore, the aid-decision method is critical and necessary to help Western physicians rationally use traditional Chinese patent medicines. In this paper, Manifold Ranking is employed to develop the aid-decision model of traditional Chinese patent medicines for stroke treatment. First, 115 stroke patients from three hospitals are recruited in the cross-sectional survey. Simultaneously, traditional Chinese physicians determine the traditional Chinese patent medicines appropriate for each patient. Second, particular indicators are explored to characterize the population feature of traditional Chinese patent medicines for stroke treatment. Moreover, these particular indicators can be easily obtained byWestern physicians and are feasible for widespread clinical application in the future. Third, the aid-decision model of traditional Chinese patent medicines for stroke treatment is constructed based on Manifold Ranking. Experimental results reveal that traditional Chinese patent medicines can be differentiated. Moreover, the proposed model can obtain high accuracy of aid decision.

28713979|t|Roles of electro-acupuncture in glucose metabolism as assessed by 18F-FDG/PET imaging and AMPKα phosphorylation in rats with ischemic stroke.
28713979|a|Targeted energy metabolism balance contributes to neural survival during ischemic stroke. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that electro‑acupuncture (EA) can enhance cerebral glucose metabolism assessed by 18F‑fluorodeoxyglucose/positron emission tomography (18F‑FDG/PET) imaging to prevent propagation of tissue damage and improve neurological outcome in rats subjected to ischemia and reperfusion injury. Rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and received EA treatment at the LI11 and ST36 acupoints or non‑acupoint treatment once a day for 7 days. After EA treatment, a significant reduction in the infarct volume was determined by T2‑weighted imaging, accompanied by the functional recovery in CatWalk and Rota-rod performance. Moreover, EA promoted higher glucose metabolism in the caudate putamen (CPu), motor cortex (MCTX), somatosensory cortex (SCTX) regions as assessed by animal 18F‑FDG/PET imaging, suggesting that three‑brain regional neural activity was enhanced by EA. In addition, the AMP‑activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) in the CPu, MCTX and SCTX regions was phosphorylated at threonine 172 (Thr172) after ischemic injury; however, phosphorylation of AMPK was further increased by EA. These results indicate that EA could promote AMPKα phosphorylation of the CPu, MCTX and SCTX regions to enhance neural activity and motor functional recovery after ischemic stroke.

27982773|t|Effect of combined VEGF165/ SDF-1 gene therapy on vascular remodeling and blood perfusion in cerebral ischemia.
27982773|a|OBJECTIVE Therapeutic neovascularization is a promising strategy for treating patients after an ischemic stroke; however, single-factor therapy has limitations. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins synergistically promote angiogenesis. In this study, the authors assessed the effect of combined gene therapy with VEGF165 and SDF-1 in a rat model of cerebral infarction. METHODS An adenoviral vector expressing VEGF165 and SDF-1 connected via an internal ribosome entry site was constructed (Ad- VEGF165-SDF-1). A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established; either Ad- VEGF165-SDF-1 or control adenovirus Ad- LacZ was stereotactically microinjected into the lateral ventricle of 80 rats 24 hours after MCAO. Coexpression and distribution of VEGF165 and SDF-1 were examined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The neurological severity score of each rat was measured on Days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after MCAO. Angiogenesis and vascular remodeling were evaluated via bromodeoxyuridine and CD34 immunofluorescence labeling. Relative cerebral infarction volumes were determined by T2-weighted MRI and triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Cerebral blood flow, relative cerebral blood volume, and relative mean transmit time were assessed using perfusion-weighted MRI. RESULTS The Ad- VEGF165-SDF-1 vector mediated coexpression of VEGF165 and SDF-1 in multiple sites around the ischemic core, including the cortex, corpus striatum, and hippocampal granular layer. Coexpression of VEGF165 and SDF-1 improved neural function, reduced cerebral infarction volume, increased microvascular density and promoted angiogenesis in the ischemic penumbra, and improved cerebral blood flow and perfusion. CONCLUSIONS Combined VEGF165 and SDF-1 gene therapy represents a potential strategy for improving vascular remodeling and recovery of neural function after cerebral infarction.

28687422|t|Resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analysis of Brain Functional Activity in Rats with Ischemic Stroke Treated by Electro-acupuncture.
28687422|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether electro-acupuncture (EA) treatment at acupoints of Zusanli (ST 36) and Quchi (LI 11) could reduce motor impairments and enhance brain functional recovery in rats with ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established. EA at ST 36 and LI 11was started at 24 hours (MCAO + EA group) after ischemic stroke. The nontreatment (MCAO) and sham-operated control (SC) groups were included as controls. The neurologic deficits of all groups were assessed by Zea Longa scores and the modified neurologic severity scores on 24 hours and 8 days after MCAO. To further investigate the effect of EA on infract volume and brain function, magnetic resonance imaging was used to estimate the brain lesion and brain neural activities of each group at 8 days after ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Within 1 week after EA treatment, the neurologic deficits were significantly alleviated, and the cerebral infarctions were improved, including visual cortex, motor cortex, striatum, dorsal thalamus, and hippocampus. Furthermore, whole brain neural activities of auditory cortex, lateral nucleus group of dorsal thalamus, hippocampus, motor cortex, orbital cortex, sensory cortex, and striatum were decreased in MCAO group, whereas that of brain neural activities were increased after EA treatment, suggesting these brain regions are in accordance with the brain structure analysis. CONCLUSION: EA at ST 36 and LI 11 could enhance the neural activity of motor function-related brain regions, including motor cortex, dorsal thalamus, and striatum in rats, which is a potential treatment for ischemia stroke.

29089989|t|Constraint-induced movement therapy in treatment of acute and sub-acute stroke: a meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials.
29089989|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of constraint-induced movement therapy in acute and sub-acute stroke. DATA SOURCES: The key words were stroke, cerebrovascular accident, constraint-induced therapy, forced use, and randomized controlled trial. The databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, Weipu Information Resources System, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were searched for studies on randomized controlled trials for treating acute or sub-acute stroke published before March 2016. DATA SELECTION: We retrieved relevant randomized controlled trials that compared constraint-induced movement therapy in treatment of acute or sub-acute stroke with traditional rehabilitation therapy (traditional occupational therapy). Patients were older than 18 years, had disease courses less than 6 months, and were evaluated with at least one upper extremity function scale. Study quality was evaluated, and data that met the criteria were extracted. Stata 11.0 software was used for the meta-analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of the arm, the action research-arm test, a motor activity log for amount of use and quality of movement, the Wolf motor function test, and a modified Barthel index. RESULTS: A total of 16 prospective randomized controlled trials (379 patients in the constraint-induced movement-therapy group and 359 in the control group) met inclusion criteria. Analysis showed significant mean differences in favor of constraint-induced movement therapy for the Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of the arm (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 10.822; 95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 7.419-14.226), the action research-arm test (WMD = 10.718; 95% CI: 5.704-15.733), the motor activity log for amount of use and quality of movement (WMD = 0.812; 95% CI: 0.331-1.293) and the modified Barthel index (WMD = 10.706; 95% CI: 4.417-16.966). CONCLUSION: Constraint-induced movement therapy may be more beneficial than traditional rehabilitation therapy for improving upper limb function after acute or sub-acute stroke.

28936956|t|[Epidemiology characteristics of crawfish related rhabdomyolysis in Nanjing, 2016: a multicenter retrospective investigation].
28936956|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology characteristics of crawfish related rhabdomyolysis (RM) in Nanjing, 2016. METHODS: Outpatient and inpatient electronic medical system of 21 hospitals in Nanjing during 2016 were retrospectively searched, and all the patients diagnosed with RM were selected. The patients with none crayfish-related RM was excluded. The epidemiology characteristics were depicted. The geographic information system (GIS) was used to collect, manage and analyze the spatial data, to visualize it, to analyze the spatial distribution features of the disease, and to explore the cause of disease prediction. GeoDa 1.8 software was used to analyze the global and local spatial auto-correlation. RESULTS: A total of 1 183 patients with crawfish related RM were initially screened, excluding 59 patients with RM caused by trauma, severe exercise, heat stroke, myositis, poisoning, drugs, and genetic diseases, and 1 124 patients were enrolled. The proportion of men was 36.48% (410/1 124) with an incidence of 12.54/100 thousands; while of women was 63.52% (714/1 124) with an incidence of 21.86/100 thousands. The median age at onset was 34 (28, 43) years. From July to August, the incidence of crawfish related RM was the highest, accounting for 96.53% of the total number of cases. The top four incidence areas were Pukou (41.54/100 thousands), Jianye (25.94/100 thousands), Qixia (25.73/100 thousands), Gulou (25.04/100 thousands), all of which were adjacent to the Yangtze River. Global spatial autocorrelation analysis showed: Moran I = 0.427, Z = 2.646, P = 0.003, suggesting that the crawfish related RM had positive spatial autocorrelation. The results showed that the spatial structure of crawfish related RM existed in Nanjing in 2016. Local spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that the "high-high" concentration areas were Pukou, Jianye and Liuhe. The incidences of above three areas which were the Nanjing section of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River flowed through the region and surrounding areas were higher than the overall incidence of Nanjing. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of crawfish related RM in Nanjing during 2016 had an obvious region-concentrated character and global spatial autocorrelation with the high prevalent regions mainly concentrated in the urban areas adjacent to the Yangtze River.

28912716|t|A Meta-Analysis of Folic Acid in Combination with Anti-Hypertension Drugs in Patients with Hypertension and Hyperhomocysteinemia.
28912716|a|Folic acid is generally used to lower homocysteine concentrations and prevent stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD) at present. However, the efficacy of therapies that lower homocysteine concentrations in reducing the risk of CVD and stroke remains controversial. Our objective was to do a meta-analysis of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of folic acid supplementation among patients with hypertension and Hyperhomocysteinemia (HT/HHcy). We included RCTs examining the effects of folic acid plus antihypertensive therapy compared to antihypertensive alone. Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) and Relative risk (RR) were used as a measure of the effect of folic acid on the outcome measures with a random effect model. Sixty-five studies including 7887 patients met all inclusion criteria. Among them, 49 trials reported significant effect of combination therapy for reducing SBP (systolic Blood Pressure) and DBP (Diastolic Blood Pressure) levels compared with antihypertensive alone (WMD = -7.85, WMD = -6.77, respectively). Meanwhile, folic acid supplementation apparently reduced the level of total homocysteine (WMD = 5.5). In addition, folic acid supplementation obviously reduced the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (CVCE) by 12.9% compared with control groups. In terms of the stratified analyses, a bigger beneficial effect was seen in those RCTs with treatment duration of more than 12 weeks, a decrease in the concentration of total homocysteine of more than 25%, with folic acid fortification. Our findings indicated that folic acid supplementation was effective in the primary prevention of CVCE among HT/HHcy patients, as well as reducing the blood pressure and total homocysteine levels.

28919704|t|Secondary prevention of major cerebrovascular events with seven different statins: a multi-treatment meta-analysis.
28919704|a|BACKGROUND: Statins have been recommended for the use in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, but different statins have distinct pharmacological characteristics. This multi-treatment meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of seven statins in the secondary prevention of major cerebrovascular events (CVEs). METHODS AND ANALYSES: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to identify studies published between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2016. The included randomized controlled trials investigated the efficacy of lovastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin or rosuvastatin in the secondary prevention of CVEs. The primary outcomes were CVEs; the secondary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal stroke and nonfatal stroke. Meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were used for data synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 42 studies with 82,601 patients were included for analysis. In the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, the major CVEs in pravastatin (risk ratio [RR] 0.87, 0.76-0.99)- and atorvastatin (RR 0.59, 0.49-0.72)-treated patients reduced significantly compared with controls. Indirect comparisons with network meta-analysis showed that RR was 0.60 (0.40-0.92) for atorvastatin compared with rosuvastatin. Compared to controls, the all-cause death was reduced by 12% in statins-treated patients (RR 0.88, 0.81-0.96). Indirect comparisons with network analysis showed a significant difference in the nonfatal stroke between fluvastatin-treated patients and lovastatin-treated patients (RR 0.28, 0.07-0.95). CONCLUSION: Different statins have distinct pharmacological characteristics, and there are differences in statistical and clinical outcomes among several statins.

28912713|t|Meta-Analysis for Clinical Evaluation of Xingnaojing Injection for the Treatment of Cerebral Infarction.
28912713|a|Objective: Xingnaojing injection (XNJ) is derived from An-Gong-Niu-Huang pill, a well-known traditional Chinese patent medicine, which is widely used for stroke. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of XNJ on cerebral infarction, an extensive meta-analysis was used. Methods: Six major electronic databases including the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Wanfang, the VIP medicine information system (VMIS) and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were examined to retrieve randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of XNJ in treating CI before November 26, 2016. Results: There were 53 randomized controlled trials with 4915 participants in this study. The results reflected that compared with the conventional therapy (CT) alone, XNJ could significantly improve the overall response rate (OR = 3.56, 95% CI [2.94, 4.32], P < 0.00001), and clinical symptom (including increasing activities of daily living (ADL, MD = 10.23, 95% CI [9.47, 10.99], P < 0.00001), and reduce infarction size (MD = -1.83, 95% CI [-2.49, -1.16], P < 0.00001)). However, there was no significant difference between the XNJ treatment and conventional therapy in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS, P = 0.32). Neurological deficit score demonstrated that XNJ could significantly reduce the score in two different evaluation criterions as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS, MD = -3.44, 95% CI [-4.52, -2.36], P < 0.00001), and the Chinese Stroke Scale (CSS, MD = -5.72, 95% CI [-6.94, -4.50], P < 0.00001). Additionally, serum MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly reduced by XNJ treatment compared with conventional therapy (MD = -11.24, 95% CI [-20.83, -1.65], P = 0.02; MD = -25.08, 95% CI [-35.49, -14.67], P < 0.00001, respectively). Moreover, XNJ was able to improve hemorrheology in reducing whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, and hematocrit (MD = -1.44, 95% CI [-2.18, 0.70], P = 0.001; MD = -0.22, 95% CI [-0.37, -0.07], P = 0.003; MD = -3.63, 95% CI [-6.23, -1.03], P = 0.006, respectively). The therapeutic efficacy of XNJ was found associated with improving hemodynamics (increasing peak-flow rate, and average velocity) (MD = 12.66, 95% CI [10.50, 14.81], P < 0.00001; MD = 9.90, 95% CI [8.63, 11.17], P < 0.00001). XNJ was also related to reducing cholesterol and triglyceride (MD = -1.06, 95% CI [-1.21, -0.92], P < 0.00001; MD = -1.05, 95% CI [-1.12, -0.97], P < 0.00001). Conclusion: Despite the sample size and the poor quality of the included studies of this review, the results of the research showed that XNJ might be a beneficial therapeutic method for the treatment of cerebral infarction.

28814273|t|Add-on neurological benefits of antiviral therapy in HCV patients with chronic kidney disease - a nationwide cohort study.
28814273|a|BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have rarely been studied because they rarely accept interferon-based therapy (IBT) and have been difficult to follow up. We investigated long-term outcomes of IBT on the population. METHODS: This population-based cohort study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database as its data source. HCV patients diagnosed with CKD between Jan. 1, 2003, and Dec. 31, 2013, were selected. They were then divided into two groups based on whether they had undergone IBT. All-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic stroke (IS), hemorrhagic stroke, and new-onset dialysis were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis after propensity score matching. RESULTS: We enrolled 9872 HCV patients with CKD: 1684 patients in the treated cohort and 8188 patients in the untreated cohort. The annual incidence of all-cause mortality (19.00 vs. 42.89 events per 1000 person-years; p < 0.001) and the incidences of hemorrhagic stroke (1.21 vs. 4.19 events per 1000 person-years; p = 0.006) were lower in the treated cohort. New-onset dialysis was also lower in the treated cohort (aHR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.20-0.48; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Antiviral therapy might provide protective benefits on all-cause mortality, hemorrhagic stroke, and new-onset dialysis in HCV-infected patients with CKD.

28388366|t|Ellagic acid protects against neuron damage in ischemic stroke through regulating the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax expression.
28388366|a|An oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation model in primary cultured rat cortical neurons was developed for this study to investigate the effects of ellagic acid (EA), a low-molecular-weight polyphenol, on neuron cells and their function, and to evaluate whether EA can be safely utilized by humans as a functional food or therapeutic agent. Administration of EA significantly decreased the volume of cerebrum infarction and the neurological deficit scores of the rats; EA treatment also increased the number of Bcl-2-positive cells and the ratio of Bcl-2-positive to Bax-positive neurons in the semidarkness zone near the brain ischemic focus in the photothrombotic cerebral ischemia model. Treatment of EA resulted in increased neuron viability, cell nuclear integrity, and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax expression in the primary cultured neuron model; EA treatment also lead to a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells. Our results therefore suggest a specific mechanism for the beneficial effects of EA, providing new insights into how it provides neuroprotection. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent new insights on the mechanisms of the brain cell protective activity of EA. Thus, EA may be used in functional foods or medicines to help treat nerve dysfunction, neurodegenerative disease, and aging.

28939023|t|Vascular protective effects of aqueous extracts of Tribulus terrestris on hypertensive endothelial injury.
28939023|a|Angiotensin II (Ang II) is involved in endothelium injury during the development of hypertension. Tribulus terrestris (TT) is used to treat hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and post-stroke syndrome in China. The present study aimed to determine the effects of aqueous TT extracts on endothelial injury in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and its protective effects against Ang II-induced injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). SHRs were administered intragastrically with TT (17.2 or 8.6 g·kg-1·d-1) for 6 weeks, using valsartan (13.5 mg·kg-1·d-1) as positive control. Blood pressure, heart rate, endothelial morphology of the thoracic aorta, serum levels of Ang II, endothelin-1 (ET-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malonaldehyde (MDA) were measured. The endothelial injury of HUVECs was induced by 2 × 10-6 mol·L-1 Ang II. Cell Apoptosisapoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), ET-1, SOD, and MDA in the cell culture supernatant and cell migration were assayed. The expression of hypertension-linked genes and proteins were analyzed. TT decreased systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure and heart rate, improved endothelial integrity of thoracic aorta, and decreased serum leptin, Ang II, ET-1, NPY, and Hcy, while increased NO in SHRs. TT suppressed Ang II-induced HUVEC proliferation and apoptosis and prolonged the survival, and increased cell migration. TT regulated the ROS, and decreased mRNA expression of Akt1, JAK2, PI3Kα, Erk2, FAK, and NF-κB p65 and protein expression of Erk2, FAK, and NF-κB p65. In conclusion, TT demonstrated anti-hypertensive and endothelial protective effects by regulating Erk2, FAK and NF-κB p65.

28453191|t|Naringenin prevents ischaemic stroke damage via anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant effects.
28453191|a|Apoptosis and oxidative stress are considered to be the major factors associated with the development and progression of many ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases. Naringenin (NAR) is an abundant flavanone in citrus plants and has been found to exhibit anti-oxidant, anti-carcinogenic and anti-apoptotic effects. This study aimed to investigate the anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant effects of naringenin on ischaemic stroke. In vitro, cortical neuron cells isolated from the brains of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/Rep), NAR-L, NAR-M and NAR-H groups. MTT and RT-PCR were used for cell proliferation and apoptosis-related proteins analyses. The effects of NAR on the Nrf2 signalling pathway were investigated using transfection approaches. Differences in mitochondrial dysfunction were analyzed by flow cytometry. In vivo, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was prepared and neurological defects and the brain wet/dry (W/D) ratio were assessed and recorded; apoptosis was measured based on the TUNEL assay. Additionally, biochemical indices were detected both in vitro and in vivo. NAR promoted cortical neuron cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and oxidative stress, and regulated the localization of Nrf2 protein (P<.05). Furthermore, silencing and overexpression of Nrf2 affected cortical neuron cell proliferation and apoptosis (P<.05). In vivo, NAR could alleviate cerebral oedema, improve neurological defects, and reduce apoptosis and oxidative stress (P<.05). These findings demonstrated that NAR could reduce apoptosis and oxidative stress and that Nrf2 signalling pathway is involved in this regulatory process. NAR has health-promoting properties because of its anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant effects in cases of ischaemic stroke.

28779941|t|Effects of motor imagery on walking function and balance in patients after stroke: A quantitative synthesis of randomized controlled trials.
28779941|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of motor imagery (MI) on walking function and balance in patients after stroke. METHODS: Related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched in 12 electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, WanFang, and VIP) from inception to November 30, 2016, and Review Manager 5.3 was used for meta-analysis. References listed in included papers and other related systematic reviews on MI were also screened for further consideration. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies were included. When compared with "routine methods of treatment or training", meta-analyses showed that MI was more effective in improving walking abilities (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.69, random effect model, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38 to 1.00, P < 0.0001) and motor function in stroke patients (SMD = 0.84, random effect model, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.22, P < 0.0001), but no statistical difference was noted in balance (SMD = 0.81, random effect model, 95% CI = -0.03 to 1.65, P = 0.06). Statistically significant improvement in walking abilities was noted at short-term (0 to < six weeks) (SMD = 0.83, fixed effect model, 95% CI = 0.24 to 1.42, P = 0.006) and long-term (≥six weeks) assessments (SMD = 0.45, fixed effect model, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.64, P < 0.00001). Subgroup analyses suggested that MI had a positive effect on balance with short-term duration (0 to < six weeks) (SMD = 4.67, fixed effect model, 95% CI = 2.89 to 6.46, P < 0.00001), but failed to improve balance (SMD = 0.82, random effect model, 95% CI = -0.27 to 1.90, P = 0.14) with long-term (≥six weeks) duration. CONCLUSION: MI appears to be a beneficial intervention for stroke rehabilitation. Nonetheless, existing evidence regarding the effects of MI in patients after stroke remains inconclusive because of significantly statistical heterogeneity and methodological flaws identified in the included studies. More large-scale and rigorously designed RCTs in future research with sufficient follow-up periods are needed to provide more reliable evidence on the effects of MI in post-stroke patients.

28735831|t|Wenxin Keli for Ventricular premature complexes with Heart failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.
28735831|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Wenxin Keli (WXKL) alone or combined with Western medicine in treating ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) with heart failure (HF). METHODS: We searched five databases to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before May 2016. Two review authors independently searched and screened the literature, extracted the data as well as assessed the methodological quality of the included studies by using criteria from the Cochrane Handbook, and analyzed via using Review Manager 5.3 software. RESULTS: Eight studies of WXKL were included. The results of the Meta-analysis showed that WXKL was more significant on the frequency of VPCs (MD=-427.08, 95% CI: -526.73∼-327.43, P<0.01), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (MD=-4.12, 95% CI: 2.97∼5.27, P<0.01), the total effect of VPCs (RR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.34∼0.69, P<0.01) and 6-min walking test (MD=28.05, 95% CI: 19.56∼36.54, P<0.01). The treatment group presented a significant reduction at left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVED) (MD=-3.94, 95% CI: -6.57∼-1.31, P<0.01) when treatment time was 12 weeks, however, there was no statistical difference at 8 weeks. In addition, the included trials generally showed low methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: Wenxin Keli may be effective and safe for treating VPCs and HF. However, further RCTs of larger scale, multi-center/country, longer follow-up periods, and higher quality are still required to verify the efficacy of Wenxin Keli in ventricular premature beat with heart failure.

28810574|t|Tissue kallikrein protects against ischemic stroke by suppressing TLR4/NF-κB and activating Nrf2 signaling pathway in rats.
28810574|a|Brain damage following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a complicated pathophysiological course, in which inflammation and oxidative stress have been suggested to serve an important role. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been suggested to be involved in secondary inflammatory process in cerebral ischemia. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), an important regulator of the antioxidant host defense, maintains the cellular redox homeostasis. Tissue kallikrein (TK) has been proven to elicit a variety of biological effects in ischemic stroke through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. However, the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects remain poorly defined. The present study examined the hypothesis that TK attenuates ischemic cerebral injury via the TLR4/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and Nrf2 signaling pathways. Using a transient rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, the effects of immediate and delayed TK treatment subsequent to reperfusion were investigated. The neurological deficits, infarct size, and the expression of TLR4/NF-κB and Nrf2 pathway in ischemic brain tissues were measured at 24 following MCAO. The results indicated that TK immediate treatment significantly improved neurological deficits and reduced the infarct size, accompanied by the inhibition of TLR4 and NF-κB levels, and the activation of Nrf2 pathway. Furthermore, TK delayed treatment also exerted neuroprotection against I/R injury. However, the neuroprotective effect of TK immediate treatment was better compared with that of TK delayed treatment. In conclusion, the results indicated that TK protected the brain against ischemic injury in rats after MCAO through its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Suppression of TLR4/NF-κB and activation of the Nrf2 pathway contributed to the neuroprotective effects induced by TK in cerebral ischemia. Therefore, TK may provide an effective intervention with a wider therapeutic window for ischemic stroke.

28810542|t|Electroacupuncture promotes axonal regeneration in rats with focal cerebral ischemia through the downregulation of Nogo-A/NgR/RhoA/ROCK signaling.
28810542|a|The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the axonal regeneration environment following cerebral ischemia injury and to investigate whether it was associated with Nogo-A/Nogo receptor (NgR)/RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling. Using a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia, the effects of EA at the Quchi (LI11) and Zusanli (ST36) acupoints on axonal growth inhibitory protein and axonal growth factors were assessed and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. It was found that EA at the Quchi and Zusanli acupoints significantly improved neurological deficit scores following ischemia (P<0.05), and reduced the cerebral infarct volume. Moreover, it was demonstrated that crucial signaling molecules in the Nogo-A signaling pathway were regulated by EA. These results suggest that EA provides a less inhibitory environment for axonal regeneration following cerebral ischemia through inhibition of Nogo-A/NgR/RhoA/ROCK signaling.

28478514|t|Salidroside Inhibits Inflammation Through PI3K/Akt/HIF Signaling After Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Rats.
28478514|a|Salidroside is being investigated for its therapeutic potential in stroke because it is neuroprotective over an extended therapeutic window of time. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of salidroside (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) in rats, given 1 h after reperfusion of a middle cerebral artery that had been occluded for 2 h. After 24 h, we found that salidroside increased the neuronal nuclear protein NeuN and reduced the marker of microglia and macrophages CD11b in the peri-infarct area of the brain. Salidroside also decreased IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, CD14, CD44, and iNOs mRNAs. At the same time, salidroside increased the ratio of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) to total Akt. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 prevented this increase in p-Akt and reversed the inhibitory effects of salidroside on CD11b and inflammatory mediators. Salidroside also elevated the protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) subunits HIF1α, HIF2α, HIF3α, and of erythropoietin (EPO). The stimulatory effects of salidroside on HIFα subunits were blocked by LY294002. Moreover, YC-1, a HIF inhibitor, abolished salidroside-mediated increase of HIF1α and prevented the inhibitory effects of salidroside on CD11b and inflammatory mediators. Taken together, our results provide evidence for the first time that all three HIFα subunits and EPO can be regulated by PI3K/Akt in cerebral tissue, and that salidroside entrains this signaling pathway to induce production of HIFα subunits and EPO, one or more of which mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of salidroside after cerebral IRI.

28796050|t|Dengzhanxixin injection for cerebral infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
28796050|a|BACKGROUND: No systematic review has been published in English of Dengzhanxixin (DZXX) injection for cerebral infarction. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects and safety of DZXX injection for cerebral infarction. METHODS: Eight databases were searched from their inception. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to DZXX for cerebral infarction in English or Chinese without restrictions on the publication status were included. Neurological deficit, quality of life, and response rates were analyzed. Adverse events were also investigated. RESULTS: Twenty-three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 2291 participants were included. Meta-analysis showed that DZXX injection plus routine western therapy was better than routine western therapy alone for reducing neurologic deficit (MD -2.86, 95% CI -3.87 to -1.86), for improving quality of life (MD 9.48, 95% CI 8.34-10.63), and for improving response rates (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.25). No serious adverse drug events (ADE) were reported. CONCLUSIONS: DZXX injection may have a potential therapeutic effect for cerebral infarction in reducing neurologic deficit, improving life quality and response rates. However, we could not draw any definitive conclusions due to the insufficient evidences. More high-quality trials are needed to provide more strong evidence and to assess the safety of DZXX injection.

28378105|t|Effect of magnolol on cerebral injury and blood brain barrier dysfunction induced by ischemia-reperfusion in vivo and in vitro.
28378105|a|Magnolol, a neolignan compound isolated from traditional Chinese medicine Magnolia officinalis, has a potentially therapeutic influence on ischemic stroke. Previous studies have demonstrated that cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) are involved in the pathogeneses of stroke. Therefore, in vivo and in vitro studies were designed to investigate the effects of magnolol on I-R-induced neural injury and BBB dysfunction. In cerebral I-R model of mice, cerebral infarct volumes, brain water content, and the exudation of Evans blue were significantly reduced by intravenous injection with magnolol at the doses of 1.4, 7.0, and 35.0 μg/kg. When primary cultured microglial cells were treated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus increasing concentrations of magnolol, ranging from 0.01 to 10 μmol/L, magnolol could statistically inhibit LPS-induced NO release, TNF-α secretion, and expression of p65 subunit of NF-κB in the nucleus of microglial cells. In the media of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), oxygen and glucose deprivation-reperfusion (OGD-R) could remarkably lead to the elevation of TNF-α and IL-1β levels, while magnolol evidently reversed these effects. In BBB model in vitro, magnolol dose- and time-dependently declined BBB hyperpermeability induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), OGD-R, and ephrin-A1 treatment. More importantly, magnolol could obviously inhibit phosphorylation of EphA2 (p-EphA2) not only in ephrin-A1-treated BMECs but also in cerebral I-R model of mice. In contrast to p-EphA2, magnolol significantly increased ZO-1 and occludin levels in BMECs subjected to OGD. Taken together, magnolol can protect neural damage from cerebral ischemia- and OGD-reperfusion, which may be associated with suppressing cerebral inflammation and improving BBB function.

28966646|t|Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method for acute ischemic stroke: a meta-analysis of safety and efficacy.
28966646|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method for treating acute ischemic stroke. DATA SOURCES: We retrieved relevant randomized controlled trials involving Xingnao Kaiqiao acupuncture for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Weipu Information Resources System, Wanfang Medical Data System, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Cochrane Library, and PubMed were searched from June 2006 to March 2016. DATA SELECTION: We analyzed randomized and semi-randomized clinical controlled trials that compared Xingnao Kaiqiao acupuncture with various control treatments, such as conventional drugs or other acupuncture therapies, for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The quality of articles was evaluated according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Version 5.1), and the study was carried out using Cochrane system assessment methods. RevMan 5.2 was used for the meta-analysis of the included studies. OUTCOME MEASURES: The mortality rate, disability rate, activities of daily living (Barthel Index), and clinical efficacy were observed. RESULTS: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The meta-analysis showed that between Xingnao Kaiqiao acupuncture and the control treatment, Xingnao Kaiqiao acupuncture reduced the disability rate [risk ratio (RR) = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.27-0.98, z = 2.03, P < 0.05], elevated the activities of daily living (weighted mean difference = 12.23, 95% CI: 3.66-20.08, z = 2.80, P < 0.005), and had greater clinical efficacy (RR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.23-2.09, z = 3.53, P < 0.0004). However, there was no significant difference in mortality rate (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.15-2.45, z = 0.70, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method is effective and safe for acute ischemic stroke. However, there was selective bias in this study, and the likelihood of measurement bias is high. Thus, more high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to provide reliable evidence of the efficacy and safety of Xingnao Kaiqiao acupuncture in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

28162056|t|Tanshinone IIA Elicits Neuroprotective Effect Through Activating the Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor-Dependent Antioxidant Response.
28162056|a|Tanshinone IIA (TSA), a principal component derived from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Danshen has been suggested to exert neuroprotective effect against experimental cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. But the associated underlying mechanisms still have not been understood. The current study characterized the role of nuclear factor erythroid two-related factor-induced antioxidant response in the neuroprotective efficacy of TSA treatment. The focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model was established by 60-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion. At the onset during reperfusion, mice were treated with 10 mg/kg TSA intraperitoneally. The mRNA and nuclear factor erythroid 2 (Nrf2) protein expression, the antioxidant enzymes, and oxidative production levels were measured. To further verify the role of Nrf2 in the neuroprotective effect induced by TSA, the Nrf2 small silenced RNA and Nrf2 knockout mice were used, the neurological function, brain infarct volume, and cellular apoptosis examination were assessed. TSA treatment improved neurological scores, reduced infarct volume, and attenuated the cellular apoptosis. TSA treatment upregulated the expression of Nrf2 mRNA and the contents of Nrf2 protein in nuclear extract. Nrf2 activation by TSA treatment increased the contents of antioxidant enzymes, and reduced the generation of oxidative productions. Either Nrf2 knockdown or Nrf2 knockout abolished the antioxidative and neuroprotective effect of TSA treatment. These results demonstrate that the Nrf2 activation contributes to TSA-induced neuroprotection from experimental ischemic stroke through maintaining antioxidant effect.

28743922|t|Prevalence of Stroke and Vascular Risk Factors in China: a Nationwide Community-based Study.
28743922|a|We aimed to investigate the prevalence of stroke and related vascular risk factors in adult population aged 40 years and older in China. We conducted a prospective cross-sectional survey in nationally representative sample of 207323 individuals from all 31 Chinese provinces in 2013. Data were used to analyze the prevalence of stroke by age, sex, geographical regions and educational level. The age-standardized prevalence of stroke was significantly higher in men than in women in all age groups (P < 0.001). The age-standardized prevalence of stroke was significantly higher in rural than in urban residents among both men and women (P < 0.001). The prevalence of stroke was inversely associated with educational level. There were striking geographical variations in stroke prevalence in China with a higher prevalence of stroke in northern provinces as compared with southern provinces of the country. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation and obesity in the Chinese population aged 40 years and older were 35.24%, 9.55%, 58.72%, 1.57% and 4.09%, respectively. Stroke and related vascular risk factors remains a major public threat in China and effective primary preventive strategies that aimed at reducing the burden of stroke and its risk factors are urgently needed.

28738783|t|Efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in patients with cardiac failure: a meta-analysis of clinical trials.
28738783|a|BACKGROUND: The therapeutic efficacy of coenzyme Q10 on patients with cardiac failure remains controversial. We pooled previous clinical studies to re-evaluate the efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in patients with cardiac failure. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Clinical Trials.gov databases for controlled trials. The endpoints were death, left heart ejection fraction, exercise capacity, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac function classification after treatment. The pooled risk ratios (RRs) and standardized mean difference (SMD) were used to assess the efficacy of coenzyme Q10. RESULTS: A total of 14 RCTs with 2149 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Coenzyme Q10 decreased the mortality compared with placebo (RR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.50-0.95; P = 0.02; I 2 = 0%). A greater improvement in exercise capacity was established in patients who used coenzyme Q10 than in those who used placebo (SMD = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.02-0.30; P = 0.04; I 2 = 54%). No significant difference was observed in the endpoints of left heart ejection fraction between patients who received coenzyme Q10 and the patients in whom placebo was administered (SMD = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.02-1.12; P = 0.04; I 2 = 75%). The two types of treatment resulted in obtaining similar NYHA classification results (SMD = -0.70; 95% CI = -1.92-0.51; P = 0.26; I 2 = 89%). CONCLUSION: Patients with heart failure who used coenzyme Q10 had lower mortality and a higher exercise capacity improvement than the placebo-treated patients with heart failure. No significant differences between the efficacy of the administration of coenzyme Q10 and placebo in the endpoints of left heart ejection fraction and NYHA classification were observed.

28900508|t|Direct Macromolecular Drug Delivery to Cerebral Ischemia Area using Neutrophil-Mediated Nanoparticles.
28900508|a|Delivery of macromolecular drugs to the brain is impeded by the blood brain barrier. The recruitment of leukocytes to lesions in the brain, a typical feature of neuroinflammation response which occurs in cerebral ischemia, offers a unique opportunity to deliver drugs to inflammation sites in the brain. In the present study, cross-linked dendrigraft poly-L-lysine (DGL) nanoparticles containing cis-aconitic anhydride-modified catalase and modified with PGP, an endogenous tripeptide that acts as a ligand with high affinity to neutrophils, were developed to form the cl PGP-PEG-DGL/CAT-Aco system. Significant binding efficiency to neutrophils, efficient protection of catalase enzymatic activity from degradation and effective transport to receiver cells were revealed in the delivery system. Delivery of catalase to ischemic subregions and cerebral neurocytes in MCAO mice was significantly enhanced, which obviously reducing infarct volume in MCAO mice. Thus, the therapeutic outcome of cerebral ischemia was greatly improved. The underlying mechanism was found to be related to the inhibition of ROS-mediated apoptosis. Considering that neuroinflammation occurs in many neurological disorders, the strategy developed here is not only promising for treatment of cerebral ischemia but also an effective approach for various CNS diseases related to inflammation.

28390871|t|Anfibatide protects against rat cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via TLR4/JNK/caspase-3 pathway.
28390871|a|Anfibatide (ANF) is a GPIb antagonist derived from the protein complex agglucetin. Previous studies have showed that it has protective effect on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, the mechanism of which is still unclear, however. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effect of ANF on cerebral I/R injury in rats and the possible mechanisms. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 90min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). ANF (1, 2, 4μg/kg) was achieved by intravenous injection after 120min of MCAO followed by 1h, 24h ,48h and 72h reperfusion. Neurological deficit, infarct volume, histopathology, neuronal apoptosis, NeuN and the expression of TLR4, total and phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK/p-JNK), Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, NF-κB protein in rat brain, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in serum were evaluated 72h after reperfusion. ANF could significantly decrease neurological score, reduce the infarct volumes, ameliorate the histopathological alteration, attenuate the neuronal apoptosis and increase the fluorescence density of NeuN in the rat brain. Furthermore, ANF could obviously decrease the expression of TLR4, p-JNK, caspase-3, NF-κB , relative ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in brain and the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in serum. The results indicate that ANF has protective effect against cerebral I/R injury in rats and the underlying mechanism may be associated with the suppression of apoptosis through inhibiting TLR4/JNK/caspase-3 signaling pathway.

28708869|t|Long-term efficacy and safety of carotid artery stenting versus endarterectomy: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
28708869|a|BACKGROUND: Many recent trials have investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of endarterectomy versus stenting in treating patients with carotid artery stenosis. We aimed to determine the long-term comparative efficacy and safety of both procedures by pooling this evidence in a meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published until May 6, 2016. Randomized controlled trials, which reported outcomes of interest with a median follow-up of at least 4-year, were included. RESULTS: Eight trials involving 7005 patients and 41824 patient-years of follow-up were included. In terms of the periprocedural outcomes, stenting was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.80; P = 0.003) but a higher risk of death or stroke (the composite endpoint, OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.38 to 2.25; P < 0.0001), a result that was primarily driven by minor stroke (OR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.59 to 3.01; P < 0.0001), less so by periprocedural death (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 0.82 to 3.44; P = 0.16) and major stroke (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 0.95 to 2.09; P = 0.09). In terms of the long-term outcomes, stenting was associated with a higher risk of stroke (OR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.73; P < 0.0001) and the composite outcome of death or stroke (OR 1.25; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.48; P = 0.01). No difference was found in long-term all-cause mortality between stenting and endarterectomy (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.26; P = 0.21) and restenosis (OR: 1.48 (95% CI: 0.93 to 2.35; P = 0.10). No evidence of significant heterogeneity was found in any of the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid endarterectomy was found to be superior to stenting for short- and long-term outcomes, although endarterectomy was associated with a higher risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction. Carotid endarterectomy should be offered as the first choice for carotid stenosis at present, however, more evidence is needed because rapid progress in concurrent devices and medical treatments is being made.

28808202|t|(+)-Borneol is neuroprotective against permanent cerebral ischemia in rats by suppressing production of proinflammatory cytokines.
28808202|a|Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death globally. It occurs when a major artery is occluded in the brain and leads to death of cells within the injured tissue. (+)-Borneol, a simple bicyclic monoterpene extracted from traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used in various types of diseases. However, no study has proved the effects of (+)-borneol on functional recovery from permanent ischemic stroke and the mechanism is still unknown. Here, we report that in the rat model of permanent cerebral ischemia, we found that (+)-borneol (1.0 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated infarct size and neurological scoresvia reducing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in a dose dependent manner. Notably, (+)-borneol showed long-term effects on the improvement of sensorimotor functions in the photothrombotic model of stroke, which decreased the number of foot faults in the grid-walking task and forelimb asymmetry scores in the cylinder task, at least in part through reducing loss of dendritic spines in the length, brunch number and density. These findings suggest that (+)-borneol could serve as a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.

28763875|t|[A clinical study on the effect of nattokinase on carotid artery atherosclerosis and hyperlipidaemia].
28763875|a|Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of oral nattokinase (NK) in the reduction of common carotid artery intimal medial thickness (CCA-IMT) and carotid artery plaque size and in lowering blood lipids, and to explore the underlying mechanism of actions of NK and its potential clinical use. Methods: All enrolled patients were from the Out-Patient Clinic of the Department of TCM at the 3(rd) Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Using randomised picking method, all patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, NK and Statin (ST) group. NK Group-patients were given NK at a daily dose of 6 000 FU and ST Group-patients were treated with statin (simvastatin 20 mg) daily. The treatment course was 26 weeks. CCA-IMT, carotid plaque size and blood lipid profile of the patients were measured before and after treatment. Results: A total of 82 patients were enrolled in the study and 76 patients (NK 39, ST 37) completed the study. Following the treatments for 26 weeks, there was a significant reduction in CCA-IMT and carotid plaque size in both groups compared with the baseline before treatment. The carotid plaque size and CCA-IMT reduced from(0.25±0.12)cm(2) to (0.16±0.10)cm(2) and from (1.13±0.12)mm to (1.01±0.11)mm, repectively. The reduction in the NK group was significantly profound (P<0.01, 36.6% reduction in plaque size in NK group versus 11.5% change in ST group). Both treatments reduced total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG). While the reduction in both groups was shown to be statistically significant (P<0.01), the reduction of TC, LDL-C and TG in ST group was significantly greater (P<0.05). In addition, NK significantly increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P<0.05), in contrast, HDL-C in the ST group did not change. The lipid lowering effect observed in the NK group was not correlated to the reduction of CCA-IMT and carotid artery plaque size (r=0.35, P=0.09). Conclusions: Our findings from this pioneer clinical study suggests that daily NK supplementation is an effective way to manage the progression of atherosclerosis and potentially may be a better alternative to statins which are commonly used to reduce atherosclerosis and further to prevent cardiovascular attack and stroke in patients. The mechanism underlying the reduction of carotid atherosclerosis by NK may be independent from its lipid-lowering effect, which is different from that of statins.

28683732|t|Chinese acute ischemic stroke treatment outcome registry (CASTOR): protocol for a prospective registry study on patterns of real-world treatment of acute ischemic stroke in China.
28683732|a|RATIONALE: Stroke presents a serious health problem in China. Despite progresses made in recent years, there is still a lack of effective treatments for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in clinical practices. AIMS: The Chinese Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment Outcome Registry (CASTOR) is designed to evaluate the patterns and cost-effectiveness of current treatments for AIS in real-world settings in China. DESIGN: CASTOR is a prospective, multi-center study registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02470624) with a target sample size of 10,000 patients who are experiencing AIS. The patients are treated for AIS following the Chinese stroke guideline and local practice. Real-world data on treatment regimens, outcomes and costs are collected at baseline (Visit 1) and during subsequent visits (Visit 2 to Visit 5) after medication treatments. OUTCOME: The primary objective of the present study is to analyze the current treatment status of AIS in real world settings. The secondary objectives include: 1) to compare the effectiveness of common treatment regimens, 2) to analyze the cost-effectiveness of different treatment regimens for AIS, 3) to analyze the incidence of adverse events and complications in enrolled patients with AIS, 4) to analyze the effect of Trial of Org 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification on the specific therapies during acute phase treatment period. DISCUSSION: In face of changing treatment patterns and increasing demand from medical insurers for cost-effectiveness data in China, a large-scale registry study examining the real-world patterns of AIS in hospitals is needed. The CASTOR study will help to find favorable cost-utility treatment regimens for AIS and improve the overall treatment outcome of Chinese patients with AIS.

31406759|t|The effect of Tai Chi exercise on motor function and sleep quality in patients with stroke: A meta-analysis.
31406759|a|Objective: The meta-analysis is to objectively evaluate the efficacy of Tai Chi exercise for motor function and sleep quality in patients with stroke. Methods: Randomized controlled trials(RCTs) about the effects of Tai Chi versus a non-exercise or conventional rehabilitation exercise control group on motor function and sleep quality in patients with stroke were searched from multiple electronic databases(PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, AMED, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP) until August 2016. Two investigators independently screened eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality by using the quality evaluation criteria for RCTs recommended by Cochrane Handbook. Then meta-analysis was performed by RevMan5.3 software. Results: A total of 17 RCTs with 1209 participants were included. The meta-analysis indicated that there was a significant difference on improving the balance function(P < 0.001) and ability of daily activity (P = 0.0003) of patients with stroke between Tai Chi group and control group. However, no significant effect was found on Tai Chi for walking function and sleep quality(P > 0.05). Conclusion: Tai Chi exercise can significantly improve the balance function and ability of daily activities of patients with stroke, and there are no significant differences in walking function and sleep quality. Therefore, lots of multicenter, large-sample, higher quality randomized controlled trials are needed to verify the effects of Tai Chi exercise in improving walking function and sleep quality for patients with stroke.

A poly-dimensional comparative analysis of the expression levels of 374 stroke-related genes in each of the four groups was performed using MetaCore. RESULTS: BA significantly reduced the ischemic infarct volume (P<0.05), whereas CM was ineffective. Two processes and 10 network nodes were shared between "BA vs CM" and vehicle, but there were no overlapping pathways. Two pathways, three processes and 12 network nodes overlapped in "BA vs CM" and BA. The pure pharmacological mechanism of BA resulted in targeting of pathways related to development, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, signal transduction and immunity. The biological processes affected by BA were primarily found to correlate with apoptotic, anti-apoptotic and neurophysiological processes. Three network nodes changed from up-regulation to down-regulation, while mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MAP2K6, also known as MEK6) changed from down-regulation to up-regulation in "BA vs CM" and vehicle. The changed nodes were all related to cell death and development. CONCLUSION: The pure pharmacological mechanism of BA is related to immunity, apoptosis, development, cytoskeletal remodeling, transduction and neurophysiology, as ascertained using a poly-dimensional network comparative analysis.

27512098|t|Effectiveness and safety of Chinese massage therapy (Tui Na) on post-stroke spasticity: a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial.
27512098|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Chinese massage therapy (Tui Na) for patients with post-stroke spasticity. DESIGN: A prospective, multicenter, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial. SUBJECT: A total of 90 patients with post-stroke spasticity were randomly assigned to the experimental (Tui Na therapy) group ( n = 45) or control (placebo Tui Na therapy) group ( n = 45). INTERVENTION: Participants in the experimental group received Tui Na therapy, while those in the control group received placebo-Tai Na (gentle rubbing) for 20-25 minutes per limb, once per day, five days per week for a total of four weeks. All participants in both groups received conventional rehabilitation. MAIN MEASURE: The Modified Ashworth Scale, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and the Modified Barthel Index were used to assess the severity of spasticity, motor function of limbs and activities of daily living, respectively. Assessments were performed at baseline, at four weeks and at three months. RESULTS: Tui Na group had a significantly greater reduction in Modified Ashworth Scale in only four muscle groups than the control did (elbow flexors, P = 0.026; wrist flexors, P = 0.005; knee flexors, P = 0.023; knee extensors, P = 0.017). Improvements were sustained at three months follow-up. There was no significant difference between the two groups in Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( P = 0.503) and Modified Barthel Index ( P = 0.544). No adverse reaction was recorded in any of the cases mentioned at all study sites. CONCLUSIONS: Tui Na might be a safe and effective treatment to reduce post-stroke spasticity of several muscle groups.

28438516|t|Global Transcriptomic Profiling of Cortex and Striatum: Cerebral Injury after Ischemia/Reperfusion in a Mouse Model.
28438516|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism of injury development in the cortex and the striatum after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). METHODS: Gene expression data (GSE23160) in the cortex and the striatum of an intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion-I/R mouse model (N = 12) and sham controls (N = 4) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Limma package was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the I/R (2, 8, and 24 hours) and control groups. Correlation analysis was then performed to identify the highly correlated differentially expressed genes (HCDEGs). STRING and Cytoscape software were used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of HCDEGs. Furthermore, Venny 2.0 was used to identify common overlapped DEGs whose transcription factors (TFs) were predicted using iRegulon in Cytoscape. RESULTS: For the cortex and the striatum, 2295 and 2282 DEGs were respectively identified between the I/R group and the controls, and were classified into 3 and 2 correlation modules. For each module, a PPI network was constructed, and Toll-like receptor 2 (Tlr2, degree = 25), interleukin 1β (Il1b, degree = 21), and heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1, degree = 17) had high connective degrees. Furthermore, 29 common overlapped DEGs were found across time and tissue, which might be targeted by 13 TFs. Especially, Tlr2, Il1b, and Hmox1 were targeted by myeloblastosis protein (Myb, target count = 16) and FBJ osteosarcoma protein (Fos, target count = 15). Moreover, plasminogen activator urokinase receptor (Plaur) was targeted by Fos, and it was an HCDEG in correlation modules of both cortex and striatum. Upregulation of Tlr2, Il1b, Hmox1, and Plaur in I/R injury was confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. CONCLUSION: Tlr2, Il1b, Hmox1, and Plaur regulated by Myb and Fos might participate in cortex and striatum injury after cerebral I/R.

27816479|t|Does acupuncture ameliorate motor impairment after stroke? An assessment using the CatWalk gait system.
27816479|a|The effect of acupuncture on gait deficits after stroke is uncertain. This animal study was designed to determine whether acupuncture improves gait impairment following experimentally induced ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. After 7 days' of acupuncture treatment, assessment of gait changes using the CatWalk automated gait analysis system was performed. Comparison of the CatWalk gait parameters among the groups showed that gait function was impaired after ischemic stroke and acupuncture treatment was effective in improving a variety of gait parameters including intensity, stance and swing time, swing speed and stride length at postoperative day 8. This study demonstrates a beneficial effect of acupuncture on gait impairment in rats following ischemic stroke. Further studies aimed to investigate the effects of acupuncture at different stages during stroke using the CatWalk system are required.

28583576|t|Administration of Huperzine A exerts antidepressant-like activity in a rat model of post-stroke depression.
28583576|a|Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common mood disorder following a stroke, and is also the main factor limiting recovery and rehabilitation in stroke patients. The present study was aimed to investigate whether Huperzine A (HupA) has antidepressant-like activity in a rat model of PSD, which was developed by middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by an 18-day chronic unpredictable mild stress in conjunction with isolation rearing. The sucrose preference and forced swim tests were used to assess depression-like behavior. Neurological and cognitive functions following ischemia were evaluated by neurological evaluation, the beam-walking test, the forelimb grip force test, and the water maze test. Levels of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate hippocampal expression of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor (5-HT1AR), cAMP response element binding (CREB), phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The results showed that treatment with HupA for 4weeks ameliorated behavioral abnormalities and the impairment of neurological and cognitive functions in PSD rats. This was accompanied by the upregulated hippocampal expression of 5-HT1AR, p-CREB and BDNF, and increased levels of NE, DA, and 5-HT in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that HupA has antidepressant-like effect and can improve neurological and cognitive functions in PSD rats, which suggest its therapeutic potential for depression after stroke.

29098845|t|[Animal model analysis on transient ischemic attack based on clinical symptom characteristics of Chinese and Western medicine].
29098845|a|Based on the clinical symptom characteristics of transient ischemic attack in Chinese and Western medicines, the existing models of transient ischemic attack were summarized and analyzed. Then the advantages and disadvantages of each model, the diagnostic criteria of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and clinical symptoms compliance were analyzed to put forward the evaluation method and improvement method of the corresponding animal models. It was found that there were many modeling methods of transient ischemic attack, but they can not reflect the transience, reversibility, recurrence and other typical characteristics of the disease, with significant differences with clinical symptoms. Moreover, there is lack of reasonable quantitative criteria for the success of the animal model. By combining the existing single factor animal models, a composite animal model that was more closely related to the clinical symptoms of transient ischemic attack was established to replicate an animal model that was more compatible with the characteristics of clinical symptoms. It is the future development directions of the transient ischemic attack animal models to establish reasonable quantitative standards, reflect the causes of Chinese and Western medicine symptoms and improving a series of systematic and complete model evaluation methods.

28977886|t|Combined renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and statin therapy effectively reduces the risk of cerebrovascular accident in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a nationwide population-based cohort study.
28977886|a|Fairly limited data reported the incidence and risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Additionally, little is known regarding the therapeutic impact of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade and statin on reducing the occurrence of CVA in ADPKD. We utilized the data from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to perform a population-based cohort study (1997-2013). A total of 2,647 patients with ADPKD were selected from 1,000,000 general population after excluding patients with age<18, renal replacement therapy and concomitant diagnosis of CVA. Additionally, non-ADPKD subjects were assigned as comparison group by matching study cohort with age, gender, income and urbanization in 1:10 ratio (n=26,470). The results showed that ADPKD group had significantly higher frequency rate and cumulative incidence of CVA as compared with the non-ADPKD group (8.73% v.s. 3.93%, p<0.0001). Furthermore, the frequencies of both hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes were also significantly higher in the ADPKD than non-ADPKD group (all p-values <0.0001). After adjusting for age, gender and atherosclerotic risk factors with multivariate analysis, ADPKD independently carried 2.34- and 5.12-fold risk for occurrence of CVA and hemorrhagic stroke (95% CI: 2.02-2.72 and 4.01-6.54), respectively. Combination therapy [adjusted (a) HR=0.19, 95% CI: 0.11-0.31] was superior to either RAAS blockade (aHR=0.37, 95% CI, 0.28-0.5) or statin (aHR=0.44, 95% CI, 0.24-0.79) alone for reducing the CVA occurrence in the ADPKD population. In conclusion, ADPKD was associated with an increased risk of CVA occurrence. Combined RAAS blockade and statin therapy effectively reduces the risk of CVA in ADPKD.

28672812|t|In-Depth Proteomic Analysis of the Hippocampus in a Rat Model after Cerebral Ischaemic Injury and Repair by Danhong Injection (DHI).
28672812|a|Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide. A systematic description and characterization of the strokes and the effects induced in the hippocampus have not been performed so far. Here, we analysed the protein expression in the hippocampus 24 h after cerebral ischaemic injury and repair. Drug intervention using Danhong injection (DHI), which has been reported to have good therapeutic effects in a clinical setting, was selected for our study of cerebral ischaemia repair in rat models. A larger proteome dataset and total 4091 unique proteins were confidently identified in three biological replicates by combining tissue extraction for rat hippocampus and LC-MS/MS analysis. A label-free approach was then used to quantify the differences among the four experimental groups (Naive, Sham, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and MCAO + DHI groups) and showed that about 2500 proteins on average were quantified in each of the experiment group. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that in total 280 unique proteins identified above were differentially expressed (P < 0.05). By combining the subcellular localization, hierarchical clustering and pathway information with the results from injury and repair phase, 12 significant expressed proteins were chosen and verified with respect to their potential as candidates for cerebral ischaemic injury by Western blot. The primary three signalling pathways of the candidates related may be involved in molecular mechanisms related to cerebral ischaemic injury. In addition, a glycogen synthase kinase-3β (Gsk-3β) inhibitor of the candidates with the best corresponding expression trends between western blotting (WB) and label-free quantitative results were chosen for further validation. The results of Western blot analysis of protein expression and 2,3,5- chloride three phenyl tetrazole (TTC) staining of rat brains showed that DHI treatment and Gsk-3β inhibitor are both able to confer protection against ischaemic injury in rat MCAO model. The observations of the present study provide a novel understanding regarding the regulatory mechanism of cerebral ischaemic injury.

28646892|t|Effect of acupuncture on cerebrovascular reserve in patients with acute cerebral infarction: protocol for a randomized controlled pilot study.
28646892|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of cerebral infarction has been growing year by year in China and around the world. According to clinical observation, acupuncture utilizing the "waking up the spirit" needling method is widely used in patients with cerebral infarction, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Additionally, a number of studies have begun to focus on the relationship between cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) and cerebral infarction. The present study aims to investigate whether CVR is one of potential mechanisms underpinning this effect of acupuncture on patients with cerebral infarction. METHODS: This is a single-centre, prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled pilot study. Sixty eligible patients will be randomized into an intervention group (waking up the spirit acupuncture) and a control group (hand and foot 12-meridian acupuncture) in a 1:1 ratio. All treatments will be conducted once a day on weekdays followed by a 2-day rest period on the weekend, over a total treatment course of 2 weeks. The primary outcome measures are cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) capacity and Breath-holding Index (BHI) which will be evaluated at baseline and 2 weeks after the first acupuncture treatment, and the secondary outcome measures are National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Barthel Index scores which will be used to further evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. DISCUSSION: Cerebrovascular reserve is an independent risk factor for the occurrence, progression, and recurrence of cerebral infarction that requires attention. This trial aims to investigate whether acupuncture utilizing the waking up the spirit needling method can improve CVR capacity in patients with acute cerebral infarction, thus reducing NIHSS scores and preventing further progression of the disease. Furthermore, data and evidence gained from this study will be utilized in the development of future research projects regarding the effects of acupuncture in patients with acute cerebral infarction.

28633675|t|Acupuncture treatment on the motor area of the scalp for motor dysfunction in patients with ischemic stroke: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
28633675|a|BACKGROUND: Scalp acupuncture has shown a remarkable treatment efficacy on motor dysfunction in patients with stroke in China, especially the motor area of Jiao's scalp acupuncture, which is the most widely used treatment. However, previous studies have summarized that the clinical curative effect of acupuncture treatment for stroke remains uncertain. Meanwhile, no randomized controlled trials on Jiao's scalp acupuncture have been performed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jiao's scalp acupuncture for motor dysfunction in ischemic stroke. METHODS/DESIGN: This is an assessor- and analyst-blinded, randomized controlled trial. One hundred and eight stroke patients with motor dysfunction meeting the inclusion criteria will be allocated by a 1:1 ratio into either an acupuncture treatment group or a control group. Stroke patients in the control group will receive conventional rehabilitation treatment, whereas a combination of Jiao's scalp acupuncture and conventional rehabilitation treatment will be applied to the acupuncture group. Forty treatment sessions will be performed over an 8-week period. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale will be assessed as the primary outcome measure. The Modified Barthel Index, the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life, and the Stroke Syndrome of Traditional Chinese Medicine scales will be selected as secondary outcome measurements. All assessments will be conducted at baseline, week 4 (treatment 20), week 8 (treatment 40), week 12 (follow-up), and week 16 (follow-up). DISCUSSION: This is the first trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Jiao's scalp acupuncture for motor dysfunction in ischemic stroke. The results of this trial are expected to provide relevant evidence demonstrating that Jiao's scalp acupuncture can be used as an effective rehabilitation treatment method for improving motor dysfunction in ischemic stroke.

28649223|t|Pretreatment with Sodium Phenylbutyrate Alleviates Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Upregulating DJ-1 Protein.
28649223|a|Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction play critical roles in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. DJ-1 is an endogenous antioxidant that attenuates oxidative stress and maintains mitochondrial function, likely acting as a protector of I/R injury. In the present study, we explored the protective effect of a possible DJ-1 agonist, sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB), against I/R injury by protecting mitochondrial dysfunction via the upregulation of DJ-1 protein. Pretreatment with SPB upregulated the DJ-1 protein level and rescued the I/R injury-induced DJ-1 decrease about 50% both in vivo and in vitro. SPB also improved cellular viability and mitochondrial function and alleviated neuronal apoptosis both in cell and animal models; these effects of SPB were abolished by DJ-1 knockdown with siRNA. Furthermore, SPB improved the survival rate about 20% and neurological functions, as well as reduced about 50% of the infarct volume and brain edema, of middle cerebral artery occlusion mice 23 h after reperfusion. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that preconditioning of SPB possesses a neuroprotective effect against cerebral I/R injury by protecting mitochondrial function dependent on the DJ-1 upregulation, suggesting that DJ-1 is a potential therapeutic target for clinical ischemic stroke.

29228661|t|Interactions between ACYP2 genetic polymorphisms and environment factors with susceptibility to ischemic stroke in a Han Chinese Population.
29228661|a|Aims: To investigate the association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ACYP2 gene and additional gene- environment interaction with ischemic stroke (IS) risk in a Chinese population. Results: IS risk was significantly higher in carriers with the G allele of rs11896604 than those with CC genotype (CG or GG versus CC), adjusted OR (95%CI) =1.60 (1.18-2.20), and higher in carriers with the A allele of rs12615793 than those with GG genotype (GA or AA versus GG), adjusted OR (95%CI) = 1.66 (1.24-2.15). GMDR model shown a significant two-locus model (p = 0.0010) involving rs11896604 and alcohol drinking, and a significant two-locus model (p = 0.0010) involving rs12615793 and smoking. Current smokers with rs12615793- GA or AA genotype have the highest IS risk, compared to never- smokers with rs12615793-GG genotype, OR (95%CI) = 2.72 (1.64-3.86); current drinkers with rs11896604-CG or GG genotype have the highest IS risk, compared to never- drinkers with rs11896604-CC genotype, OR (95%CI) = 2.51 (1.70-3.40). Materials and Methods: A total of 1202 participants (660 males, 542 females) were selected, including 600 IS patients and 602 control participants. The mean age of all participants was 68.2 ± 15.8 years. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to screen the best interaction combination. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the impact of 4 SNPs within ACYP2 gene, additional gene-smoking or drinking interaction on IS risk. Conclusions: We found that the G allele of rs11896604 and the A allele of rs12615793 within ACYP2 gene, rs12615793- smoking interaction, and rs11896604-alcohol drinking interaction were all associated with increased IS risk.

28587251|t|Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Distribution Kinetics of Puerarin in Rats Using Indirect Competitive ELISA.
28587251|a|Puerarin (PUE) is a compound isolated from the roots of Pueraria lobata. We studied the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution kinetics of PUE in Sprague-Dawley rats following intraperitoneal administration of three concentrations. Indirect competitive ELISA based on an anti-PUE monoclonal antibody was used to determine the concentration of PUE in the blood, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and striatum. The plasma and tissue distribution kinetic characteristics following a single injection of PUE (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) were calculated using a non-compartment model. In the high-dose (80 mg/kg) and medium-dose (40 mg/kg) groups, the kinetic profile of PUE in blood and kidney samples showed two absorption peaks, while that of the other tissues showed only one peak. In the low-dose (20 mg/kg) group, there was only one peak, irrespective of the sample type. Pharmacokinetic parameters, such as the area under the curve, Cmax, and Tmax varied according to the administered dose. AUC and Cmax values increased dose-dependently. PUE was widely distributed in areas of the brain such as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and striatum, providing a foundation for guiding the use of PUE in the treatment of cerebral ischaemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.

28431990|t|A common polymorphism decreases LRP1 mRNA stability and is associated with increased plasma factor VIII levels.
28431990|a|The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) gene is associated with increased levels of plasma factor VIII (FVIII). We aimed to explore eight functional genetic LRP1 variants for their potential roles in regulating FVIII levels and acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This genetic association study enrolled 192 patients with AIS and 134 controls. There were no significant differences in the genetic frequency of the eight functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the control and AIS groups. However, while analyzing the association between the eight SNPs and plasma FVIII levels, subjects with T/T genotype of rs1800137 (vs. CC+CT) were found to be associated with higher FVIII levels (23.5IU/dL; 95% confidence interval, 7.4-39.5IU/dL; P=0.0044) after adjusting for age, gender, estimated glomerular filtration rate, O blood type, inflammatory state, and body mass index. An analysis of the mRNA stability and abundance was designed and performed using minigene system transfected into HepG2 cells to assess the possible differences in mRNA stabilities between rs1800137 CC (rs1800137C) and TT (rs1800137T) genotypes. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that rs1800137T accounts for the observed decrease in mRNA stability. The SNP rs1800137, located in exon 8, has been identified as an exon-splicing enhancer in silico. However, alternative splicing of LRP1 without inclusion of exon 8 was not identified. In transfected HepG2 cells, cycloheximide slowed down the degradation of the rs1800137T-containing minigene. These results demonstrate that synonymous SNP rs1800137 can lead to increased plasma FVIII levels due to decreased mRNA stability via translation-dependent mRNA degradation associated with codon optimality.

28705269|t|Regional Variations in Medication Usage for Cardiovascular Diseases at the Community Level in China (PURE-China Study).
28705269|a|We investigated the usage of secondary prevention drugs and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) products in individuals with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) at the community level in China. Among 2,407 participants with self-reported coronary heart disease (CHD) and 872 with stroke, nearly 80% of individuals with CHD and 73% of individuals with stroke were not taking any proven secondary prevention drug. However, 32.9% of them took TCM products. Patients with CVDs in rural areas used less secondary prevention treatment, but more TCM products than their counterparts in the urban regions. After adjusting for confounding factors, lower rates of secondary prevention treatment were evident in Western China compared with Eastern China, which was more developed. Systematic change is needed to promote the development of evidence-based medicine at the community level in China.

28366792|t|Serum macrophage migration inhibitory factor concentrations correlate with prognosis of traumatic brain injury.
28366792|a|BACKGROUND: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a well-known pro-inflammatory cytokine. Serum MIF concentrations are associated with the severity and prognosis of ischemic stroke. METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, white blood cell (WBC) count and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and MIF among 108 severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and 108 controls were measured. We determined whether serum MIF concentrations are associated with inflammation, severity, in-hospital major adverse events (IMAEs) (i.e., in-hospital mortality, acute lung injury, acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction) and long-term clinical outcome (i.e., 6-month functional outcome) after TBI. RESULTS: As compared to the controls, serum CRP, IL-6, TNF-α and MIF concentrations were significantly increased. MIF concentrations correlated with WBC count, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α concentrations and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores. MIF in serum was independently associated with IMAEs and long-term clinical outcome. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve of MIF concentrations was similar to GCS scores'. Moreover, MIF concentrations markedly improved the predictive value of GCS scores for 6-month unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: Increased serum MIF concentrations have close relation to inflammation, trauma severity and clinical outcomes, substantializing MIF as a good prognostic biomarker after TBI.

28588676|t|Xuebijing injection attenuates pulmonary injury by reducing oxidative stress and proinflammatory damage in rats with heat stroke.
28588676|a|The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of Xuebijing injection (XBJ) on lung injury in heat-stroke rats and the underlying mechanisms. In total, 54 rats were randomly assigned to non-thermal, saline vehicle and XBJ groups. The rectal temperature (Tc), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and respiratory rate (RR) of the rats were recorded. The time-point of heat stroke and the time of survival were assessed, and indicators of arterial blood gas were regularly measured from 0 to 60 min. The concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-10 was also determined. At the end of the experiment, lung tissue was harvested for histopathological analysis. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression was measured by immunohistochemistry. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling was used to measure apoptosis. XBJ pretreatment prolonged the decline of clinical characteristics, as demonstrated by increases in Tc, MAP, RR and indicators in arterial blood gas in rats under heat stress. The time until heat stroke and the survival time in the Saline group were shorter than in rats treated with XBJ. The expression of iNOS in lung tissue and the concentration of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of rats treated with saline was higher than in rats with XBJ pre-treatment. Contrarily, SOD expression in rats treated with saline was decreased compared with that in rats treated with XBJ. Moreover, the apoptotic rate in the lung tissues of rats with saline treatment was higher than that in rats treated with XBJ. In conclusion, XBJ delayed the development of heat stroke and increased the survival time in rats under heat-stress by ameliorating pulmonary failure and acute lung injury. The underlying mechanisms of this effect may be the reduction of inflammatory cytokines as well as attenuation of oxidative stress and apoptosis by XBJ.

28664144|t|Acute toxicity and genotoxicity of fermented traditional medicine oyaksungi-san.
28664144|a|BACKGROUND: The traditional medicine oyaksungi-san (OY) has been prescribed in East Asia for hundreds of years for the treatment of stroke, paralysis, and ataxia. OY also has therapeutic effects on arthralgia, myalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis, and recent studies have shown its protective effects against apoptosis of hippocampal cells and its anti-inflammatory effects on the peripheral blood cells of patient with cerebral infarction. Many studies have explored the use of traditional medicine and herb materials in the development of safe, novel, and effective pharmaceuticals with fewer side effects. These efforts commonly adopt a bioconversion tool for fermentation with beneficial microbes. However, only pharmaceuticals with high levels of safety and low levels of toxicity can be used in healthcare system. METHODS: OY water extract was fermented with Lactobacillus and assayed for acute toxicity and genotoxicity. Single dose acute toxicity, bacterial reverse mutation, chromosome aberrations, and micronucleus were observed and assayed in rats, histidine/tryptophan auxotrophic bacteria, Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast cells, and mice bone marrow cells, respectively. RESULTS: All the experimental animals showed no abnormal behavior, clinical signs, body weight increases, or mortality. In the bacterial cultures, no revertant colonies were observed. Morphological and numerical chromosomal aberrations were not found in all metaphases examined. Frequency of induced micronuclei was not significantly increased in all doses applied. CONCLUSION: As a whole, no acute toxicity or genotoxicity were observed in all the assays examined. Therefore, fermented OY is considered to be a safe material that can be used for development of complementary and alternative medicine using bioconversion.

28396190|t|Protective Effect of 4-Methoxy Benzyl Alcohol on the Blood-Brain Barrier after Cerebral Ischemia Reperfusion Injury.
28396190|a|Damage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during the process of cerebral ischemic injury is a key factor that influences the therapeutic efficacy to the cerebral ischemic injury. This work was designed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of 4-methoxy benzyl alcohol (4-MA) on the BBB by developing a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model of rats (MCAO/R). The MCAO/R was developed through a thread embolism method. The neurologic scales, the brain infarct rate, and the Evans blue (EB) contents of the brains were detected. Meanwhile, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and activities of NO synthase (NOS) in brain tissues were measured. Western blotting analyses were also used to assess the protein expressions of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), occludin, and claudin-5 in brain tissue. After rats were pretreated with different concentrations of 4-MA, the neurologic scores, the infarct rate, and the EB contents in the brain tissues were significantly decreased. The release of NO and the activities of neuronal NOS and inducible NOS were notably inhibited. Furthermore, the protein expression of AQP-4 was markedly decreased, whereas the protein expressions of claudin-5 and occludin were significantly increased. In conclusion, the 4-MA decreases the permeability of BBB when focal cerebral ischemia occurs. The inhibition of the NOS pathways, the attenuation of the protein expression of AQP-4, and the enhancement of the expressions of the tight junction proteins might contribute to the protective effects of 4-MA on the BBB.

31682375|t|Anti-embolic effect of Taorenchengqi Tang in rats with embolic stroke induced by occluding middle cerebral artery.
31682375|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anti-embolic effect of Taorenchengqi Tang (TRCQT), a formulas from Traditional Chinese Medicine, plus aspirin in rats with embolic stroke induced by selective occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Possible side effects of hemorrhagic incident and other bleeding events and anti-platelet effect were also explored. METHODS: Ninety rats were randomly separated into 9 groups (n = 10): group 1 a sham-operated group (n = 10); groups 2 and 3 orally treated with an isovolumetric solvent (distilled water) for 1 and 3 months, followed by thromboembolic occlusion (n = 10); groups 4 and 5 orally treated with aspirin (5 mg/kg) alone for 1 and 3 months, followed by thromboembolic occlusion (n = 10); groups 6 and 7 orally treated with TRCQT (0.5 g/kg) alone for 1 and 3 months, followed by thromboembolic occlusion (n = 10); groups 8 and 9 orally treated with TRCQT plus aspirin for 1 and 3 months, respectively followed by thromboembolic occlusion (n = 10). The ischemic stroke in rats was induced by selective MCA occlusion. One was orally administered. After the treatments, rats' brains were removed, sectioned and stained with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) for infarct volume measurement. The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were observed. A potential gastric bleeding side effect was assessed by measuring hemoglobin (Hb), and prothrombin time (PT). Collagen-induced platelet activation and tail vein bleeding time were measured. RESULTS: Treatment with TRCQT alone or in combination with aspirin reduced infarct volume for 1 (P < 0.05), and 3 (P < 0.01) months without SAH and ICH incidences, and gastric bleeding. TRCQT treatment for 1 month was also not altered PT. Moreover, a concentration dependent inhibition of collagen-induced platelet activation, followed by increasing of tail vein bleeding time was observed after TRCQT treatment. CONCLUSION: Either TRCQT alone or TRCQT plus aspirin exhibits potent neuroprotective effect by reducing infarct volume without changing the status of SAH, ICH and gastric bleeding possibly via inhibiting the platelet activation and increasing bleeding time.

28562578|t|A comparative study of Danhong injection and Salvia miltiorrhiza injection in the treatment of cerebral infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
28562578|a|BACKGROUND: To evaluate systematically the clinical effectiveness and safety of Danhong injection (DI) and Salvia miltiorrhiza injection (SMI) in the treatment of cerebral infarction. METHODS: A literature search was conducted for retrieving randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on cerebral infarction treated by Danhong injection and SMI in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Wanfang Database up to January 22, 2017. Two reviewers extracted information and independently assessed the quality of included RCTs by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool; then data were analyzed with Review Manager 5.3 software. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs involving 1044 patients were included. The result of DI group was about 27% superior to SMI group in the clinical total effective rate (relative risk 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.35, P < .00001). In addition, DI could prefect neurologic impairment (standardized mean difference -1.22, 95% confidence interval -1.90 to -0.54, P = .0004), and adjust hemorheological parameters. Three RCTs occurred 4 cases of adverse drug reactions/adverse drug events, but there were no serious adverse drug reactions/adverse drug events. CONCLUSION: Comparing with SMI combined with western medicine, DI combined with conventional therapy is more effective in improving the clinical total effective rate and neurologic impairment, but more evidence-based medicine research needed to support our study further.

28382688|t|Epimedii Herba: A Promising Herbal Medicine for Neuroplasticity.
28382688|a|Epimedii Herba (EH) is an herbal medicine originating from several plants of the genus Epimedium. It is a major therapeutic option for kidney yang deficiency syndrome, which is closely related to androgen hormones and also has been used to treat hemiplegia following a stroke in traditional medicine of Korea and PR China. To date, many clinical and basic researches of EH have shown the activities on functional recovery from brain diseases. Recently, neuroplasticity, which is the spontaneous reaction of the brain in response to diseases, has been shown to accelerate functional recovery. In addition, androgen hormones including testosterone are known to be the representative of neuroplasticity factors in the brain recovery processes. In this review, we described the neuro-pharmacological activities of EH, focusing on neuroplasticity. Thirty-three kinds of papers from MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and CNKI were identified and analyzed. We categorized the results into five types based on neuroplasticity mechanisms and presented the definition of each category and briefly described the results of these papers. Altogether, we can suggest that neuroplasticity is a novel viewpoint for guiding future brain research of EH and provide the evidence for the development of new clinical applications using EH in the treatment of brain diseases.

28822160|t|[Effects of active components group of Xiaoxuming decoction on brain mitochondria in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats during early recovery period].
28822160|a|To observe the effect of active components group of Xiaoxuming decoction (XXMD) on brain mitochondria in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats during early recovery period, and study its protective mechanism for nerves in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats during early recovery period. Cerebral ischemia model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats was established by suture method, and reperfusion was conducted 2 h later. The degree of cerebral ischemia in rats was evaluated by using Zea-Longa's standard grading method, and the model rats were randomly divided into model group, Xiaoxuming decoction active components low, medium and high dose groups and positive drug Ginaton group, with sham operated rats as control group. Gradient centrifugation was used to extract the mitochondria from rat brain after 5 days of drug administration. Then the mitochondrial respiratory function was measured by Clark oxygen electrode method; mitochondrial membrane potential and the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species(ROS) level were detected by fluorescence probe methods; and the activity of mitochondrial succinodehydrogenase (SDH) and the content of ATP in the ischemic region of MCAO rats were measured by spectrophotometric method. The results showed that as compared with the model group, XXMD could significantly improve mitochondrial respiratory activity, increase the activity of SDH, reduce the level of ROS, increase mitochondrial membrane potential and obviously promote the synthesis of ATP in brain tissues. The results indicated that XXMD active components group could alleviate the energy metabolism disorders, protect brain mitochondrial damage and improve mitochondrial function in MCAO rats, which may be the mechanism of its neuroprotection activity.

28486941|t|Neuroprotective effect of salvianolate lyophilized injection against cerebral ischemia in type 1 diabetic rats.
28486941|a|BACKGROUND: Salvianolate lyophilized injection (SLI) has been clinically used in China for the treatment of acutely cerebral infarction. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that Diabetes mellitus (DM) not only increases the risk of ischemic stroke recurrence but also leads to poor outcomes and increases fatality rates after stroke. Our previous study has proved that SLI can reduce the infarct volume after stroke in type 1 diabetic rats. The aim of the study is to explore the mechanism of SLI on stroke outcome in type 1 diabetic (T1DM) rats. METHODS: Type 1 diabetes rats model (T1DM) was induced in male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) and T1DM rats were subjected to intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The T1DM + MCAO rats were randomly divided into six groups: sham-operated, model-vehicle, positive control group (Edaravone-treating, DE 6 mg/kg) and SLI-treating group (10.5 mg/kg, 21 mg/kg and 42 mg/kg). SLI and DE were administered by tail vein injection at 3 h after MCAO, then daily for 14 days. Micro-CT scans of the brain tissue revealed vessel characteristics and distribution in the ischemia zone. Glucose uptake was analyzed by PET/CT. RAGE, MMP9 and inflammatory factors (COX-2, TNF-α and ICAM-1), HQ-1, HQO-1 and Nrf-2 expression levels in the ischemic brain tissue were analyzed by Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot at 14 days after MCAO. RESULTS: In this study, we have demonstrated that SLI treatment significantly increased the number of brain microvasculature in ipsilateral and glucose uptake in cortex, hippocampus and penumbra in the T1DM + MCAO rats. SLI also significantly decreased the expression of RAGE, MMP9 and inflammatory factors expression, and increased the expression of HQ-1, HQO-1 and Nrf-2 in T1DM + MCAO rats. CONCLUSION: The study showed that SLI could protect against cerebral ischemia injury in T1DM + MCAO rats and the mechanism is related to decrease inflammatory factors and activate of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.

29696164|t|The design and rationale of the Beijing Vascular Disease Patients Evaluation Study (BEST study).
29696164|a|Aims: Arteriosclerosis and arterial stiffness increasing are the basic pathophysiological changes of vascular-related diseases, and also the predictor factors of future cardiovascular events. Plasma biomarkers such as glucose, lipids, Homocysteine (Hcy), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) have been shown to be involved the development of arteriosclerosis. The present study is a prospective observational and follow-up study of the characteristics of subclinical vascular disease detected by non-invasive methods that can predict progression of clinical overt vascular events in a Chinese population. Methods: The study including both genders with age of 45 years to 75 years was designed as observational research by questionnaires and 3-year follow-up with vascular functional and structural parameters evaluation without any interventions. Questionnaire was designed to survey the lifestyle, personal history, family history of the study population.

28320101|t|Effect of Melilotus officinalis extract on the apoptosis of brain tissues by altering cerebral thrombosis and inflammatory mediators in acute cerebral ischemia.
28320101|a|Present investigation evaluates the protective effect of Melilotus officinalis (MO) extract on the brain tissues in acute cerebral ischemia. Acute cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of carotid artery and rats with cerebral ischemia were treated with MO (100, 250 & 500mg/kg) for the duration of three days. Cerebral ischemia was confirmed by estimating infract volume and neurological deficit score. Moreover biochemical parameters in plasma such as 6-keto-PGF1α and TXB2 and concentration of cytokine, oxidative stress, apoptosis ratio and protein expressions of Bcl2 & Bax were estimated in the brain tissues. It was observed that treatment with MO significantly (p<0.01) decreases the infract volume and neurological deficit score than negative control group. There was significant decrease (p<0.01) in the oxidative stress and cytokine in the brain tissues and increase in the plasma concentration of 6-keto-PGF1α in MO treated group of rats compared to negative control group. Plasma concentration of TXB 2 was significantly enhanced in MO treated group compared to negative control group of rats. It was also found that treatment with MO ameliorates the apoptosis induced by cerebral ischemia. Present study concludes that MO ameliorates apoptosis of brain tissues in cerebral ischemic rats by decreasing cerebral thrombosis, oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators.

27488855|t|Atorvastatin Attenuates Ischemia/Reperfusion-Induced Hippocampal Neurons Injury Via Akt-nNOS-JNK Signaling Pathway.
27488855|a|Ischemia-induced brain damage leads to apoptosis like delayed neuronal death in selectively vulnerable regions, which could further result in irreversible damages. Previous studies have demonstrated that neurons in the CA1 area of hippocampus are particularly sensitive to ischemic damage. Atorvastatin (ATV) has been reported to attenuate cognitive deficits after stroke, but precise mechanism for neuroprotection remains unknown. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the neuroprotective mechanisms of ATV against ischemic brain injury induced by cerebral ischemia reperfusion. In this study, four-vessel occlusion model was established in rats with cerebral ischemia. Rats were divided into five groups: sham group, I/R group, I/R+ATV group, I/R+ATV+LY, and I/R+SP600125 group. Cresyl violet staining was carried out to examine the neuronal death of hippocampal CA1 region. Immunoblotting was used to detect the expression of the related proteins. Results showed that ATV significantly protected hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons against cerebral I/R. ATV could increase the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt1) and nNOS, diminished the phosphorylation of JNK3 and c-Jun, and further inhibited the activation of caspase-3. Whereas, all of the aforementioned effects of ATV were reversed by LY294002 (an inhibitor of Akt1). Furthermore, pretreatment with SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK) diminished the phosphorylation of JNK3 and c-Jun, and further inhibited the activation of caspase-3 after cerebral I/R. Taken together, our results implied that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of nNOS is involved in the neuroprotection of ATV against ischemic brain injury via suppressing JNK3 signaling pathway that provide a new experimental foundation for stroke therapy.

28067550|t|Association between consumption of soy and risk of cardiovascular disease: A meta-analysis of observational studies.
28067550|a|Background The relationships between dietary intake of soy foods and risk of cardiovascular disease are uncertain. The aims of this study were to evaluate and summarize the evidence on the association between consumption of soy and risk of cardiovascular disease (including stroke and coronary heart disease). Methods We systematically searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from their inception up to 22 February 2016. We included only observational studies, and used random-effects models to calculate summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results A total of 10 prospective cohort and seven case-control studies met the inclusion criteria. There were a total of 17,269 cardiovascular disease events, including 6265 stroke events, 10,806 coronary heart disease events, and 198 other cardiovascular disease events. A significant negative association was shown between soy intake and risk of cardiovascular disease (SRR = 0.84 95% CI: 0.75-0.94; pheterogeneity<0.001, I2 = 71.4%). Subgroup meta-analyses indicated that a statistically significant protective effect was primarily observed in case-control studies and in Asian populations. There was a borderline significant association between intake of tofu and the risk of cardiovascular disease (SRR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.64-1.00). A significant negative association was shown for the association between soy intake and risk of stroke (SRR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.99) and coronary heart disease (SRR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.95). There were no associations between soy isoflavones consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart disease. Conclusion Overall evidence indicated that consumption of soy was negatively associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart disease risk.

28617543|t|Study on the clinical application of the MRS in the cognitive assessment after stroke.
28617543|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the value of the application of the magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the assessment of cognitive function impairment and the observation of therapeutic effect. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 30 patients with cognitive impairment after stroke (cognitive impairment group) and 30 patients with no apparent cognitive impairment (control group of the stroke) were selected through the screening of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scale, and another 30 healthy volunteers were selected (control group of the health). The general information of gender, age, education degree, disease duration and so on was matched among the 3 groups. MRS examined all the patients of the 3 groups at the time of enrollment, and the patients of both cognitive impairment and control groups received another assessment 2 months after treatment. RESULTS: The NAA/Cr (N-acetyl aspartate/creatine) of the bilateral hippocampus of the cognitive impairment group was lower than those of both control group of stroke and health (p < 0.05), while the Cho/Cr was higher (p < 0.05). After treatment, both patients of the cognitive impairment group and the control group of the stroke experienced an increase of NAA/Cr and a decrease of Cho/Cr (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MRS is applicative in the assessment of the cognitive impairment degree of the stroke patients and can also effectively identify the existence of the cognitive impairment, which makes it preferably valuable in the clinical application.

27023223|t|An Antagomir to MicroRNA-106b-5p Ameliorates Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury in Rats Via Inhibiting Apoptosis and Oxidative Stress.
27023223|a|We previously observed that microRNA miR-106b-5p significantly increased in serum of patients with acute ischemic stroke. The present study was to determine whether miR-106b-5p antagomir can protect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was operated on male Sprague Dawley rats. MiR-106b-5p antagomir significantly decreased neurological deficit scores, infarct volumes, and neuronal injury. Furthermore, miR-106b-5p antagomir markedly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content, restored superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, increased the expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and decreased the expression of Bax in the ischemic cortex. In PC12 cells, miR-106b-5p inhibitor increased the Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expression, which provided protection against glutamate-induced apoptosis and oxidative damage, as evidenced by decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and enhanced SOD activity. Notably, luciferase reported assay proved Mcl-1 was the target gene of miR-106b-5p. In conclusion, our data indicates that the neuroprotective effects of miR-106b-5p antagomir on cerebral I/R injury are associated with its inhibition of apoptosis and oxidative stress, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.

27894149|t|2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-Glucoside Attenuates Ischemia/Reperfusion-Induced Brain Injury in Rats by Promoting Angiogenesis.
27894149|a|Cerebral ischemia can cause brain infarcts, which are difficult to recover due to poor angiogenesis. 2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside is a natural polyphenol, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, and can protect from ischemic neuronal injury. However, little is known about the effect of 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside on brain microcirculation after stroke. This study aimed at investigating the influence of 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside on brain lesions and angiogenesis after stroke. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion and treated with vehicle, nimodipine, or different doses of 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside daily beginning at 6 h post-middle cerebral artery occlusion for 14 days. The volume of cerebral infarcts, degree of neurological dysfunction, and level of microvessel density were determined longitudinally. The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin 1, and angiopoietin receptor-2 expression in the brain lesions were characterized by immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays at 14 days post-middle cerebral artery occlusion. We found that 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside significantly promoted postoperative recovery in rats by minimizing the volume of cerebral infarcts and improving neurological dysfunction in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside significantly increased the microvessel density in the brain and upregulated CD31 expression in ischemic penumbra, relative to that in the control. Finally, treatment with 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside significantly upregulated the relative levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin 1, and angiopoietin receptor-2 expression in the brain lesions of rats. Therefore, these data indicated that 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside treatment promoted angiogenesis and recovery from ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury in rats.

29071972|t|["Bell-striking" Saying of Acupuncture Therapy].
29071972|a|As an analogy, a prototype of "bell-striking" is proposed in the present paper for exploring the basic properties, major elements, and potential mechanisms of acupuncture stimulation. On the strength of analysis on the physiological basis of acupuncture effect, several fundamental aspects of acupuncture are summarized as a) the body-surface stimulating characters, b) general and local effects, and c) triggering the auto-regulative function of the organism, which mimics the "bell-striking" response. Namely, when stroke, bell will chime, otherwise, chiming will not be heard. During analyzing special contents of acupuncture theory, its formative background should not be separated, and it is improper to take, modern medical theory of the human body as the guiding thinking way for researching the ancient Chinese medical literature.

29071970|t|[Meta-analysis on the Therapeutic Effect of Acupuncture at Meridian Sinew for Spastic Paralysis After Stroke].
29071970|a|OBJECTIVE: To review systematically the clinical effects of spastic paralysis after stroke treated with acupuncture at meridian sinew ("Jingjin", musculotendon). METHODS: "Meridian sinew" "stroke" and "spasm" were taken as the key words to retrieve from the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastracture Database (CNKI), Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Library (CBM), Wanfang Data, PubMed and the Cochrane Library. The Cochrane"risk of bias" tool was used to conduct the methodological quality evaluation to the literature. RevMan 5.3 software was adopted for Meta-analysis. RESULTS: Totally, 13 papers were included, with 820 patients involved. In reference to Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook 5.0.2, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) risk of bias was assessed and it was unclear for all of the 13 papers. The results of Meta-analysis showed that the clinical effect was improved with acupuncture at meridian sinew as compared with normal acupuncture technique[①total effective rate:OR=3.86, 95% CI (2.67,5.57), Z=7.20, P<0.00001; ②modified Ashworth spasm scale:OR=4.54, 95% CI (2.91,7.10), Z=6.64, P<0.00001; ③evaluation of limb motor function with Fugl-Meyer score:MD=4.18, 95% CI (-0.59,8.94), Z=1.72, P=0.09>0.05]. The publication bias of included papers was not obvious and therefore it could be neglected in the impact on the combined effect size. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture at meridian sinew is effective in the treatment of spastic paralysis after stroke. The total clinical effect and the improvement in muscular tone with acupuncture at meridian sinew are better than those with normal acupuncture technique. The quality of the included literature is not high generally. Hence, it is necessary to have more clinical studies with high-quality and strict design.

28427392|t|Percutaneous intervention versus coronary artery bypass graft surgery in left main coronary artery stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
28427392|a|BACKGROUND: The optimal revascularization technique in patients with left main coronary artery disease (CAD) remains controversial. We aimed to compare the long-term performance of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in treatment of left main CAD. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched until November 16, 2016. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials and 22 matched observational studies including 22,487 patients and 90,167 patient-years of follow-up were included. PCI was associated with an overall higher risk for the major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio (HR), 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-1.77), mainly driven by higher rates of myocardial infarction (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.22-2.34) and revascularization (HR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.86-4.22). The overall risks for all-cause death (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.93-1.20), cardiac death (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.69-1.59), stroke (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.33-1.24), and the composite safety endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97-1.16) were similar between PCI and CABG. Stratified analysis based on stent types showed that the increased risk for myocardial infarction associated with PCI was only evident in patients with bare-metal stents or early-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), but not newer-generation DES. Stratified analyses based on study designs showed largely similar findings with the overall analyses, except for a significantly higher incidence of myocardial infarction in adjusted studies (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.64-2.45) but a trend toward higher incidence in randomized trials (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.85-2.27) associated with PCI. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CABG, PCI with newer-generation DES might be a safe alternative revascularization strategy for treatment of left main CAD, but is associated with more repeat revascularization.

28427459|t|Subjective perceived impact of Tai Chi training on physical and mental health among community older adults at risk for ischemic stroke: a qualitative study.
28427459|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence from quantitative studies suggest that Tai Chi produces a variety of health-related benefits, but few qualitative studies have investigated how older adults perceive the benefit of Tai Chi. The objective of the current study was to qualitatively evaluate the perceived benefits of Tai Chi practice among community older population. METHODS: This study was conducted with participants from a trial examining the effects of a 12-week Tai Chi training on ischemic stroke risk in community older adults (n = 170). A total of 20 participants were randomly selected from a convenience sample of participants who had completed 12-week Tai Chi training (n = 68) were interviewed regarding their perceived benefit on physical and mental health and whether Tai Chi exercise was suitable for the elderly. RESULTS: All participants agreed that Tai Chi training could relax their body and make them comfortable. Most of them thought Tai Chi training could promote physical health, including relieving pain, enhancing digestion, strengthening immunity, enhancing energy and improving sleep quality, enhancing their mental and emotional state (e.g. improving mood and reducing anxiety, improving concentration and promoting interpersonal relationship). Most of participants also agreed that Tai Chi exercise was appropriate for community older people. Three primary themes emerged from content analysis: Improving physical health; Enhancing mental and emotional state; Conforming with the request of the elderly. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that regular Tai Chi exercise may have positive benefits in terms of improved physical health and mental state among community elderly population, and may be useful and feasible body-mind exercise to community elderly population for its positive effects and advantages.

28065779|t|Effects of Panax notoginseng ginsenoside Rb1 on abnormal hippocampal microenvironment in rats.
28065779|a|Cerebral ischemia damages central neurons, and abnormal microenvironment in ischemic condition is the key factor to the damages. The increase of local concentration of glutamic acid, the overload of Ca2+, and the mitochondrial stress caused by release of cytochrome C are important factors of abnormal microenvironment in cerebral ischemia. In this study ginsenoside Rb1, a compound from Panax Notoginseng, was used to intervene abnormal environment of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region in two animal models (microperfusion model and photothrombosis model).RESULTS: Compared with the vehicle in the sham group, ginsenoside had following effects. a) ginsenoside Rb1 increased the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and the stability of neuronal ultrastructure in in the hippocampal CA1 region and improved the adaptability of neurons in two models. b) ginsenoside Rb1 improved the expression level of glial glutamate transporter1 (GLT-1) and reversed the uptake of glutamate (Glu) after ischemia, and as a result thereby decreased the excitability of Glu and the expression level of GLT-1 was proportional to the dose of ginsenoside Rb1 and similar to that of Nimodipine. c) ginsenoside Rb1 inhibited the expression level of NMDAR and the overload of Ca2+, thereby reducing neuronal damages. Meanwhile, the expression level of NMDAR was inversely proportional to the dose of ginsenoside Rb1, which was similar to that of Nimodipine. d) ginsenoside Rb1 decreased the release of cytochrome C (Cyt-C) and reduced the damages caused by neuronal mitochondrial stress. Meanwhile, the release of Cyt-C was inversely proportional to the dose of ginsenoside Rb1, which was similar to that of Nimodipine. Ginsenoside Rb1 may be as an effective drug for neuroprotection and improve cerebral blood flow after acute ischemia and prevent the secondary brain damage induced by stroke.

28214521|t|Neuroprotective effect of salvianolic acid B against cerebral ischemic injury in rats via the CD40/NF-κB pathway associated with suppression of platelets activation and neuroinflammation.
28214521|a|Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Activated platelets are increasingly regarded as initiators and/or amplifiers of inflammatory processes in cerebral I/R injury. Salvianolic acid B (SAB) is the most abundant bioactive compound of Salviae miltiorrhizae, a well-known Chinese herb used to promote blood circulation and eliminating blood stasis. S. miltiorrhizae has been used clinically in Asia for the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. In the present study, a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was established to investigate the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of SAB treatment against focal cerebral I/R insult. The results showed that SAB treatment (3mg/kg, 6mg/kg and 12mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently decreased I/R-induced neurological deficits at 24, 48, and 72h after reperfusion and decreased plasma-soluble P-selectin and soluble CD40 ligand as early as 6h after onset of I/R insult. At 24h after reperfusion, SAB treatment significantly reduced neuronal and DNA damage in the hippocampal CA1 region and decreased neural cell loss in the ischemic core. The I/R-induced pro-inflammatory mediator mRNA and protein overexpression in the penumbra cortex, including ICAM-1, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1, were significantly inhibited by SAB in a dose-dependent manner. Further studies suggested SAB treatment attenuated CD40 expression and NF-κB activation, which involved NF-κB/p65 phosphorylation and IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. In conclusion, our findings indicated that the neuroprotective effects of SAB post cerebral I/R injury are associated with the inhibition of both platelets activation and production of pro-inflammatory mediators and the downregulation of the CD40/NF-κB pathway.

28202255|t|Alleviation of ischaemia-reperfusion injury by endogenous estrogen involves maintaining Bcl-2 expression via the ERα signalling pathway.
28202255|a|The neuroprotective effects of estrogen against cerebral ischaemia have been confirmed by multiple basic and clinical studies. However, most of these studies used exogenous estrogen administered via different injection methods, and the neuroprotective effects of endogenous estrogen produced by ovaries during different phases of estrous cycle and the underlying mechanisms involved have rarely been explored. In this study, we first identified the stage of estrous cycle via vaginal smears and then measured serum estradiol levels at each phase via radioimmunoassay. We found that the estradiol level was highest in the proestrous and lowest in the diestrous. However, ovariectomy or treatment with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole significantly decreased estradiol levels compared to that of rats in diestrous. Western blotting showed that ovariectomy or letrozole treatment significantly decreased ERα and Bcl-2 protein expression and dramatically increased Bax protein expression compared with the rats in diestrous or proestrous. Rats also underwent 2h of ischaemia via middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by a 24-h reperfusion. Ovariectomy or letrozole treatment significantly decreased the neurological scores and the number of intact neurons detected via Nissl staining and dramatically increased the infarct volume detected via TTC staining and the extent of apoptosis detected via TUNEL staining and Western blotting for cleaved-caspase 3 protein expression. These results demonstrate that endogenous estrogen alleviates ischaemia-reperfusion injury by maintaining Bcl-2 expression via ERα signalling pathway and highlight the neuroprotective effects of endogenous estrogen during different stages of the estrous cycle, providing preliminary information on the underlying mechanism of this process.

28443010|t|Enhanced Functional Connectivity between the Bilateral Primary Motor Cortices after Acupuncture at Yanglingquan (GB34) in Right-Hemispheric Subcortical Stroke Patients: A Resting-State fMRI Study.
28443010|a|Increasing neuroimaging researches in stroke rehabilitation had revealed the neural mechanisms of rehabilitation therapy. However, little was known about the neural mechanisms of acupuncture therapy in subcortical stroke patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of functional connectivity (FC) between the bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) after acupuncture intervention in right subcortical stroke patients. Twenty right-hemispheric subcortical stroke patients and 20 healthy subjects were recruited to undergo one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. The scanning consisted of resting-state fMRI before and after needling at Yanglinquan (GB34), and task-evoked fMRI. The most significant active point during the left passive thumb-to-index task was chosen as the seed point. The seed-based FC analysis of the bilateral M1s was performed. Stroke patients revealed decreased FC between the bilateral M1s compared with healthy subjects, and the decreased FC was significantly enhanced after acupuncture at GB34. Acupuncture could increase the intrinsically decreased FC between the bilateral M1s which provided further insight into the neural mechanisms of acupuncture for motor function recovery in stroke patients.

28428752|t|Desensitizing Mitochondrial Permeability Transition by ERK-Cyclophilin D Axis Contributes to the Neuroprotective Effect of Gallic Acid against Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.
28428752|a|Ischemic stroke is a devastating disease with complex pathophysiology. Much evidence confirms that opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) is related with mitochondrial dysfunction to apoptosis in ischemic stroke, thus elucidating its signaling mechanism and screening novel MPTP inhibitor is therefore of paramount importance. Our earlier studies identified that gallic acid (GA), a naturally occurring plant phenol, endows with effect on inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction, which has significant neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, its molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial dysfunction remain elusive. Here, we uncover a role of GA in protecting mitochondria via MPTP inhibition. In addition to inhibit CypD binding to adenine nucleotide translocator, GA potentiates extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in cyclophilin D (CypD) expression, resulting in a desensitization to induction of MPTP, thus inhibiting caspase activation and ultimately giving rise to cellular survival. Our study firstly identifies ERK-CypD axis is one of the cornerstones of the cell death pathways following ischemic stroke, and confirms GA is a novel inhibitor of MPTP, which inhibits apoptosis depending on regulating the ERK-CypD axis.

27535816|t|Assessment of reporting quality in randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for post-stroke rehabilitation using the CONSORT statement and STRICTA guidelines.
27535816|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the completeness of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for post-stroke rehabilitation in order to provide information to facilitate transparent and more complete reporting of acupuncture RCTs in this field. METHODS: Multiple databases were searched from their inception through September 2015. Quality of reporting for included papers was assessed against a subset of criteria adapted from the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement and the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) guidelines. Each item was scored 1 if it was reported, or 0 if it was not clearly stated. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Cohen's κ-statistics were calculated to assess agreement between the two reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 87 RCTs were included in the full text. Based on CONSORT, good reporting was evident for items ''Randomised' in the title or abstract', 'Participants', 'Statistical methods', 'Recruitment', 'Baseline data', and 'Outcomes and estimation', with positive rates >80%. However, the quality of reporting for the items 'Trial design', 'Outcomes', 'Sample size', 'Allocation concealment', 'Implementation', 'Blinding', 'Flow chart', 'Intent-to-treat analysis', and 'Ancillary analyses' was very poor with positive rates <10%. Based on STRICTA, the items 'Number of needle insertions per subject per session', 'Responses sought', and 'Needle type' had poor reporting with positive rates <50%. Substantial agreement was observed for most items and good agreement was observed for some items. CONCLUSIONS: The reporting quality of RCTs in acupuncture for post-stroke rehabilitation is unsatisfactory and needs improvement.

28161193|t|Preventive treatment of astaxanthin provides neuroprotection through suppression of reactive oxygen species and activation of antioxidant defense pathway after stroke in rats.
28161193|a|Astaxanthin, a natural antioxidant carotenoid, has been shown to reduce cerebral ischemic injury in rodents. However, there have not been any studies specifically addressing whether preventive administration of astaxanthin can protect against cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this study was to examine whether pretreatment of astaxanthin can protect against ischemic injuries in the adult rats. The rats were pre-administered intragastrically with astaxanthin for seven days (once a day), and middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed at 1h after the final administration. It was found that astaxanthin prevented neurological deficits and reduced cerebral infarction volume. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying this protection, brain tissues were assayed for free radical damage, antioxidant gene expression, cell apoptosis and regeneration. The results showed that the mechanisms involved suppression of reactive oxygen species, activation of antioxidant defense pathway, and inhibition of apoptosis as well as promotion of neural regeneration. Astaxanthin did not alter body weights and the protective effect was found to be dose-dependent. Collectively, our data suggest that pretreatment of astaxanthin can protect against ischemia-related damages in brain tissue through multiple mechanisms, hinting that astaxanthin may have significant protective effects for patients vulnerable or prone to ischemic events.

27784824|t|Durability of the beneficial effect of MLC601 (NeuroAiD™) on functional recovery among stroke patients from the Philippines in the CHIMES and CHIMES-E studies.
27784824|a|Background and Aim A pre-specified country analysis of subjects from the Philippines in the CHInese Medicine NeuroAiD Efficacy on Stroke recovery (CHIMES) Study showed significantly improved functional and neurological outcomes on MLC601 at month (M) 3. We aimed to assess these effects on long-term functional recovery in the Filipino cohort. Methods The CHIMES-E (extension) Study evaluated subjects who completed three months of randomized placebo-controlled treatment in CHIMES up to two years. Blinding of treatment allocation was maintained and all subjects received standard stroke care and rehabilitation. Modified Rankin Score (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI) were assessed in-person at M3 and by telephone at M6, M12, M18, M24. Odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for functional recovery using ordinal analysis of mRS and for achieving functional independence (mRS 0-1 or BI ≥ 95) at each time point were calculated, adjusting for age, sex, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), onset-to-treatment time (OTT) and pre-stroke mRS. Results The 378 subjects (MLC601 192, placebo 186) included in CHIMES-E from the Philippines (mean age 60.2 ± 11.1) had more women ( p < 0.001), worse baseline NIHSS ( p < 0.001) and longer onset to treatment time ( p = 0.002) compared to other countries. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. The treatment effect of MLC601 seen at M3 peaked at M6 with OR for mRS shift of 1.53 (95% CI 1.05-2.22), mRS dichotomy 0-1 of 1.77 (95% CI 1.10-2.83), and BI ≥ 95 of 1.87 (95% CI 1.16-3.02). The beneficial effect persisted up to M24. Conclusion The beneficial effect of MLC601 seen at M3 in the Filipino cohort is durable up to two years after stroke.

28233623|t|Prediction Factors of Recurrent Stroke among Chinese Adults Using Retinal Vasculature Characteristics.
28233623|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify the characteristics of retinal vessels that are associated with recurrent cerebral infarction and to establish predictive model for recurrent cerebral infarction in further study. METHODS: Up to 196 patients with cerebral infarction were included in our study, including 137 patients with new onset cerebral infarction and 59 patients with recurrent cerebral infarction. Retinal vessel characteristics of all patients were analyzed and reported by an automated retinal image analysis system. Retinal and clinical characteristics were compared between recurrent and new onset subjects. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with recurrent ischemic stroke within the year after an initial stroke onset. RESULTS: Every unit increase in the vessel caliber measures of central retinal artery and vein equivalent was found to give coronary heart diseases an additional 4.28 times (95% confidence interval 1.204-15.215) the risk of stroke recurrent whereas every increased unit of arterial and venous angles would be associated with 3.9 and 13.7 times increase in such risk among atrial fibrillation subjects. Measures such as bifurcation coefficient of arterioles showed opposite effects when interacted with different clinical factors. Negative integrations were found between venous asymmetry index and various factors such as atrial fibrillation (odds ratio .73, 95% confidence interval .61-.88), coronary heart diseases (odds ratio .79, 95% confidence interval .70-.89), and bifurcation coefficient of arterioles (odds ratio .38, 95% confidence interval .21-.72), indicating a decreased recurrent risk among these subjects when venous asymmetry level increases. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal vessel characteristics interacted with each other as well as traditional clinical risk factors in affecting the risk of stroke recurrence.

29960286|t|Influence of clinical pathways used the hospitals of Traditional Chinese Medicine on patients hospitalized with stroke: a systematic review and Meta-analysis.
29960286|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of clinical pathways in the hospitals using the Traditional Chinese Medicine in treatment of stroke in terms of postoperative complications, length of stay (LOS), costs incurred during hospitalization, compared with standard medical care. METHODS: Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) platforms, Wanfang databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. The search was performed up to August 2014. Each study was assessed independently by two reviewers. The assessment of methodological quality of the included studies was based on the Methodological index for non-randomized studies standard. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan software, version 5.0. RESULTS: Six studies met the study inclusion criteria and were included in the Meta-analysis for a total sample of 710 patients. The aggregate overall results showed that shorter length of stay in the clinical pathway group was observed during hospital stay was associated with the use of the clinical pathways. No significant differences were found in other effects. CONCLUSION: Regardless the possible limitations, our findings show that clinical pathways can significantly reduce LOS. Although there is no clear evidence that clinical pathways can reduce hospital costs, but the cost of hospitalization path group for each included study were lower than the control group.

26910818|t|Plasma Homocysteine and Prognosis of Acute Ischemic Stroke: a Gender-Specific Analysis From CATIS Randomized Clinical Trial.
26910818|a|Elevated total homocysteine level (tHcy) has been hypothesized to be associated with morbidity and mortality of stroke; however, results regarding the association between plasma tHcy status and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke are inconsistent. Moreover, the gender effect on this association has yet to be explored. We thus prospectively investigated whether higher tHcy concentrations predicted poor stroke prognosis in Chinese adults. A total of 3309 acute ischemic stroke patients were included in this prospective multicenter study from the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke (CATIS). Baseline tHcy concentrations were quantitatively determined via enzymatic cycling assay. The primary outcome was a combination of death and major disability at 3 months (modified Rankin scale scores 3-6) after hospitalization. Multivariate logistic regression models with restricted cubic splines were used to determine the association between baseline plasma tHcy and the subsequent outcome. Higher plasma tHcy concentrations were associated with increased risks of the primary outcome in women but not in men (P interaction = 0.016). Adjusted odds ratios comparing two extreme tHcy quartiles were 1.83 (95 % confidence interval 1.12-2.98; P trend = 0.02) in women and 0.87 (95 % confidence interval 0.61-1.25; P trend = 0.37) in men. The significant association between baseline tHcy status and stroke prognosis in women, but not in men, persisted in further subgroup analyses, stratified by age, baseline systolic blood pressure, and other pre-specified factors. Elevated tHcy is positively associated with poor prognosis of acute ischemic stroke in women, but not in men. Further studies are needed to replicate our findings and to clarify the potential sex-specific mechanisms.

26894397|t|The Emerging Role of Epigenetics in Cerebral Ischemia.
26894397|a|Despite great progresses in the treatment and prevention of ischemic stroke, it is still among the leading causes of death and serious long-term disability all over the world, indicating that innovative neural regenerative and neuroprotective agents are urgently needed for the development of therapeutic approaches with greater efficacy for ischemic stroke. More and more evidence suggests that a spectrum of epigenetic processes play an important role in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. In the present review, we first discuss recent developments in epigenetic mechanisms, especially their roles in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. Specifically, we focus on DNA methylation, histone deacetylase, histone methylation, and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of vascular and neuronal regeneration after cerebral ischemia. Additionally, we highlight epigenetic strategies for ischemic stroke treatments, including the inhibition of histone deacetylase enzyme and DNA methyltransferase activities, and miRNAs. These therapeutic strategies are far from clinic use, but preliminary data indicate that neuroprotective agents targeting these pathways can modulate neural cell regeneration and promote brain repair and functional recovery after cerebral ischemia. A better understanding of how epigenetics influences the process and progress of cerebral ischemia will pave the way for discovering more sensitive and specific biomarkers and new targets and therapeutics for ischemic stroke.

28289242|t|Acupuncture Attenuated Vascular Dementia-Induced Hippocampal Long-Term Potentiation Impairments via Activation of D1/D5 Receptors.
28289242|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Emerging evidence suggests that acupuncture could improve cognitive impairment in vascular dementia by enhancing synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether dopamine, a key mediator of synaptic plasticity, is involved in this cognitive improvement. METHODS: Vascular dementia model was established by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion in male Wistar rats. Three days after the operation, animals received acupuncture treatment for 2 weeks, once daily. The D1/D5 receptors antagonist SCH23390 was administered intraperitoneally 15 minutes before each acupuncture treatment. Morris water maze was examined after acupuncture. Long-term potentiation was studied by an electrophysiological technique. Dopamine and metabolites levels were detected by microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography from brain tissue. The expression of D1R and D5R was analyzed by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Acupuncture remarkably reversed cognitive deficits in 2-vessel occlusion model (2VO) rats, and the acupuncture points Zusanli (ST36) and Baihui (GV20) were confirmed to be the most effective combination. Electrophysiological recording data showed that 2VO-induced impairments of long-term potentiation were prevented by acupuncture. In addition, acupuncture promoted the release of dopamine and its major metabolites in the hippocampus of 2VO rats. The immunofluorescence experiment showed that the decrease of D1R and D5R in hippocampal dentate gyrus region of 2VO rats was reversed by acupuncture. Furthermore, we found that the effects of acupuncture against 2VO-induced impairments in cognition and synaptic plasticity were abolished by SCH23390. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in cognition and hippocampal synaptic plasticity induced by acupuncture was achieved via activation of D1/D5 receptors in 2VO rats.

28361971|t|PG2 for patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
28361971|a|PG2 is an infusible polysaccharide extracted from Astragalus membranaceus, which is a Chinese herb traditionally used for stroke treatment. We investigated the effect of PG2 on patients with spontaneous acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). A total of 61 patients with acute spontaneous ICH were randomized to either the treatment group (TG, 30 patients), which received 3 doses of PG2 (500 mg, IV) per week for 2 weeks, or the control group (CG, 31 patients), which received PG2 placebo. At 84 days after PG2 administration, the percentage of patients with a good Glasgow outcome scale (GOS 4-5) score in the TG was similar to that in the CG (69.0% vs. 48.4%; p = 0.2). The percentage of good mRS scores (0-2) in the TG was similar to that in the CG (62.1% vs. 45.2%; p = 0.3). In addition, no significant differences were seen when comparing differences in the C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and S100B levels between baseline and days 4, 7, and 14 after PG2 administration (all p > 0.05). The results are preliminary, necessitating a more thorough assessment.

28351388|t|Buyang Huanwu decoction facilitates neurorehabilitation through an improvement of synaptic plasticity in cerebral ischemic rats.
28351388|a|BACKGROUND: Loss of neural function is a critical but unsolved issue after cerebral ischemia insult. Neuronal plasticity and remodeling are crucial for recovery of neural functions after brain injury. Buyang Huanwu decoction, which is a classic formula in traditional Chinese medicine, can positively alter synaptic plasticity. This study assessed the effects of Buyang Huanwu decoction in combination with physical exercise on neuronal plasticity in cerebral ischemic rats. METHODS: Cerebral ischemic rats were administered Buyang Huanwu decoction and participated in physical exercise after the induction of a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. The neurobehavioral functions and infarct volumes were evaluated. The presynaptic (SYN), postsynaptic (GAP-43) and cytoskeletal (MAP-2) proteins in the coronal brain samples were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. The ultrastructure of the neuronal synaptic junctions in the same region were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Combination treatment of Buyang Huanwu decoction and physical exercise ameliorated the neurobehavioral deficits (p < 0.05), significantly enhanced the expression levels of SYN, GAP-43 and MAP-2 (p < 0.05), and maintained the synaptic ultrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: Buyang Huanwu decoction facilitated neurorehabilitation following a cerebral ischemia insult through an improvement in synaptic plasticity. Graphical abstract The Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD) combined with physical exercise (PE) attenuates synaptic disruption and promotes synaptic plasticity following cerebral ischemia (stroke).

28400733|t|Optimization of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction for Ischemic Stroke Treatment and Mechanistic Study by Metabolomic Profiling and Network Analysis.
28400733|a|Optimal drug proportions and mechanism deciphering of multicomponent drugs are critical for developing novel therapies to cope with complex diseases, such as stroke. In the present study, orthogonal experimental design was applied to explore the optimal proportion of the four component herbs in Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) on the treatment of ischemic stroke. The treatment efficacies and mechanisms were assessed using global and amino acids (AAs) targeted metabolomics, as well as correlation network analysis. The global NMR metabolomics results revealed that AAs metabolism was significantly perturbed in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats. The levels of 23 endogenous AAs were then subjected to HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis. These results complemented with neurobehavioral evaluations, cerebral infarct assessments, biochemical evaluations, histological inspections and immunohistochemistry observations strongly demonstrated that HLJDD with optimal proportion of 6 (Rhizoma coptidis): 4 (Radix scutellariae): 1 (Cortex phellodendr): 3 (Fructus Gardeniae) had the best efficacy on ischemic stroke, which could be ascribed to its modulation on AA metabolism. This integrated metabolomics approach showed the potential and applicable in deciphering the complex mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine formulae on the treatment of complicated diseases, which provided new means to assess the treatment effects of herb combinations and to further development of drugs or therapies based on these formulae.

28236683|t|Extraction and isolation of potential anti-stroke compounds from flowers of Pueraria lobata guided by in vitro PC12 cell model.
28236683|a|A simple and efficient method based on ultrafiltration liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS) was applied to rapidly screen and identify ligands for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from the flowers of Pueraria lobata, and the compounds were assessed for anti-stroke activity using a PC12 cell model. Seven major isoflavones, kakkalide, 3'-hydroxy puerarin, puerarin, puerarin xyloside, tectoridin, tectorigenin, and ononin, were identified as potent LDH inhibitors. A continuous online method, which consisted of microwave-assisted extraction and countercurrent chromatography (MAE-CCC), was newly developed for scaled-up production of these compounds with high purity and efficiency. This novel approach, using UFLC-MS coupled with MAE-CCC and a PC12 cell model, provided a powerful tool for screening, extraction, and separation of LDH inhibitors from complex samples, and a useful platform for the large-scale production of functional food and nutraceutical ingredients.

28213110|t|Effect of Chinese herbal medicine on stroke patients with type 2 diabetes.
28213110|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Complications of type 2 diabetes (T2D) include stroke, which is a cerebrovascular disturbance characterized by reduced blood flow in the brain, leading to death or physical disability. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been widely used in ancient China for the treatment of diabetes and stroke by supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the frequencies and patterns of CHM treatment for stroke patients with T2D and the outcomes of long-term use in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 3079 stroke patients (ICD-9-CM: 430-438) with T2D. We allocated 618 stroke patients, matched for age, gender, and T2D-to-stroke duration, to both CHM and non-CHM groups. Chi-square test, conditional multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test were used in this study. RESULTS: The CHM group was characterized by more cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ulcer disease, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and higher income. The cumulative survival probability was higher in the CHM group (P<0.001, log rank test); after adjusting for comorbidities, income, and urbanization level, this group also exhibited a lower mortality hazard ratio (0.37, 95% confidence interval [0.25-0.55]). Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang, Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang, and Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng-Tang; and Dan-Shen, Niu-Xi, and Yan-Hu-Suo represented the top three formulas and herbs, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of CHM as adjunctive therapy may improve the overall survival (OS) of stroke patients with T2D. The list of the comprehensive herbal medicines that they used might be useful in future large-scale, randomized clinical investigations of agent effectiveness, safety, and potential interactions with conventional treatments in stroke patients with T2D.

28102082|t|Characterization of the Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Chronic Phase of Stroke in a Cynomolgus Monkey Model of Induced Cerebral Ischemia.
28102082|a|Stroke is one of the main causes of mortality and long-term disability worldwide. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disease are not well understood, particularly in the chronic phase after the initial ischemic episode. In this study, a Macaca fascicularis stroke model consisting of two sample groups, as determined by MRI-quantified infarct volumes as a measure of the stroke severity 28 days after the ischemic episode, was evaluated using qualitative and quantitative proteomics analyses. By using multiple online multidimensional liquid chromatography platforms, 8790 nonredundant proteins were identified that condensed to 5223 protein groups at 1% global false discovery rate (FDR). After the application of a conservative criterion (5% local FDR), 4906 protein groups were identified from the analysis of cerebral cortex. Of the 2068 quantified proteins, differential proteomic analyses revealed that 31 and 23 were dysregulated in the elevated- and low-infarct-volume groups, respectively. Neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and inflammation featured prominently as the cellular processes associated with these dysregulated proteins. Protein interaction network analysis revealed that the dysregulated proteins for inflammation and neurogenesis were highly connected, suggesting potential cross-talk between these processes in modulating the cytoskeletal structure and dynamics in the chronic phase poststroke. Elucidating the long-term consequences of brain tissue injuries from a cellular prospective, as well as the molecular mechanisms that are involved, would provide a basis for the development of new potentially neurorestorative therapies.

27876538|t|Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and the hematoma volume and stroke severity in acute intracerebral hemorrhage patients.
27876538|a|BACKGROUND: Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) serves as a powerful inflammatory marker for predicting cardiovascular events. Here, we investigate whether admission NLR is associated with hematoma volume, stroke severity, and 3-month outcomes in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS: 352 patients with acute ICH were prospectively identified in this study. Demographic characteristics, lifestyle risk factors, NIHSS score, hematoma volumes, and other clinical features were recorded for all participants. Patients was divided into quartiles based on the admission NLR levels (Q1: <2.78; Q2: 2.78-4.08; Q3: 4.08-7.85; Q4: ≥7.85). Multivariable linear regression models and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between NLR and hematoma volume, admission severity, or the outcomes after ICH. RESULTS: Median NIHSS scores for each quartile (Q1 to Q4) were 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, and 11.0 (P=.001), and median hematoma volumes were 9.5, 9.3, 9.1, and 15.0ml (P=.005), respectively. After adjusting the age, sex, and other potential risk factors, the patients in Q4 had higher NIHSS scores (P=.042) and larger hematoma volume (P=.014). After 3-month follow-up, 148 poor outcomes (mRS, 3-6) and 47 all-cause deaths were documented. There were more patients with poor outcomes in Q4 than Q1. However, compared with the patients in Q1, those in Q4 were not associated with poor outcomes (P-trend=0.379), and all-cause mortality (P-trend=0.843) after adjust for other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Higher admission NLR are associated with larger hematoma volume and more serious stroke, but not 3-month outcomes in patients with acute ICH.

28318138|t|Safety and efficacy of 6-month versus 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy in patients after implantation of multiple biodegradable polymer-coated sirolimus-eluting coronary stents: Insight from the I-LOVE-IT 2 trial.
28318138|a|OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare the clinical outcomes of 6-month versus 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients receiving multiple biodegradable polymer-coated sirolimus-eluting stents (BP-SES) implants. BACKGROUND: The clinical outcomes for patients who undergo multiple BP-SES implantation with different DAPT durations are uncertain. METHODS: In the I-LOVE-IT 2 trial, 907 patients treated with multiple BP-SES (total stent number ≥2) were assigned to receive 6-month (n = 440) or 12-month (n = 467) DAPT. The primary endpoint was 12-month target lesion failure (TLF), which is a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (MI) or clinically indicated target lesion revascularization. The major secondary endpoints were 12-month net adverse clinical events, a composite of all causes of death, MI, stroke, any revascularization and bleeding. RESULTS: The number of stents per patient between the 6-month and 12-month DAPT group was similar (2.4 ± 0.7 vs. 2.4 ± 0.7, P = 0.47). The incidence of 12-month TLF was comparable in the 6-month and 12-month DAPT groups (9.3% vs.7.5%, Log-rank P = 0.33). However, landmark analysis showed that 12-month DAPT, compared to 6-month DAPT, was associated with a significantly lower risk of TLF (4.8% vs. 2.4%, Log-rank P = 0.049) at a cost of a slightly increased risk of all bleeding events (0.5% vs. 1.7%, Log-rank P = 0.07) between 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: In patients treated with multiple BP-SES, 6- and 12-month DAPT had similar impacts on 12-month clinical outcomes. Additionally, 12-month DAPT might reduce TLF between 6 and 12 months at the cost of a slightly increased risk of all bleeding events. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

28132925|t|Combined NADPH and the NOX inhibitor apocynin provides greater anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in a mouse model of stroke.
28132925|a|Our previous study has reported that the pentose phosphate pathway product nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) protected neurons against ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury. NADPH can either act as a co-enzyme to produce GSH or a substrate of NADPH oxidase (NOX) to generate ROS. This study was designed to elucidate the effects of co-treatment with NADPH and NOX inhibitor apocynin on ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain inflammation and neuronal injury. The results showed that both NADPH and apocynin markedly attenuated ischemia/reperfusion-induced increases in the levels of NOX2, NOX4 and ROS. NADPH and apocynin significantly inhibited the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, NF-κBp65 nuclear localization, and the expression of NF-κB target gene cyclooxygenase (COX2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Furthermore, both NADPH and apocynin suppressed the expression of inflammasome proteins including NLRP3 ASC, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 in the ischemic cortex as revealed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Moreover, all these effects were greatly amplified by combination of NADPH and apocynin. Both NADPH and apocynin significantly reduced infarct volume, improved post-stroke survival, and recovery of neurological functions in mouse model of stroke. Consistently, the combination of NADPH and apocynin produced greater beneficial effects in against ischemic brain damage. These studies suggest that, beyond anti-oxidative effects, NADPH may also have anti-inflammatory effects and combination of NADPH and NOX inhibitors could produce a greater neuroprotective effect in ischemic stroke.

27875362|t|Relationship Between HIV Infection, Antiretroviral Therapy, Inflammatory Markers, and Cerebrovascular Endothelial Function Among Adults in Urban China.
27875362|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular risk is increased in people living with HIV infection compared with age-matched uninfected individuals. Cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction related to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and inflammation may contribute to higher stroke risk in HIV infection. METHODS: We compared cerebral vasoreactivity-a measure of cerebrovascular endothelial function assessed by the breath-holding index (BHI) using transcranial Doppler ultrasound-between virologically suppressed Chinese HIV-infected individuals followed in an HIV clinic in Beijing, China, and uninfected controls. We constructed mixed-effects models to evaluate the association of HIV, ART, and inflammatory markers with cerebral vasoreactivity. RESULTS: In an unadjusted model, HIV infection was associated with a trend toward lower cerebral vasoreactivity (BHI 1.08 versus 1.26, P = 0.079). In multivariable analyses, cholesterol modified the association between HIV infection and cerebral vasoreactivity (P = 0.015 for interaction). At a lower total cholesterol of 4.15 mmol/L, HIV was associated with lower cerebral vasoreactivity (BHI -0.28, P = 0.019), whereas at a cholesterol of 5.15 mmol/L, the reduction in cerebral vasoreactivity associated with HIV was no longer statistically significant (BHI -0.05, P = 0.64). Among HIV-infected individuals, use of lopinavir/ritonavir compared with efavirenz was associated with lower cerebral vasoreactivity (BHI -0.24, P = 0.040). We did not find a significant association between inflammatory markers and cerebral vasoreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction associated with HIV infection may be most relevant for individuals with less traditional vascular risk, such as those with lower cholesterol. Further study of the impact of ART on cerebrovascular endothelial function is warranted to aid with ART selection in individuals at high cerebrovascular risk.

27584547|t|Correlation Between the Revised Brain Symmetry Index, an EEG Feature Index, and Short-term Prognosis in Acute Ischemic Stroke.
27584547|a|PURPOSE: The present study aims to investigate the correlation between EEG features and short-term prognosis in patients who have experienced an acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: The present study included 29 patients who had experienced an acute ischemic stroke and were treated at the Beijing Dongzhimen Hospital affiliated with Beijing University of Chinese Medicine between January 2010 and January 2012. Patients were evaluated using the revised Brain Symmetry Index (r-BSI), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and Glasgow Coma Scale. Functional outcomes were assessed 21 days after admission using the Barthel Index and modified Rankin Scale. Two groups were created based on the Barthel Index (<60 vs. ≥60) and modified Rankin Scale (<3 vs. ≥3). RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in r-BSI, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores between the two groups. Poor functional outcomes were associated with higher r-BSI and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores as well as lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores in comparison with those obtained for patients with good prognosis. Logistic regression analysis revealed that r-BSI scores at admission exhibited significant negative correlation with Barthel Index scores (-2.070, P = 0.049) and significant positive correlation with modified Rankin Scale scores (2.256, P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: The r-BSI may be a valuable prognostic tool in the prediction of short-term outcomes for patients who have experienced acute ischemic stroke. SIGNIFICANCE: The early prediction of functional outcomes after stroke may enhance clinical management and minimize short-term mortality.

28150376|t|A Noninvasive Sonographic Study of Multisite Atherosclerosis in an Elderly Chinese Population.
28150376|a|OBJECTIVES: A sonographic study was conducted to determine the prevalence of atherosclerosis across multiple arterial beds in an elderly Chinese population and to examine relationships between detected atherosclerosis and traditional risk factors. METHODS: A total of 197 participants underwent sonography of the abdominal aorta and bilateral carotid, femoral, and lower limb arteries. Images were reviewed to determine the presence or absence of plaques in each artery. Plaque thickness was measured as the indicator of plaque burden. Plaque prevalence was estimated per site and correlated with age, sex, and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Plaque frequency and thickness were compared between different arterial beds. RESULTS: Of the 197 participants (54% female; age range, 58-86 years), 90% had plaques present in at least 1 artery, and 55% had plaques present in at least 4 arteries. The most common sites for plaques were the carotid arteries (80%), followed by the lower limb arteries (59%), femoral arteries (57%), and abdominal aorta (37%). Plaque prevalence in each arterial bed except the abdominal aorta was significantly associated with male participants (P < .05), increasing age (P < .003) and FRS (P < .04). Male participants were more likely to have carotid (P = .04), femoral (P = .045), and lower limb (P = .006) plaques than female participants, but there was no significant difference in aortic plaque prevalence between male and female participants (P = .9). CONCLUSIONS: Plaque prevalence increased significantly in the carotid and peripheral arteries with increasing FRS. These findings should be considered for designing screening programs for stroke and heart attack prevention.

28469657|t|Fermented Chinese formula Shuan-Tong-Ling attenuates ischemic stroke by inhibiting inflammation and apoptosis.
28469657|a|The fermented Chinese formula Shuan-Tong-Ling is composed of radix puerariae (Gegen), salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), radix curcuma (Jianghuang), hawthorn (Shanzha), salvia chinensis (Shijianchuan), sinapis alba (Baijiezi), astragalus (Huangqi), panax japonicas (Zhujieshen), atractylodes macrocephala koidz (Baizhu), radix paeoniae alba (Baishao), bupleurum (Chaihu), chrysanthemum (Juhua), rhizoma cyperi (Xiangfu) and gastrodin (Tianma), whose aqueous extract was fermented with lactobacillus, bacillus aceticus and saccharomycetes. Shuan-Tong-Ling is a formula used to treat brain diseases including ischemic stroke, migraine, and vascular dementia. Shuan-Tong-Ling attenuated H2O2-induced oxidative stress in rat microvascular endothelial cells. However, the potential mechanism involved in these effects is poorly understood. Rats were intragastrically treated with 5.7 or 17.2 mL/kg Shuan-Tong-Ling for 7 days before middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced. The results indicated Shuan-Tong-Ling had a cerebral protective effect by reducing infarct volume and increasing neurological scores. Shuan-Tong-Ling also decreased tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β levels in the hippocampus on the ischemic side. In addition, Shuan-Tong-Ling upregulated the expression of SIRT1 and Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of acetylated-protein 53 and Bax. Injection of 5 mg/kg silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor EX527 into the subarachnoid space once every 2 days, four times, reversed the above changes. These results demonstrate that Shuan-Tong-Ling might benefit cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by reducing inflammation and apoptosis through activation of the SIRT1 signaling pathway.

28994524|t|[Clinical value evaluation of Chinese herbal formula in context of multi-omics network].
28994524|a|Clinical value evaluation is the key issue to solve the problems such as high repetition rate, fuzzy clinical positioning, broad indications and unclear clinical values in Chinese herbal formula(Chinese patent medicine). By analyzing the challenges and opportunities of Chinese herbal formula in clinical value evaluation, this paper introduced a strategy of multi-omic network analysis. Through comparative analysis of three stroke treatment formulas, we suggested their different characteristic advantages for variant symptoms or phenotypes of stroke, which may provide reference for rational clinical choice. Such multi-omic network analysis strategy may open a unique angle of view for clinical evaluation and comparison of Chinese herbal formula.

The Ca2+/Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)/cAMP response element-binding (CREB) signaling pathway plays an important role in the intracellular signal transduction pathway involved in cell proliferation, cell survival, inflammation and metabolism. Herein, the neuroprotective roles of PF in the models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion in rats and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons were investigated. Moreover, we attempted to confirm the hypothesis that its protection effect is via the modulation of the Ca2+/CaMKI)/CREB signaling pathway. In this study, PF not only significantly decreased neurological deficit scores and infarct volume in vivo, but also improved neurons' cell viability, and inhibited neurons' apoptosis and intracellular Ca2+ concentration in vitro. Furthermore, PF significantly up-regulated p-CREB and p-CaMKII, and down-regulated calmodulin (CaM) in vivo and in vitro. The results indicate that the protective effect of PF on cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury is possible through regulating the Ca2+/CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway.

28367097|t|Lyophilized Powder of Catalpol and Puerarin Protected Cerebral Vessels from Ischemia by Its Anti-apoptosis on Endothelial Cells.
28367097|a|Catalpol and puerarin are two monomers of Rehmannia glutinosa and Lobed Kudzuvine Root, which are two herbs commonly used together in ancient prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine for cerebral ischemia. Our previous study shows that the lyophilized powder of the two monomers improved the outcome of cerebral ischemia excellently in rodents. However, if it protects vessels from ischemia is unknown. The present research studied the protection of lyophilized powder of catalpol and puerarin (CP) on endothelial cells and the relative mechanism in vivo and in vitro. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats were used to study the improvement of CP on neurological deficiency, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and infarct volume. The morphology of vessels and the apoptosis of brain vascular endothelial cells (BVECs) were observed and detected by immunohistochemistry approaches. To study how CP protected primary BVECs (pBVECs) from ischemic penumbra, oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-damaged pBVECs were cultured in the condition of insufficient nutrition and low oxygen which recapitulate the low perfusion of ischemic penumbra. Using the cell model, the mechanism by which CP protected pBVECs was studied by shRNA and pathway inhibitors. CP at the dose of 65.4 mg/kg increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), reduced infarct volume, protected vessel integrity and inhibited endothelial cell apoptosis in vivo. But it only improved rCBF, vessel integrity and BVECs apoptosis at the dose of 32.7 mg/kg. In vitro, the protection of CP on pBVECs was proved to be ERK/HIF-1a- and PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1a-dependent. This study indicates a possibility of CP being a new drug for cerebral ischemia. Besides, this research provides an alternative cell model for penumbra ECs study.

29072001|t|[Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials of Eye-acupuncture Therapy for Patients with Post-stroke Insomnia].
29072001|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of eye-acupuncture therapy for post-stroke insomnia. METHODS: Sixty patients (45-70 years in age) with post-stroke insomnia were randomized into eye-acupuncture group and routine acupuncture (body acupuncture) group (30 cases in each). Patients of the eye-acupuncture group were treated by acupuncture stimulation of bilateral Shangjiao (Upper-energizer) and Xin (Heart) regions and those of the routine acupuncture group treated by acupuncture stimulation of Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Anmian (EX-HN 16), etc. After Deqi, the filiform needles were retained for 20 min, and the treatment in both groups was conducted once a day, with 15 days being one therapeutic course and 2 courses altogether. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) including the subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and total PSQI score was used to evaluate the overall sleep quality. The clinical efficacy was assessed according to the "Guiding Principles of Clinical Trials for New Drugs of Traditional Chinese Medicine" formulated by Chinese Ministry of Health. RESULTS: Following the treatment, of the two 30 cases in the eye-and routine acupuncture groups, 21 and 9 experienced a marked improvement in their symptoms, 8 and 17 were effective, and 1 and 4 invalid, with the effective rate being 96.7% and 86.7%, respectively. The PSQI scores of the subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and the total PSQI score were all significantly decreased in comparison with pre-treatment in each group (P<0.01). The therapeutic effect of the eye-acupuncture was markedly superior to those of routine acupuncture in reducing sleep latency, sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction (P<0.05), but without significant differences between the two groups in the effective rate, sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep efficiency and total PSQI score (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both eye-acupuncture and routine acupunture are effective in the treatment of post-stroke insomnia, and the eye-acupuncture is better than routine acupuncture in reducing sleep latency, improving sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction.

29071991|t|[Effect of Electroacupuncture on Expression of Apelin-APJ System of Cerebral Vascular Endothelial Cell in Rats with Cerebral Infarction].
29071991|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the regulation of APJ and its ligand Apelin on the angiogenesis pathway after cerebral infarction and the intervention effect of acupuncture. METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into model group(n=90), electroacupuncture(EA) group(n=90), sham operation group(n=90) and control group(n=10). The first three groups were further divided into 1,3,6,9,12,24 h and 3,7, 12 d subgroups(n=10 in each subgroup). The cerebral infarction model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). EA(15 Hz, 2 mA) was applied to "Shuigou" (GV 26) for 20 min in the EA group. The 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 h subgroups were treated immediately after modeling, the 3, 7, 9 d subgroups were treated once daily for 3, 7 or 9 days. Real-time fluorescent quantitative (RT-PCR) and Western blot were applied to detect the changes of Apelin and APJ in cerebrovascular endothelial cells, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the expression of Apelin-APJ mRNA was decreased in the model group(12 h, 12 d, P<0.05, P<0.01); After EA, the Apelin mRNA expression was increased in the 12 h and 7 d subgroups (P<0.01), while the APJ mRNA expression was increased in the 6, 9, 12 h subgroups(P<0.05, P<0.01). Compared with the control group, the Apelin(1, 3, 6, 24 h and 3, 7, 12 d) and APJ(1, 3, 6, 9 h and 3 d) protein expressions were decreased in the model group(P<0.01, P<0.05); After EA, the Apelin protein expression was increased in the 6, 24 h and 3, 7, 12 d subgroups (P<0.05, P<0.01), while the APJ protein expression was increased in the 1, 9, 12, 24 h and 3, 7, 12 d subgroups (P<0.05, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: EA can up-regulate the expression of Apelin-APJ mRNA and protein of cerebral vascular endothelial cell in MCAO rats which has an important role in the establishment of blood vessel regeneration and collateral circulation.

28087473|t|Salvianolic Acids for Injection (SAFI) suppresses inflammatory responses in activated microglia to attenuate brain damage in focal cerebral ischemia.
28087473|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory reactions induced by microglia in the brain play crucial roles in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) cerebral injuries. Microglia activation has been shown to be closely related to TLR4/NF-κB signal pathways. Salvianolic acids for injection (SAFI) have been used in clinical practice to treat ischemic stroke with reported neuroprotective effects; however, the underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: First, we studied the effect of SAFI on inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia. Then, to discover whether the beneficial in vitro effects of SAFI lead to in vivo therapeutic effects, an MCAO (Middle cerebral artery occlusion) rat model was further employed to elucidate the probable mechanism of SAFI in treating ischemic stroke. Rats in the SAFI group were given SAFI (23 or 46mg/kg) before I/R injury. RESULTS: The results showed that SAFI treatment significantly decreased neuroinflammation and the infarction volume compared with the vehicle group. Activation of microglia cells was reduced, and TLR4/NF-κB signals, which were markedly inhibited by SAFI treatment in ischemic hemisphere, were accompanied by reduced expression and release of cytokines IL-1β and IL-6. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that SAFI effectively protects the brain after cerebral ischemia, which may be caused by attenuating inflammation in microglia.

28202067|t|Acupuncture for acute moderate thalamic hemorrhage: randomized controlled trial study protocol.
28202067|a|BACKGROUND: Thalamic hemorrhage (TH) is a neurological insult with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Moderate TH (10-30 ml) accounts for more than half of all TH. Treatment remains controversial. The role of acupuncture in patients with moderate TH is not clear. METHODS: We will conduct a single-center, randomized, parallel group, and assessor-blinded clinical trial. A total of 488 patients with moderate TH will be randomly assigned to one of eight groups: 10-15 cc left sided TH study group (N = 61) and a corresponding control group (N = 61), 10-15 cc right sided TH study group (N = 61) and a corresponding control group, 15-30 cc left sided TH study group (N = 61) and a corresponding control group (N = 61), and 15-30 cc right sided TH study group (N = 61) and a corresponding control group. Study groups will receive acupuncture in addition to standard treatment, while control groups will receive standard treatment alone. The primary outcome will be change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores at 30 and 90 days after TH. The secondary outcomes will be death or major disability, defined as a score of 3 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale (in which a score of 0 indicates no symptoms, a score of 5 indicates severe disability, and a score of 6 indicates death) at 90-days, need for surgery at 30-days, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at 90-days following TH onset, and the results of several additional group specific tests. The rate of adverse events will then be compared between the groups. DISCUSSION: This study will attempt to answer the question of whether or not acupuncture can improve neurologic outcome following moderate TH. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese clinical trial registry (ChiCTR-IOR-16008362).

28069373|t|Memantine attenuates cell apoptosis by suppressing the calpain-caspase-3 pathway in an experimental model of ischemic stroke.
28069373|a|Ischemic stroke, the second leading cause of death worldwide, leads to excessive glutamate release, over-activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), and massive influx of calcium (Ca2+), which may activate calpain and caspase-3, resulting in cellular damage and death. Memantine is an uncompetitive NMDAR antagonist with low-affinity/fast off-rate. We investigated the potential mechanisms through which memantine protects against ischemic stroke in vitro and in vivo. Middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO) was performed to establish an experimental model of ischemic stroke. The neuroprotective effects of memantine on ischemic rats were evaluated by neurological deficit scores and infarct volumes. The activities of calpain and caspase-3, and expression levels of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95) were determined by Western blotting. Additionally, Nissl staining and immunostaining were performed to examine brain damage, cell apoptosis, and neuronal loss induced by ischemia. Our results show that memantine could significantly prevent ischemic stroke-induced neurological deficits and brain infarct, and reduce ATP depletion-induced neuronal death. Moreover, memantine markedly suppressed the activation of the calpain-caspase-3 pathway and cell apoptosis, and consequently, attenuated brain damage and neuronal loss in MCAO rats. These results provide a molecular basis for the role of memantine in reducing neuronal apoptosis and preventing neuronal damage, suggesting that memantine may be a promising therapy for stroke patients.

29231472|t|[Acupuncture with smoothing liver and regulating qi for post-stroke slow transit constipation and its gastrointestinal hormone level].
29231472|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy between acupuncture with smoothing liver and regulating qi and lactulose for post-stroke slow transit constipation(STC) and to explore the mechanism. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomized into an acupuncture group and a medication group,30 cases in each one. Based on the comprehensive stroke unit care,acupuncture with smoothing liver and regulating qi was used at Danzhong(CV 17),Qihai(CV 6),Tianshu(ST 25),Neiguan(PC 6),Gongsun(SP 4) and Taichong(LR 3) in the acupuncture group,once a day. Lactulose oral liquid was taken at a draught in the morning in the medication group,20 to 30 mL a time,once a day. The study period was 11 weeks,including 1-week baseline evaluation,6-week treatment and 4-week follow-up. We recorded the time of the first independent defecation,constipation symptom score,and gastrointestinal hormone level,including somatostatin(SS),motilin(MTL),P substance(SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP). Also,the side effects were recorded at any time. RESULTS: The time of the first independent defecation was (30.18±16.14) h in the acupuncture group,which was significantly different from (43.22±28.42) h in the medication group(P<0.05). The constipation scores after 6-week treatment and at follow-up were lower than those before treatment in the two groups (all P<0.05),with better results in the acupuncture group(both P<0.05). MTL and SP increased,as well as SS and VIP decreased after treatment in the two groups(all P<0.05). The changes were better in the acupuncture group(all P<0.05). The side effect was not observed in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture with smoothing liver and regulating qi achieves better effect than lactulose for post-stroke STC in terms of efficacy onset,extent,and long term. The mechanism may relate to increasing excitatory regulatory peptide and reducing inhibitory regulatory peptide.

29931923|t|[Expressions of SERCA2a and miR-25-3p/5p in myocardium of rats with heart failure and therapeutic effects of Xiefei Lishui recipe].
29931923|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expressions of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) mRNA and miR-25-3p/5p in myocardium of rats with heart failure and the therapeutic effects of Xiefei Lishui recipe(Traditional Chinese Medicine). METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into five groups:control group, model group, Traditional Chinese Medicine group(TCM group), captopril group and digoxin group(n=10). Heart failure rat model was induced by intraperitoneal injections of doxorubicin(6 injections within 2 weeks; total dose:15 mg/kg). Five weeks after the first injection, Distilled water(10 ml/(kg·d)), TCM(22 g/(kg·d)), captopril(19 mg/(kg·d)),and digoxin(32μg/(kg·d))were administrated by gastrogavage for 35 days,respectively. Myocardial expressions of SERCA2a mRNA and miR-25-3p/5p were detected;myocardial activities of SERCA2a were measured; cardiac output(CO) and left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) and plasma level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured. RESULTS: Myocardial mRNA expression of SERCA2a was significantly down-regulated in rats with heart failure which could be significantly up-regulated by TCM or captopril or digoxin,while expressions of miR-25-3p and miR-25-5p in myocardium were significantly up-regulated which could be significantly down-regulated by TCM or captopril. SERCA2a activity, CO and LVEF in rats with heart failure were decreased significantly which could be significantly increased by TCM,while plasma level of BNP was increased significantly which could be significantly decreased by TCM or captopril or digoxin. CO in rats with heart failure could be signifi-cantly increased by captopril or digoxin. CONCLUSIONS: In rats with heart failure, myocardial mRNA expression of SERCA2a was downregulated, expression of miR-25-3p and miR-25-5p in myocardium was upregulated. Xiefei Lishui recipecan upregulate myocardial mRNA expression of SERCA2a, downregulate expression of miR-25-3p and miR-25-5p in myocardium and improve cardiac function.

28082198|t|Neuroprotectant androst-3β, 5α, 6β-triol suppresses TNF-α-induced endothelial adhesion molecules expression and neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells by attenuation of CYLD-NF-κB pathway.
28082198|a|Neuroinflammation is one of key pathologic element in neurological diseases including stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer' s Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and multiple sclerosis as well. Up-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules, which facilitate leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, is the vital process of endothelial cells mediated neuroinflammation. Androst-3β, 5α, 6β-triol (Triol) is a synthetic steroid which has been reported to have neuroprotective effects in hypoxia/re-oxygenation-induced neuronal injury model. In the present study, we firstly investigated whether Triol inhibited the TNF-α-induced inflammatory response in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMECs). Our data showed that Triol decreased TNF-α-induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the adhesion of neutrophil to RBMECs. We also found that Triol inhibited TNF-α-induced degradation of IκBα and phosphorylation of NF-κBp65 that are required for NF-κB activation. Furthermore, Triol significantly reversed TNF-α-induced down-expression of CYLD, which is a deubiquitinase that negatively regulates activation of NF-κB. These results suggest that Triol displays an anti-inflammatory effect on TNF-α-induced RBMECs via downregulating of CYLD-NF-κB signaling pathways and might have a potential benefit in therapeutic neuroinflammation related diseases.

27475119|t|Patient and Family Member Factors Influencing Outcomes of Poststroke Inpatient Rehabilitation.
27475119|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate how family members' attitudes toward functional regain, and patients' knowledge and intention of independence influence poststroke rehabilitation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Three rehabilitation inpatient settings. PARTICIPANTS: Younger (n=79) and older (n=84) poststroke patients, along with their family members (spouses, n=104; children, n=59). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Custom-designed questionnaires were used to tap into the patients' knowledge about rehabilitation (Patient's Rehabilitation Questionnaire-Knowledge About Rehabilitation) and intention of independence (Patient's Rehabilitation Questionnaire-Intention of Independence), and family members' attitudes toward patients in performing basic activities of daily living (BADL) (Family Member Attitudes Questionnaire-BADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (Family Member Attitudes Questionnaire-instrumental activities of daily living). The rehabilitation outcomes included gains in motor, cognitive, and emotional functions, and self-care independence, measured with common clinical instruments. RESULTS: The Family Member Attitudes Questionnaire-BADL predicted cognitive outcome and the Patient's Rehabilitation Questionnaire-Intention of Independence predicted motor outcome for both groups. Differential age-related effects were revealed for the Patient's Rehabilitation Questionnaire-Intention of Independence in predicting emotional outcome only for the younger group, and self-care independence only for the older group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' intention of independence positively affected motor recovery, while family members' positive attitudes promoted cognitive regain. The findings suggested plausible age-related differences in how patients' intentions affect emotion versus self-care independence outcomes. Future studies should explore strategies for promoting positive attitudes toward independence among patients and family members during poststroke rehabilitation.

28137521|t|Gender-based differences in mortality and complementary therapies for patients with stroke in Taiwan.
28137521|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide. In this retrospective study, we investigated the different effects of gender on medical behavior, medical service, medical cost, and death from stroke in Taiwan. METHODS: We collected data on the stroke-associated mortality rate according to gender and age group for the period between 2009 and 2013 from the official registry of Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan. We analyzed the data related to stroke-associated medical care and costs in 2013 from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). RESULTS: The mortality rate due to stroke was higher in men than in women, despite more inpatient or outpatient medical treatment and higher medical costs, especially in patients aged <50years. Married women showed a significantly lower stroke-associated mortality compared to married men. Women were significantly more likely to accept Western medicine combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment than men (81.51% of women and 74.27% of men). They had lower medical expenditure and lower mortality from stroke than men did. Combined use of integrative Chinese and Western medicine also was associated with lower mortality from stroke than use of conventional Western medicine alone. CONCLUSIONS: In Taiwan, stroke-associated mortality is higher in men. Marriage or female sex hormone may have protective effect against stroke in women. Women also more tended to seek TCM complementary therapies combined with Western medicine. Integrated Chinese and Western medicine could thus be a potential treatment for stroke.

28054226|t|Picroside II Exerts a Neuroprotective Effect by Inhibiting the Mitochondria Cytochrome C Signal Pathway Following Ischemia Reperfusion Injury in Rats.
28054226|a|Stroke is a common neurodegenerative disease in the wide world, and mitochondrial defects underlie the pathogenesis of ischemia, especially during reperfusion. Picroside II, the principal active component of Picrorhiza, is a traditional Chinese medicine. Our previous study demonstrated that the best therapeutic dose and time window were injection of picroside II at a dose of 10-20 mg/kg body weight following cerebral ischemia by 1.5-2.0 h. In this paper, the neuroprotective effect and the mechanism of picroside II were investigated, as well as its involvement in antioxidant and mitochondria cytochrome C (CytC) signal pathway following ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. After 24 h of cerebral I/R, the neurobehavioral function was measured by modified neurological severity score test; the content of reactive oxygen species in brain tissue was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the cerebral infarction volume was detected by TTC staining; the morphology of brain tissue was observed by hematoxylin-eosin; the apoptotic cells were counted by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay; the ultrastructure of the cortical brain tissues was observation by transmission electron microscopy; the expressions of CytC and Caspase-3 were determined by immunohistochemical assay and Western blot. The results indicated that picroside II could scavenge ROS contents, decrease the cerebral infarction volume and apoptotic cells, protect the structure of mitochondria, down-regulate the expression of CytC and Caspase-3 in cerebral I/R rats.

27868379|t|Qualitative and quantitative analysis of multiple components for quality control of Deng-Zhan-Sheng-Mai capsules by ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method coupled with chemometrics.
27868379|a|Deng-Zhan-Sheng-Mai capsules are a well-known traditional Chinese patent medicine that was developed in China for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Its quality control focuses on Erigerontis Herba but ignores the contributions of Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus, and Ophiopogonis Radix. To improve the quality standards for this medicine, this work reports the application of a systematic ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method coupled with chemometrics. Three qualitative and quantitative parameters are established for the evaluation of quality: chemical profiling, the relationship between the contents of 18 compounds and the antioxidant activity, and chemometric analysis. A total of 55 compounds, including 20 phenolic acids, 10 flavonoids, 15 saponins, and 10 lignans, were identified. The method for the quantitative determination of the aforementioned 18 compounds was validated. The limit of quantification ranged from 0.13 to 9.60 ng/mL. The overall recoveries ranged from 95.31 to 103.54%. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were applied to the data of 18 components in ten batches of samples. Nine compounds, including scutellarin, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Re, ginsenoside Rg1, ophiopogonin D, schisandrin, and schisandrol B, are suggested as chemical markers for evaluating the quality.

28151910|t|Assessment of left ventricular function in chronic alcoholics by real-time three-dimensional echocardiography.
28151910|a|Chronic alcohol consumption may lead to progressive cardiac dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) on assessing left ventricular (LV) function in chronic alcoholics.We classified 92 male alcoholics into mild, moderate, and severe groups; 30 age-matched controls were also recruited. LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), LV mass (LVM), LV mass index (LVMI), and systolic dyssynchrony index (SDI) were measured by 3DE and 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DE).Compared to the control group, LV volume and mass were higher in the moderate and severe alcoholic groups (P < 0.05). The severe alcoholic (symptomatic) group demonstrated decreased LVEF and increased SDI (detected by 3DE) (P < 0.05).Real-time 3DE can detect the increases of LV volumes and mass in asymptomatic alcoholics, and the changes of LVEF and systolic synchrony index in symptomatic alcoholics.

27585466|t|Panax notoginseng saponins administration modulates pro- /anti-inflammatory factor expression and improves neurologic outcome following permanent MCAO in rats.
27585466|a|Ischemic stroke, particularly permanent occlusion, accounts for the overwhelming majority of all strokes. In addition to the occlusion of arteries, the inflammatory response plays a pivotal role in the severity of the cerebral injury and its clinical prognosis. Here, panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) extracted from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine was administered following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats to explore the neuroprotective mechanisms against ischemic injury. The results showed that MCAO surgery was successful in producing an infarct and that PNS and nimodipine could ameliorate the neurological deficits. The expression levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were increased, while the level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was reduced in the infarct cortex 7 days after MCAO, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). PNS was able to markedly reduce the overexpression of IL-1β and TNF-α while significantly promoting the expression of IL-10, but did not affect the elevated expression of TGF-β1. Meanwhile, nimodipine was able to significantly reduce the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α, but had no obvious effect on IL-10 or TGF-β1. In addition, the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-10 and TGF-β1 were basically consistent with cerebral tissue results; however, the IL-1β levels did not differ. We conclude that PNS can directly down-regulate the overexpression of proinflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α while up-regulating the expression of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 in the core region of the cerebral infarct, thereby preventing neurological damage in rats after permanent MCAO.

27590260|t|Effect of electroacupuncture in patients with post-stroke motor aphasia : Neurolinguistic and neuroimaging characteristics.
27590260|a|BACKGROUND: In this study we investigated the neurolinguistic and neuroimaging characteristics of post-stroke motor aphasia patients. The effects of acupuncture on cortex activation by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with motor aphasia were also studied. METHODS: In this study 43 patients with motor aphasia after stroke were assessed according to Clinical Rehabilitation Research Center aphasia examination (CRRCAE) for linguistic evaluation and MRI and computed tomography (CT) were used for the analyses of brain lesions. The MRI imaging data were also examined using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) software. Cortex activation images during acupuncture were analyzed using generalized linear model analysis. RESULTS: The results of MRI and CT showed diverse brain lesion regions of post-stroke motor aphasia including the cortex, subcortex and cortex together with the subcortex. The language-related brain areas are activated by acupuncture including frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes as well as insula, precuneus and other wide range of brain function areas as shown by MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the brain lesion regions in post-stroke motor aphasia were not completely consistent with the classical motor speech center. By using MRI our study results suggest that the formation of cognitive language may be involved with the cortical-subcortical functional networks. Acupuncture may be useful for treatment of motor aphasia after stroke.

28168001|t|The neuroprotective effects of Tao-Ren-Cheng-Qi Tang against embolic stroke in rats.
28168001|a|BACKGROUND: Combinations of the traditional Chinese and Western medicines have been used to treat numerous diseases throughout the world, and there is a growing body of evidence showing that some of the herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine elicit significant pharmacological effects. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of Tao-Ren-Cheng-Qi Tang (TRCQT) in combination with aspirin following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced embolic stroke in rats. METHODS: A blood clot was embolized into the middle cerebral artery of rats to induce focal ischemic brain injury. After 24 h of MCAO occlusion, the rats were arbitrarily separated into five groups and subjected to different oral treatment processes with TRCQT and aspirin for 30 days before being evaluated in terms of their neurological behavior using a four-point system. The rats were sacrificed at 30 days after drug treatment and the infarct volumes were measured using a 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining method. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), activated caspase-3 and Bax were detected by western blot analysis. The apoptotic cells were identified by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. ROS generation was also measured by electron spin resonance spectrometry. RESULTS: Rats treated with TRCQT alone or in combination with aspirin showed a significantly reduced infarct volume (P < 0.001) and improved neurological outcome compared with those treated with distilled water. Rats treated with TRCQT alone (P = 0.021) or in combination with aspirin (P = 0.02) also showed significantly reduced MCAO-induced expression levels of TNF-α and pJNK (P < 0.001) in their ischemic regions. Rats treated with TRCQT alone or in combination with aspirin showed decreased apoptosis by a reduction in the number of TUNEL positive cells, which inhibited the expression of activated caspase-3 (P = 0.038) and Bax (P = 0.004; P = 0.003). TRCQT also led to a significant concentration-dependent reduction in the formation of hydroxyl radicals (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TRCQT reduced brain infarct volume and improved neurological outcomes by reducing apoptosis, attenuating the expression of TNF-α and p-JNK, and reducing the formation of hydroxyl radicals in MCAO-induced embolic stroke of rats.

28117389|t|The identification and molecular mechanism of anti-stroke traditional Chinese medicinal compounds.
28117389|a|Stroke is a worldwide epidemic disease with high morbidity and mortality. The continuously exploration of anti-stroke medicines and molecular mechanism has a long way to go. In this study, in order to screen candidate anti-stroke compounds, more than 60000 compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database were computationally analyzed then docked to the 15 known anti-stroke targets. 192 anti-stroke plants for clinical therapy and 51 current anti-stroke drugs were used to validate docking results. Totally 2355 candidate anti-stroke compounds were obtained. Among these compounds, 19 compounds are structurally identical with 16 existing drugs in which part of them have been used for anti-stroke treatment. Furthermore, these candidate compounds were significantly enriched in anti-stroke plants. Based on the above results, the compound-target-plant network was constructed. The network reveals the potential molecular mechanism of anti-stroke for these compounds. Most of candidate compounds and anti-stroke plants are tended to interact with target NOS3, PSD-95 and PDE5A. Finally, using ADMET filter, we identified 35 anti-stroke compounds with favorable properties. The 35 candidate anti-stroke compounds offer an opportunity to develop new anti-stroke drugs and will improve the research on molecular mechanism of anti-stroke.

28114983|t|Panaxatriol saponins promotes angiogenesis and enhances cerebral perfusion after ischemic stroke in rats.
28114983|a|BACKGROUND: Panaxatriol saponins (PTS), an extract from the traditional Chinese herb Panax notoginseng, which has been used to treat ischemic stroke for many years in China. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of PTS remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether PTS can protect against ischemic brain injury by promoting angiogenesis and to explore the possible mechanism by which it promotes angiogenesis. METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced in rats, and neurological deficit scores and brain infarct volumes were assessed. Micro-Positron emission tomography (PET) was adopted to assess cerebral perfusion, and real-time PCR and western blotting were used to evaluate vascular growth factor and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway component levels. Immunofluorescence staining was used to determine capillary densities in ischemic penumbrae. RESULTS: We showed that PTS improved neurological function and reduced infarct volumes in MCAO rats. Micro-PET indicated that PTS can significantly increase 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-PDG) uptake by ischemic brain tissue and enhance cerebral perfusion after MCAO surgery. Moreover, PTS was able to increase capillary densities and enhance angiogenesis in ischemic boundary zones and up-regulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) expression by activating the Shh signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that PTS exerts protective effects against cerebral ischemic injury by enhancing angiogenesis and improving microperfusion.

27836299|t|On pump versus off pump coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with end-stage renal disease and coronary artery disease - A nation-wide, propensity score matched database analyses.
27836299|a|OBJECTIVE: The usage of on or off cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with coronary artery disease receiving coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery had been debated and had not yet been investigated thoroughly in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We aimed to study cardiovascular outcomes and total mortality in these patients by using our National Health Insurance (NHI) database. METHOD: By using our NHI ESRD claim database, we searched ESRD patients aged more than 18years, who received CABG and divided them into on pump and off pump groups. Baseline characteristics and underlying comorbidities were identified from the database. Propensity score (PS) method was used to match all the potential confounders between patients. Outcomes including mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke and repeat revascularization within 30days, 1year and whole follow-up period were also obtained. RESULT: A total of 134,410 ESRD patients were identified in the database. We included 341 patients and 543 patients who received off pump and on pump CABG respectively. The hazard ratios of different outcomes at 30days, 1year and a median of 745days after CABG did not show significant different between on, or off pump groups before and after PS match. CONCLUSION: ESRD patients with CAD undergoing either on pump or off pump CABG surgery showed similar outcomes in 30days, 1year and whole follow-up period.

29231326|t|[Huxiang acupuncture and massage academic school with "the combination of five meridians" for post-stroke urinary incontinence].
29231326|a|The theory of "combination of five meridians" focuses on meridians and acupoints as well as compatibility and interrelationship of generation and restriction of five elements. By regulating corresponding meridians to diseased zangfu, the relationship of unbalanced zangfu is balanced, which can regulate body function and effectively treat diseases. Under the guide of theory "the combination of five meridians", according to etiology and pathogenesis of post-stroke urinary incontinence, wind, fire and phlegm, from three aspects of deficiency, excess and deficient root and excessive surface, under the treatment principle of "nourishing the mother if it is deficient, reducing the son if it is excessive", the original meridian, son meridian, mother meridian, conquering meridian and conquered meridian are selected while the methods of nourishing the mother, reducing the son, reinforcing the suppression and developing the weak are applied, so as to discuss the acupuncture treatment for post-stroke urinary incontinence, which can provide new clinical thoughts of acupuncture treatment for post-stroke urinary incontinence.

28056920|t|Huatuo Zaizao pill promotes functional recovery and neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats.
28056920|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is the third leading cause of death in adults worldwide and is the first leading cause of long-term disability. Neurogenesis plays an important role in promoting behavioral recovery after stroke. Huatuo Zaizao pill (HT), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used clinically in China to promote the rehabilitation after stroke, but the underlying mechanism of action was still unclear. This study is to investigate the effects of HT on the functional recovery in a rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and the potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into sham, model with cerebral I/R injury, or HT-treated groups, then administered orally with vehicle (for the sham and model group) or HT (0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg) respectively, for 3 or 7 days. Functional recovery was assessed by cylinder test, beam walking test, and adhesive test. Neurogenesis was investigated by double immunofluorescence staining for 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) and neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN). The proteins of kinase A (PKA), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were assayed by western blotting. The level of BDNF mRNA was evaluated by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, treatment with HT significantly promoted functional recovery in I/R injured rats (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). The generation of new neurons was increased in the HT groups. HT treatment for 3 days increased the level of BDNF mRNA in I/R injured rats. Expression of PKA, phosphorylated CREB, and BDNF were significantly (p < 0.05) increased with the 7-day HT treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that HT treatment could promote functional recovery after stroke. HT enhanced the expression of BDNF and increased the level of neurogenesis in cerebral I/R animal, which might be associated with the functional recovery.

28168099|t|Gait disorder as a predictor of spatial learning and memory impairment in aged mice.
28168099|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether gait dysfunction is a predictor of severe spatial learning and memory impairment in aged mice. METHODS: A total of 100 12-month-old male mice that had no obvious abnormal motor ability and whose Morris water maze performances were not significantly different from those of two-month-old male mice were selected for the study. The selected aged mice were then divided into abnormal or normal gait groups according to the results from the quantitative gait assessment. Gaits of aged mice were defined as abnormal when the values of quantitative gait parameters were two standard deviations (SD) lower or higher than those of 2-month-old male mice. Gait parameters included stride length, variability of stride length, base of support, cadence, and average speed. After nine months, mice exhibiting severe spatial learning and memory impairment were separated from mice with mild or no cognitive dysfunction. The rate of severe spatial learning and memory impairment in the abnormal and normal gait groups was tested by a chi-square test and the correlation between gait dysfunction and decline in cognitive function was tested using a diagnostic test. RESULTS: The 12-month-old aged mice were divided into a normal gait group (n = 75) and an abnormal gait group (n = 25). Nine months later, three mice in the normal gait group and two mice in the abnormal gait group had died. The remaining mice were subjected to the Morris water maze again, and 17 out of 23 mice in the abnormal gait group had developed severe spatial learning and memory impairment, including six with stride length deficits, 15 with coefficient of variation (CV) in stride length, two with base of support (BOS) deficits, five with cadence dysfunction, and six with average speed deficits. In contrast, only 15 out of 72 mice in the normal gait group developed severe spatial learning and memory impairment. The rate of severe spatial learning and memory impairment was significantly higher in the abnormal gait group as compared to that in the normal gait group (x = 21.986, P < 0.001). All five parameters used to assess gait predicted severe spatial learning and memory impairment in aged mice (P < 0.01). However, the difference of the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve for each quantitative gait parameter was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Gait disorders are a predictor of severe spatial learning and memory impairment in aged mice, and stride length, variability of stride length, base of support, cadence, and average speed are all sensitive parameters for assessing gait.

27880884|t|Anti-atherosclerosis and cardio-protective effects of the Angong Niuhuang Pill on a high fat and vitamin D3 induced rodent model of atherosclerosis.
27880884|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Angong Niuhuang Pill (ANP) is a well known Chinese traditional therapeutic for the treatment for diseases affecting the Central Nervous System (CNS). Components of the ANP formulation, including Bovis Calculus Sativus, Pulvis Bubali Comus Concentratus, Moschus, Margarita, Cinnabaris, Realgar, Coptidis Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Gardeniae Fructus, Curcumae Radix, and Bomeolum Syntheticum, have been used for the treatment of stroke, encephalitis and emergency meningitis across Asia, especially in China for hundreds of years. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the anti-atherosclerosis and cardio-protective effects of ANP administration using a rodent model of atherosclerosis induced by a high fat and vitamin D3. METHODS: Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) 78 male SD rats were randomly divided into a control group and 5 atherosclerotic model groups. The atherosclerotic groups were divided to receive either Simvastatin (SVTT, 0.005g/kg), Low-dose ANP (0.125g/kg), Medium-dose ANP (0.25g/kg), and High-dose ANP (0.5g/kg). Following adaptive feeding for one week, atherosclerosis was induced and the atherosclerosis model was established. Experimental drugs (either simvastatin or ANP) or normal saline were administered intragastrically once daily for 9 weeks starting from the 8th week. A carotid artery ultrasound was performed at the 17th week to determine whether atherosclerosis had been induced. After the atherosclerosis model was successfully established, platelet aggregation rates, serum biochemical indices, apoptosis-related Bcl-2, Bax proteins levels in the heart were assayed. Pathological and histological analysis was completed using artery tissue from different experimental different groups to assess the effects of ANP. RESULTS: ANP signiﬁcantly decreased aortic membrane thickness, the maximum platelet aggregation rates, and the ratio of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). In addition, ANP signiﬁcantly reduced serum contents of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, troponin I, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. ANP markedly improved abnormal pathological conditions of the aorta and heart, and helped to prevent myocardial apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that ANP has robust ant-atherosclerosis and cardio-protective effects on a high-fat and vitamin D3 - induced rodent model of atherosclerosis due to its antiplatelet aggregation, lipid regulatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties.

29098620|t|Clinical Evidence of Exercise Benefits for Stroke.
29098620|a|Even though stroke is the third, not the first, most common cause of disability-adjusted life years in developed countries, it is one of the most expensive to treat. Part of the expense is due to secondary problems in the post-stroke period including: cognition, memory, attention span, pain, sensation loss, psychological issues, and problems with mobility and balance. Research has identified that exercise has both positive physical and psychosocial effects for post-stroke patients. Therefore, this scientific statement provides an overview on exercise rehabilitation for post-stroke patients.We will use systematic literature reviews, clinical and epidemiology reports, published morbidity and mortality studies, clinical and public health guidelines, patient files, and authoritative statements to support this overview.Evidence clearly supports the use of various kinds of exercise training (e.g., aerobic, strength, flexibility, neuromuscular, and traditional Chinese exercise) for stroke survivors. Aerobic exercise, the main form of cardiac rehabilitation, may play an important role in improving aerobic fitness, cardiovascular fitness, cognitive abilities, walking speed and endurance, balance, quality of life, mobility, and other health outcomes among stroke patients. Strength exercise, included in national stroke guidelines and recommended for general health promotion for stroke survivors, can lead to improvements in functionality, psychosocial aspects, and quality of life for post-stroke patients. Flexibility exercises can relieve muscle spasticity problems, improve motor function, range of motion, and prevent contractures. Stretching exercises can also prevent joint contractures, muscle shortening, decrease spasticity, reduce joint stiffness and improve a post-stroke patient's overall function. Neuromuscular exercises can improve activities of daily living (ADL) through coordination and balance activities. Traditional Chinese exercises are used to improve walking and balance ability as well as increase muscle strength, which is important for post-stroke patients.The present evidence strongly supports the power of exercise for post-stroke patients, which in this study combined aerobic exercises, strength training, flexibility exercises, neuromuscular exercises, and traditional Chinese exercises. This research can encourage post-stroke survivors to consider the importance of exercise in the rehabilitation process.

27195823|t|Traditional Chinese medicines in the management of cardiovascular diseases: a comprehensive systematic review.
27195823|a|AIMS: The aim was to perform a systematic review of the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) in cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched up to 11 November 2015 for all randomized-controlled trials evaluating the effect of TCM in hypertension, ischaemic stroke, heart failure, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Four hypertension studies were eligible for statistical analysis and included 133 patients receiving TCM and 130 control patients. There were significant reductions in systolic blood pressure in patients receiving TCM, comparable to results achieved with pharmaceutical medicines. An OR of 3.781 (95% confidence interval 2.392, 5.977; P = 0.000) was observed for the anti-hypertensive effect of TCM. Significant heterogeneity was present (P = 0.011), with a tendency towards publication bias that did not reach significance (P = 0.05275). Outcome measures for other cardiovascular diseases were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Certain TCM compounds appear to have significant anti-hypertensive effects, and although some are associated in some studies with improved outcomes in coronary heart disease, heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the data are inconsistent and will require large-scale randomized-controlled trials to allow full evaluation of any potential therapeutic benefit in these areas.

28641278|t|Astragaloside-IV Alleviates Heat-Induced Inflammation by Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Autophagy.
28641278|a|BACKGROUND: Thermal injury is the main cause of pulmonary disease in stroke after burn and can be life threatening. Heat-induced inflammation is an important factor that triggers a series of induces pathological changes. However, this mechanism underlying heat-induced inflammation in thermal inhalation injury remains unclear. Studies have revealed that astragaloside-IV (AS-IV), a natural compound extracted from Astragalus membranaceus, has protective effects in inflammatory diseases. Here, we investigated whether the protective effects of AS-IV occur because of the suppression of heat-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and excessive autophagy Methods: AS-IV was administered to Wistar rats after thermal inhalation injury and 16HBE140-cells were treated with AS-IV. TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 levels were determined by ELISA and real-time PCR. ER stress and autophagy were determined by western blot. Autophagic flux was measured by recording the fluorescence emission of the fusion protein mRFP-GFP-LC3 by dynamic live-cell imaging. RESULTS: AS-IV had protective effects against heat-induced reactive oxygen species production and attenuated ER stress. AS IV alleviated heat-induced excessive autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Excessive autophagy was attenuated by the PERK inhibitor GSK2656157 and eIF2α siRNA, suggesting that heat stress-induced autophagy can activate the PERK-eIF2α pathway. Beclin 1 and Atg5 siRNAs inhibited the upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 after heat exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, AS-IV may attenuate inflammatory responses by disrupting the crosstalk between autophagy and the PERK-eIF2α pathway and may be an ideal agent for treating inflammatory pulmonary diseases.

27746410|t|Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Novel Tetramethylpyrazine Derivatives as Potential Neuroprotective Agents.
27746410|a|Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in neurological diseases, resulting in excessive production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) derivatives and investigated their abilities for scavenging free radicals and preventing against oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage in vitro. Among them, compound 22a, consisted of TMP, caffeic acid and a nitrone group, showed potent radical-scavenging activity. Compound 22a had broad neuroprotective effects, including rescuing iodoacetic acid-induced neuronal loss, preventing from tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced neuronal injury. Compound 22a exerted its neuroprotective effect against t-BHP injury via activation of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, compound 22a significantly improved neurological deficits, and alleviated the infarct area and brain edema. In conclusion, our results suggest that compound 22a could be a potential neuroprotective agent for the treatment of neurological disease, particularly ischemic stroke.

28460607|t|A Therapeutic Target of Cerebral Hemorrhagic Stroke: Matrix Metalloproteinase- 9.
28460607|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral hemorrhagic stroke, including intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and hemorrhagic transformation after cerebral infarction, is a major medical emergency in the neurology, neurosurgery, emergency and other clinical departments. The pathophysiological mechanisms of these cerebral hemorrhagic diseases have not been fully elucidated, and there are no effective pharmacological and molecular treatments against these diseases. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), also known as collagenase B, is one of the most important members of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) family. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the role of MMP-9 in the pathogenesis of diseases such as brain hemorrhage, hemorrhagic transformation after cerebral infarction, SAH, and brain injury. RESULTS: The expression levels of MMP-9 in brain tissue increased after cerebral hemorrhage and related to the prognosis of brain hemorrhage. MMP-9 is related to post-thrombolytic hemorrhagic transformation after cerebral infarction. Inhibition of MMP-9 can reduce secondary brain injury after brain hemorrhage. MMP-9 aggravates the early brain injury and cerebral vasospasm after SAH. CONCLUSION: MMP-9 is involved in the pathological process of hemorrhagic stroke through a variety of mechanisms and is closely related to prognosis after cerebral hemorrhagic stroke.

29234386|t|Neuroprotective Effect of Modified Xijiao Dihuang Decoction against Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation and Reoxygenation-Induced Injury in PC12 Cells: Involvement of TLR4-MyD88/NF-κB Signaling Pathway.
29234386|a|Modified Xijiao Dihuang (XJDH) decoction has been shown to exert powerful neuroprotective properties in clinical ischemic stroke treatment. It consists of 4 Chinese herbs: Buffalo Horn, Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews, Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn.) DC, and Paeonia lactiflora Pall. In the present study, the neuroprotective effect and specific mechanisms of XJDH in protecting PC12 cells from oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced injury were investigated. It was found that OGD/R significantly decreased the cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and increased the release of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in PC12 cells, and these effects were suppressed by XJDH and one of its major active constituents, paeoniflorin. Additionally, XJDH inhibited caspase-3 activity and reduced cleaved caspase-3 level. Mechanistic studies showed that the expressions of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, and NF-κB p65 and phosphorylation of IκBα and p65 were significantly lower in the XJDH-treated group than in the OGD/R control group. Additionally, XJDH reversed the OGD/R-induced increases in p-JNK and p-ERK1/2 expression. These results suggest that XJDH protects PC12 cells from oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced injury, which may be associated with the inhibition of the TLR4-MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. As an anti-inflammation factor, XJDH might be used as a neuronal protection strategy for the ischemia injury and related diseases.

29075304|t|Effects of Gualou Guizhi Decoction Aqueous Extract on Axonal Regeneration in Organotypic Cortical Slice Culture after Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation.
29075304|a|Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) is effective for the clinical treatment of limb spasms caused by ischemic stroke, but its underlying mechanism is unclear. Propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL), immunohistochemistry, western blot, and real-time qPCR were used to observe the axonal regeneration and neuroprotective effects of GLGZD aqueous extract on organotypic cortical slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and further elucidate the potential mechanisms. Compared with the OGD group, the GLGZD aqueous extract decreased the red PI fluorescence intensity; inhibited neuronal apoptosis; improved the growth of slice axons; upregulated the protein expression of tau and growth-associated protein-43; and decreased protein and mRNA expression of neurite outgrowth inhibitor protein-A (Nogo-A), Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1), ras homolog gene family A (RhoA), rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK), and phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). Our study found that GLGZD had a strong neuroprotective effect on brain slices after OGD injury. GLGZD plays a vital role in promoting axonal remodeling and functional remodeling, which may be related to regulation of the expression of Nogo-A and its receptor NgR1, near the injured axons, inhibition of the Rho-ROCK pathway, and reduction of CRMP2 phosphorylation.

28473864|t|Activation of AMPK by Buddleja officinalis Maxim. Flower Extract Contributes to Protecting Hepatocytes from Oxidative Stress.
28473864|a|The Buddleja officinalis Maxim. flower is used in traditional Chinese and Korean medicine to treat inflammation, vascular diseases, headache, and stroke, as well as enhance liver function. This research investigated the effects of B. officinalis Maxim. flower extract (BFE) on hepatotoxicity. The cytoprotective effects and mechanism of BFE against severe mitochondrial dysfunction and H2O2 production in hepatotoxicity induced by coadministration of arachidonic acid (AA) and iron were observed in the HepG2 cell line. In addition, we performed blood biochemical, histopathological, and histomorphometric analyses of mice with carbon tetrachloride- (CCl4-) induced acute liver damage. BFE inhibited the AA + iron-mediated hepatotoxicity of HepG2 cells. Moreover, it inhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, H2O2 production, and glutathione depletion mediated by AA + iron in the same cells. Meanwhile, the cytoprotective effects of BFE against oxidative stress were associated with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In particular, based on the histopathological observations, BFE (30 and 100 mg/kg) showed clear hepatoprotective effects against CCl4-induced acute hepatic damage. Furthermore, it inhibited 4-hydroxynonenal and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in hepatocytes. These results provide evidence that BFE has beneficial hepatoprotective effects against hepatic damage via the activation of AMPK pathway. Accordingly, BFE may have therapeutic potential for diverse liver disorders.

28367222|t|The Relationship between Ischemic Stroke Patients with and without Retroflex Tongue: A Retrospective Study.
28367222|a|Background. Patients suffering from stroke exhibit different levels of capability in retroflex tongues, in our clinical observation. This study aims to derive the association of tongue retroflexibility with the degree of severity for stroke patients. Methods. All ischemic stroke patients were collected from August 2010 to July 2013 in the Stroke Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Taiwan. All participants underwent medical history collection and clinical examination, including tongue images captured by ATDS. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the differences of ischemic stroke patients with and without retroflex tongue. Result. Among the total of 308 cases collected, 123 patients cannot retroflex their tongues, that is, the non-RT group. The length of stay in the non-RT group, 32.0 ± 21.5, was longer than those of the RT counterparts, 25.9 ± 14.4 (p value: 0.007). The NIHSS on admission, 14.1 ± 7.8 versus 8.9 ± 5.2, was higher and the Barthel Index upon admission, 18.6 ± 20.7 and 35.0 ± 24.2, was lower for the non-RT patients than that of the RT counterparts. Also, the non-RT patients account for 60.2% and 75.6% for Barthel Index ≤ 17 and NIHSS ≥ 9, respectively. Conclusion. The stroke patients in non-RT group showed significantly poor prognosis and were more serious in the degree of severity and level of autonomy than RT group, indicating that the ability to maneuver tongue retroflex can serve as a simple, reliable, and noninvasive means for the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients.

28243308|t|Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.
28243308|a|Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, which is related to many cardiac and cerebral vascular diseases, especially stroke. It can therefore increase cardiovascular mortality and all-cause death. The current treatments of AF remain to be western drugs and radiofrequency ablation which are limited by the tolerance of patients, adverse side effects, and high recurrence rate, especially for the elderly. On the contrary, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with long history of use involves various treatment methods, including Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) or bioactive ingredients, Chinese patent medicines, acupuncture, Qigong, and Tai Chi Chuan. With more and more researches reported, the active roles of TCM in AF management have been discovered. Then it is likely that TCM would be effective preventive means and valuable additional remedy for AF. The potential mechanisms further found by numerous experimental studies showed the distinct characteristics of TCM. Some CHMs or bioactive ingredients are atrial-selective, while others are multichannel and multifunctional. Therefore, in this review we summarized the treatment strategies reported in TCM, with the purpose of providing novel ideas and directions for AF management.

27412923|t|Interankle Systolic Blood Pressure Difference Is a Marker of Prevalent Stroke in Chinese Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study.
27412923|a|This cross-sectional study carried out from November 2014 to December 2014 aimed to determine whether the interankle systolic blood pressure (SBP) difference is an independent marker of prevalent stroke. Simultaneous four-limb blood pressure measurements (oscillometric devices) and calculated SBP difference between the lower limbs were collected from 1485 participants aged 35 years and older. Questionnaires about traditional stroke risk factors were completed. Interankle SBP difference ≥7 mm Hg was independently associated with a history of stroke after adjusting for traditional stroke risk factors (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-3.59; P=.0123). Net reclassification improvement analysis showed that adding the interankle SBP difference to traditional risk factors improved the predictive ability for stroke risk by 18.5% (P<.001). In conclusion, an interankle SBP difference ≥7 mm Hg could be an independent marker of stroke history in Chinese adults. It could offer an extra benefit in identifying individuals with risk of stroke beyond conventional clinical features.

28502499|t|Effects of statin therapy on cerebrovascular and renal outcomes in patients with predialysis advanced chronic kidney disease and dyslipidemia.
28502499|a|BACKGROUND: Treatment with statin may be beneficial for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the debate over the clinical importance of statin in patients with predialysis advanced CKD remains unresolved. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the article was to evaluate the effect of statin on mortality, cerebrovascular, and renal outcomes in patients with predialysis advanced CKD and dyslipidemia. METHODS: Data on predialysis advanced CKD patients were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database based on the guidelines for prescribing regular erythropoietin-stimulating agent in CKD patients. Patients with dyslipidemia were further selected and divided into 2 groups by their statin use after the prescribed erythropoietin-stimulating agent. All-cause mortality and cerebrovascular and renal outcomes were analyzed after propensity score matching. RESULTS: There were 2016 and 14,412 patients in the statin and nonstatin groups. Their average follow-up periods were 3.7 and 3.0 years, respectively. After 1:2 propensity score matching, the annual all-cause mortality rate was higher in the nonstatin than in the statin group (143.99 vs 109.50 per 1000 person-years; P < .001; hazard ratio: 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.68-080). The annual risk of ischemic stroke (P = .186) and intracranial hemorrhage (P = .322) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The nonstatin group had a higher risk of dialysis than the statin group (1269.45 vs 1095.00 per 1000 person-years; P = .002). Adverse events were not significant between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Statins may reduce the all-cause mortality and reduced the risk of dialysis in patients with predialysis advanced CKD and dyslipidemia. However, statins have no impact on ischemic-hemorrhage stroke.

26754351|t|Clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with duration of type 2 diabetes >40 years.
26754351|a|BACKGROUND: Although type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) shortens life expectancy by 10-12 years, some patients survive extremely long durations of diabetes. The clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with >40 years T2DM remain unknown. Thus, the aim of the present study was to document the clinical profile of patients with T2DM for ≥40 years. METHODS: The present study evaluated 157 survivors with >40 years T2DM from a total of 582 773 patients with T2DM enrolled in a Chinese national survey of HbA1c. Two matched case-control studies were performed on long T2DM survivors (cases) separately matched according to: (1) survey day, sex, and survey hospital; and (2) age, sex, and survey hospital. Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for long survival. RESULTS: Patients with a long duration of T2DM had a mean (± SD) age of 75 ± 10 years. Their T2DM had been diagnosed at a mean age of 32 years and the median duration of diabetes was 41 years. In both case-control studies, long-duration T2DM was associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia (OR 6.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-21.09) and coronary heart disease (CHD; OR 2.18 95% CI 1.01-4.70). However, long-duration T2DM was not associated with a higher likelihood of abnormal lipids, diabetic nephropathy (DN), or stroke compared with patients with a shorter duration of T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that Chinese patients with long-term T2DM also had increased risks of hyperglycemia and non-fatal CHD. Further studies are needed to investigate whether survival of these patients was associated with non-increased risk of DN.

28203406|t|Effects of recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide on the prognosis of patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention: a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial.
28203406|a|BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the effects of recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide (rhBNP) on serum enzyme data, cardiac function parameters and cardiovascular events in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: A total of 421 patients with acute anterior or extensive anterior MI were collected from 20 hospitals. These patients were randomly divided into two groups: rhBNP and control groups. Both groups of patients received primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within the effective time window. In the rhBNP group, rhBNP administration (0.01 µg/kg/min, 48-72 successive hours) was performed as early as possible after hospital admission. Prior to and one or seven days after PCI, serum concentrations of cardiac troponin (cTnT), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured. At seven days and 6 months after PCI, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd) and stroke volume (SV) were measured using 2D Doppler echocardiography. MACEs that occurred during hospitalization and within 6 months after PCI were recorded. RESULTS: At postoperative days one and seven, serum concentrations of cTnT were significantly lower in the rhBNP group than in the control group. At postoperative day one, serum concentrations of CK-MB were significantly lower in the rhBNP group than in the control group. At postoperative day seven, serum concentrations of NT-proBNP were significantly lower in the rhBNP group than in the control group, and LVEF was significantly greater in the rhBNP group than in the control group. At postoperative 6 months, LVEDd was significantly lower in the rhBNP group compared with the control group. In addition, SV and LVEF were significantly greater in the rhBNP group than in the control group. By postoperative month 6, the incidence of composite cardiovascular events (16.0% vs. 26.0%, P=0.012), cardiac death (7.0% vs.13.5%, P=0.030), and particularly cardiac death + re-hospitalization for congestive heart failure (13.1% vs. 25.5%, P=0.001) were significantly lower in the rhBNP group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Early intravenous rhBNP administration after PCI significantly lowered the serum concentrations of cTnT and NT-proBNP, increased LVEDd, SV and LVEF, and reduced MACEs, including cardiac death, in patients with acute anterior MI undergoing PCI.

28071000|t|Chemical composition and antioxidant activities of essential oils from different parts of the oregano.
28071000|a|This research was undertaken in order to characterize the chemical compositions and evaluate the antioxidant activities of essential oils obtained from different parts of the Origanum vulgare L. It is a medicinal plant used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of heat stroke, fever, vomiting, acute gastroenteritis, and respiratory disorders. The chemical compositions of the three essential oils from different parts of the oregano (leaves-flowers, stems, and roots) were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antioxidant activity of each essential oil was assessed using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay and reducing the power test. Among the essential oils from different parts of the oregano, the leaf-flower oils have the best antioxidant activities, whereas the stem oils are the worst. The results of the DPPH free radical scavenging assay showed that the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of the essential oils were (0.332±0.040) mg/ml (leaves-flowers), (0.357±0.031) mg/ml (roots), and (0.501±0.029) mg/ml (stems), respectively. Interestingly, the results of reducing the power test also revealed that when the concentration exceeded 1.25 mg/ml, the leaf-flower oils had the highest reducing power; however, the stem oils were the lowest.

28072733|t|Efficacy and safety of puerarin injection in curing acute ischemic stroke: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
28072733|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicated that the puerarin injection has been widely employed in China for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the puerarin injection for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in PUBMED, EMBASE, SPRINGER LINK, Scopus, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP Journals Database, Wanfang database and the China Biological Medicine database before November 2016, randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of puerarin injection treating acute ischemic stroke were included. In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant retrieved articles. Two authors extracted data independently. The effective rate, the neurologic deficit score, the blood rheology indexes, and fibrinogen were assessed and analyzed by the Review Manager 5.3 software. The continuous variables were expressed as MD with 95% CI and dichotomous data used RR or ORs. Adverse reactions related to the puerarin injection were also examined. RESULTS: Thirty-five RCTs with a total of 3224 participants were identified in the meta-analysis. The combined results of 32 trials indicated that the puerarin injection was better than control drugs at the clinical effective rate (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.28, P < 0.001) and 16 studies showed the neurological deficit was significantly improved (MD -3.69, 95% CI -4.67 to -2.71, P < 0.001); the hemorheology index and fibrinogen were much lower with the puerarin injection when compared with western conventional medicines (WCM) or other control drugs (the whole blood viscosity: MD -0.89, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.41, P < 0.001; the HCT: MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02, P < 0.001; the fibrinogen: MD -0.64, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.31, P < 0.001). Eleven trials reported that the adverse reactions related to the puerarin injection included facial flushing, dizziness, vomiting, nausea, and other mild gastrointestinal discomfort and allergic reaction. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Puerarin injection may be more effective and relatively safe in clinic for treating acute ischemic stroke. However, the current evidence is insufficient due to the poor methodological quality and lack of adequate safety data. Further RCTs are required to examine its efficacy.

26742528|t|Upregulating the Expression of Survivin-HBXIP Complex Contributes to the Protective Role of IMM-H004 in Transient Global Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion.
26742528|a|IMM-H004, a 3-piperazinylcoumarin compound derived from coumarin, has been proved effective against CA1 cell loss and spatial learning impairments resulting from transient global ischemia/reperfusion (TGCI/R), while the mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, we confirmed that treatment of rats with IMM-H004 immediately after TGCI/R ameliorated delayed neuronal death (DND) in the CA1 of hippocampus and cortex. Further study suggested that IMM-H004 contributed to the expression of antiapoptotic protein survivin through the activation of PI3K-dependent protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which led to the phosphorylation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), then relieved the inhibiting effect on survivin promoter. Additionally, IMM-H004 also enhanced the expression of hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP), which formed a complex with survivin to prevent the activation of caspase death cascade, thereby halting apoptotic cell death. Finally, we injected a HBXIP siRNA into hippocampus and performed microelectroporation before ischemia/reperfusion, which abolished the protective effect of IMM-H004. Further study revealed that HBXIP maintained the high expression of Akt and survivin. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that DND after TGCI/R was alleviated by IMM-H004 through promoting the formation of survivin-HBXIP complex, which further emphasized the importance of endogenous protein involved in self-repair after stroke.

27738712|t|Oleoylethanolamide attenuates apoptosis by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in mice with acute ischemic stroke.
27738712|a|This study was carried out to investigate the exact mechanisms behind the neuroprotective effects of oleoylethanolamide (OEA) after acute cerebral ischemic injury. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min followed by reperfusion. OEA (40 mg/kg, ip) was administered with a single injection upon reperfusion. The number of apoptotic cells was detected by TUNEL staining. The expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and TLR4, as well as the activities of NF-κB, Akt, and ERK1/2 were analyzed by western blot. Our data showed that OEA treatment alleviated cell apoptosis in a mouse model of ischemic stroke, accompanied by suppression of Bax, as well as upregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 level. The changes of Bax and Bcl-2 could not be observed in PPARα knockout mice models with OEA administration. Importantly, OEA inhibited MCAO-induced TLR4 expression, NF-κB activation, IκBα degradation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of OEA on cerebral ischemia may be attributed to its antiapoptotic property achieved, at least in part, through the PPARα signaling and inhibition of both TLR4/NF-κB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. These results provide new evidence indicating the neuroprotective effect of OEA on ischemic stroke.

29375914|t|Longitudinal Brain Functional Connectivity Changes of the Cortical Motor-Related Network in Subcortical Stroke Patients with Acupuncture Treatment.
29375914|a|In clinical practice, the effectiveness of the rehabilitation therapy such as acupuncture combining conventional Western medicine (AG) on stroke people's motor-related brain network and their behaviors has not been systematically studied. In the present study, seventeen adult ischemic patients were collected and divided into two groups: the conventional Western medicine treatment group (CG) and the AG. The neurological deficit scores (NDS) and resting-state functional MRI data were collected before and after treatment. Compared with the CG patients, AG patients exhibited a significant enhancement of the percent changes of NDS from pre- to posttreatment intervention. All patients showed significant changes of functional connectivity (FC) between the pair of cortical motor-related regions. After treatment, both patient groups showed a recovery of brain connectivity to the nearly normal level compared with the controls in these pairs. Moreover, a significant correlation between the percent changes of NDS and the pretreatment FC values of bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) in all patients was found. In conclusion, our results showed that AG therapy can be an effective means for ischemic stroke patients to recover their motor function ability. The FC strengths between bilateral M1 of stroke patients can predict stroke patients' treatment outcome after rehabilitation therapy.

28293438|t|Neuroplasticity Changes on Human Motor Cortex Induced by Acupuncture Therapy: A Preliminary Study.
28293438|a|While neuroplasticity changes measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation have been proved to be highly correlated to motor recovery and have been tested in various forms of interventions, it has not been applied to investigate the neurophysiologic mechanism of acupuncture therapy. The aim of this study is to investigate neuroplasticity changes induced by a single session of acupuncture therapy in healthy adults, regarding the excitability change on bilateral primary motor cortex and interhemispheric inhibition. Ten subjects took a 30-minute acupuncture therapy and the same length relaxing phase in separate days. Transcranial magnetic stimulation measures, including resting motor threshold, amplitudes of motor-evoked potential, and interhemispheric inhibition, were assessed before and 10 minutes after intervention. Acupuncture treatment showed significant changes on potential amplitude from both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres to acupuncture compared to baseline. Also, interhemispheric inhibition from the contralateral motor cortex to the opposite showed a significant decline. The results indicated that corticomotoneuronal excitability and interhemispheric competition could be modulated by acupuncture therapy on healthy subjects. The following question about whether these changes will be observed in the same way on stroke patients and whether they correlate with the therapeutic effect on movement need to be answered by following studies. This trial is registered with ISRCTN13074245.

28116173|t|Electroacupuncture Regulates Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity via miR-134-Mediated LIMK1 Function in Rats with Ischemic Stroke.
28116173|a|MircoRNAs (miRs) have been implicated in learning and memory, by regulating LIM domain kinase (LIMK1) to induce synaptic-dendritic plasticity. The study aimed to investigate whether miRNAs/LIMK1 signaling was involved in electroacupuncture- (EA-) mediated synaptic-dendritic plasticity in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion induced cognitive deficit (MICD). Compared to untreatment or non-acupoint-EA treatment, EA at DU20 and DU24 acupoints could shorten escape latency and increase the frequency of crossing platform in Morris water maze test. T2-weighted imaging showed that the MICD rat brain lesions were located in cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum, and thalamus regions and injured volumes were reduced after EA. Furthermore, we found that the density of dendritic spine and the number of synapses in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were obviously reduced at Day 14 after MICD. However, synaptic-dendritic loss could be rescued after EA. Moreover, the synaptic-dendritic plasticity was associated with increases of the total LIMK1 and phospho-LIMK1 levels in hippocampal CA1 region, wherein EA decreased the expression of miR-134, negatively regulating LIMK1 to enhance synaptic-dendritic plasticity. Therefore, miR-134-mediated LIMK1 was involved in EA-induced hippocampal synaptic plasticity, which served as a contributor to improving learning and memory during the recovery stage of ischemic stroke.

27796172|t|Risk factors between intracranial-extracranial atherosclerosis and anterior-posterior circulation stroke in ischaemic stroke.
27796172|a|OBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis is an important cause of stroke and remains a challenge for stroke prevention. Risk factors involved in atherosclerotic stroke and anterior and posterior circulation strokes (ACS and PCS, respectively) are different. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in risk factors between intracranial and extracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS and ECAS), ACS and PCS, and ICAS/ECAS with ACS/PCS in a Chinese acute ischaemic stroke population. METHODS: We analysed 551 ischaemic stroke patients who had been enrolled between August 2005 and July 2008. First, risk factors were compared between non-atherosclerosis, ICAS, ECAS, and combined ICAS and ECAS groups. ICAS and ECAS were assessed with transcranial Doppler and carotid colour Doppler ultrasound, respectively. Second, risk factors were compared between ACS and PCS groups. Stroke lesion was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. Third, risk factors were compared in ICAS/ECAS associated with ACS/PCS. RESULTS: The risk factor for ICAS was high diastolic blood pressure (OR, 1.075; 95% CI, 1.016-1.138; p = 0.013), and the risk factors for ECAS were age (OR, 1.113; 95% CI, 1.046-1.183; p = 0.001) and low density lipoprotein (OR, 1.450; 95% CI, 1.087-1.935; p = 0.012). Hypertension (OR, 1.090; 95% CI, 1.001-1.109; p = 0.027) was associated with PCS. Age (OR, 1.026; 95% CI, 1.011-1.128; p = 0.003), male gender (OR, 2.278; 95% CI, 1.481-3.258; p = 0.003) and age (OR, 1.067; 95% CI, 1.013-1.123; p = 0.014), scores of NIHSS (OR, 1.069; 95% CI, 1.012-1.130; p = 0.018) were risk factors for ICAS and ECAS with ACS, respectively. CONCLUSION: Risk factors are different between ICAS and ECAS, ACS and PCS, and ICAS/ECAS with ACS/PCS. Thus, targeted strategies are needed to consider these differences to prevent, treat and manage these diseases.

29317985|t|Polyphenols and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerosis-Related Ischemic Heart Disease and Stroke.
29317985|a|Good nutrition could maintain health and life. Polyphenols are common nutrient mainly derived from fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, cocoa, mushrooms, beverages, and traditional medicinal herbs. They are potential substances against oxidative-related diseases, for example, cardiovascular disease, specifically, atherosclerosis-related ischemic heart disease and stroke, which are health and economic problems recognized worldwide. In this study, we reviewed the risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and cigarette smoking as well as the antioxidative activity of polyphenols, which could prevent the pathology of atherosclerosis, including endothelial dysfunction, low-density lipoprotein oxidation, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, inflammatory process by monocytes, macrophages or T lymphocytes, and platelet aggregation. The strong radical-scavenging properties of polyphenols would exhibit antioxidative and anti-inflammation effects. Polyphenols reduce ROS production by inhibiting oxidases, reducing the production of superoxide, inhibiting OxLDL formation, suppressing VSMC proliferation and migration, reducing platelet aggregation, and improving mitochondrial oxidative stress. Polyphenol consumption also inhibits the development of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Despite the numerous in vivo and in vitro studies, more advanced clinical trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy of polyphenols in the treatment of atherosclerosis-related vascular diseases.

28894512|t|Treatment Effects of Ischemic Stroke by Berberine, Baicalin, and Jasminoidin from Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) Explored by an Integrated Metabolomics Approach.
28894512|a|Berberine, baicalin, and jasminoidin were major active ingredients of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD), a famous prescription of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which has been used for the treatment of ischemic stroke. The aim of the present study was to classify their roles in the treatment effects of ischemic stroke. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was constructed to mimic ischemic stroke and treatment effects of berberine, baicalin, and jasminoidin, and HLJDD was assessed by neurologic deficit scoring, infarct volume, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and Western blotting. In addition, the 1H NMR metabolomics approach was used to assess the metabolic profiles, which combined with correlation network analysis successfully revealed metabolic disorders in ischemic stroke concerning the treatment of the three principal compounds from HLJDD for the first time. The combined results suggested that berberine, baicalin, and jasminoidin are responsible for the effectiveness of HLJDD on the treatment of ischemic stroke by amelioration of abnormal metabolism and regulation of oxidative stress, neuron autophagy, and inflammatory response. This integrated metabolomics approach showed its potential in understanding the function of complex formulae and clarifying the role of its components in the overall treatment effects.

27762458|t|Role of Medicinal Plants for Liver-Qi Regulation Adjuvant Therapy in Post-stroke Depression: A Systematic Review of Literature.
27762458|a|Current evidence demonstrated certain beneficial effects of medicinal herbs as an adjuvant therapy for post-stroke depression (PSD) in China; Chai-hu (Chinese Thorowax Root, Radix Bupleuri) is an example of a medicinal plant for Liver-Qi regulation (MPLR) in the treatment of PSD. Despite several narrative reports on the antidepressant properties of MPLR, it appears that there are no systematic reviews to summarize its outcome effects. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of MPLR adjuvant therapy in patients with PSD. Seven databases were extensively searched from January 2000 until July 2016. Randomized control trials (RCTs) involving patients with PSD that compared treatment with and without MPLR were taken into account. The pooled effect estimates were calculated based on Cochrane Collaboration's software RevMan 5.3. Finally, 42 eligible studies with 3612 participants were included. Overall, MPLR adjuvant therapy showed a significantly higher effective rate (RR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.19, 1.27; p < 0.00001) compared to those without. Moreover, the administration of MPLR was superior to abstainers regarding Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score changes after 3 weeks (WMD = -4.83; 95% CI = -6.82, -2.83; p < 0.00001), 4 weeks (WMD = -3.25; 95% CI = -4.10, -2.40; p < 0.00001), 6 weeks (WMD = -4.04; 95% CI = -5.24, -2.84; p < 0.00001), 8 weeks (WMD = -4.72; 95% CI = -5.57, -3.87; p < 0.00001), and 12 weeks (WMD = -3.07; 95% CI = -4.05, -2.09; p < 0.00001). In addition, there were additive benefits in terms of response changes for the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and other self-rating scores. No frequently occurring or serious adverse events were reported. We concluded that there is supporting evidence that adjuvant therapy with MPLR is effective in reducing the depressive symptoms and enhancing quality of life for patients with PSD. More well-designed RCTs are necessary to explore the role of MPLR in the treatment of PSD. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

28160212|t|Phthalides: Distribution in Nature, Chemical Reactivity, Synthesis, and Biological Activity.
28160212|a|Phthalides are a relatively small group of natural compounds confined to several plant families and some genera of fungi and liverworts. They are divided into two structural groups, the monomeric and dimeric phthalides, and known mainly as bioactive constituents of different plant species used traditionally for medicinal purposes in Asia, Europe, and North America.The first reports on the chemistry of phthalides appeared at the end of the nineteenth century, in which they were identified as the odor constituents of the essential oil of celery (Apium graveolens) by Ciamician and Silber (1897). In the first half of the last century, phthalides were isolated from Cnidium officinale and Ligusticum acutilobum, species widely used in Asian traditional medicine, and from Levisticum officinale, a species used as food and condiment. Throughout the second part of the twentieth century, phthalides have been characterized from several plant families, namely Asteraceae, Leguminosae, Orchidaceae and Rutaceae, among others, but mainly from the Umbelliferae (syn Apiaceae) family, and the major contributors have been the following species used in traditional medicine: Ligusticum chuanxiong (Chinese name: Chuanxiong), Angelica sinensis (Chinese name: Danggui), Cnidium officinale (Japanese name: Senkyu), Angelica acutiloba (Japanese name: Toki), and Ligusticum porteri (Hispanic name: Oshá). Phthalides are also constituents of several genera of fungi, such as Penicillium, Alternaria and Pestalotiopsis, and some liverworts.Different chromatographic, spectrometric, and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have been used for the isolation and structural characterization of phthalides in extracts, and for assessing the quality of plant material containing this type of compound. Isotopic labeling has established the biosynthesis of phthalides via linkage of acetate units forming polyketide intermediates.Chemical transformations of monomeric phthalides have included oxidation, reduction, addition, elimination, and cycloaddition reactions, and treatments with Lewis acids of (Z)-ligustilide have afforded linear dimers. Some intramolecular condensations and differentiated cyclizations of the dimeric phthalides have been carried out, providing evidences for the particular chemical reactivity of these compounds.Several structural modifications of phthalides have been carried out subjecting them to microbial transformations by different species of bacteria, fungi and algae, and these included resolutions of racemic mixtures and oxidations, among others.The [π4s + π2s] and [π2s + π2s] cycloadditions of (Z)-ligustilide for the synthesis of dimeric phthalides have been reported, and different approaches involving cyclizations, Alder-Rickert reactions, Sharpless asymmetric hydroxylations, or Grignard additions have been used for the synthesis of monomeric phthalides. The use of phthalides as building blocks for divergent oriented synthesis has been proven.Many of the naturally occurring phthalides display different biological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory effects, among many others, with a considerable recent research on the topic. In the case of compounds isolated from the Apiaceae, the bioactivities correlate with the traditional medicinal uses of the natural sources. Some monomeric phthalides have shown their ability to attenuate certain neurological diseases, including stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.The present contribution covers the distribution of phthalides in nature and the findings in the structural diversity, chemical reactivity, biotransformations, syntheses, and bioactivity of natural and semisynthetic phthalides.

29071893|t|[Influence of Electroacupuncture Intervention on Glutamic Acid and Ca2+ Contents and Expression of NMDA Receptor Protein in Hippocampus in Vascular Dementia Rats].
29071893|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of electroacupuncture (EA) intervention on hippocampal glutamate (Glu) and Ca2+ contents, and expression of Glu-N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor(NMDAR) and the learning-memory ability in vascular dementia (VD) rats, so as to reveal its mechanisms underlying improvement of VD. METHODS: SD rats were rando-mized into sham operation (sham) group (n=9), model group (n=11) and EA groups (n=10). The VD model was established by repeated bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion and reperfusion plus intraperitoneal injection of sodium nitroprusside. EA (2 Hz, 2 mA) was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20)-"Housanli" (ST 36) and "Geshu" (BL 17)-"Dazhui" (GV 14) for 10 min, once a day for 15 consecutive days. The neurological function was assessed by using stroke index (0-10 points) and neurological deficit scaling(0-10 points). The learning-memory ability was evaluated by using step-down tests. The contents of Glu and Ca2+ in the right hippocampal tissue were determined by using aspectrophotometer and the expression of NMDAR protein in the right hippocampus was detected by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, the stroke index and neurological deficit scores, and the reaction latency and the error times of step-down tests, as well as the contents of Glu and Ca2+ and the expression level of NMDAR in the right hippocampus were significantly increased in the model group (P<0.05, P<0.01), while the step-through latency was considerably decreased (P<0.01), suggesting a neurological disorder and a cognitive decline. After EA intervention, the reaction latency and error times of step-down tests, the contents of Glu and Ca2+ and the expression level of NMDAR in the right hippocampus were significantly down-regulated, and the step-through latency was notably increased in comparison with the model group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: EA intervention is able to improve the cognitive ability of VD rats, which may be associated with its effects in reducing the excitatory neurotoxicity of hippocampal Glu-NMDAR and lowering cellular Ca2+ load to resist neuronal injury.

29071888|t|[Effect of Acupuncture on Neurological Function and Related Differentially-depressed Profiles in the Brain of Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Rats Using Antibody Chips Technique].
29071888|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of acupuncture on changes of neurological function and expression of proteins in the ischemic brain region in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats with protein chip technique, so as to reveal the profiles of cerebral proteins related to its effectiveness in improving cerebral ischemia (CI). METHODS: SD rats were rando-mized into sham operation (sham), CI model, non-acupoint and acupoint groups (n=10 in each group). The CI model was established by MCAO according to modified Longa's method. For rats of the acupoint group, "Dazhui" (CV 14), "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Shuigou" (GV 26) were punctured by twirling the filiform needles for about 1 min, and repeated once again during 30 min of need-le retention, which was conducted once every 12 h, and 6 times altogether. The non-acupoints were about 3 mm away from the above-mentioned acupoints and stimulated with the same method and same procedures. The neurological deficit score was scaled according to Longa's method. The differentially-expressed proteins (≥ 1.5 folds in up- and down-regulation) in the ischemic region of the brain were detected by using Springbio 720 antibody chip technology. RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, the neurological deficit score was significantly higher in the model group (P<0.01), while compared with the model group, the neurological deficit scores were considerably in both acupoint and non-acupoint groups (P<0.05, P<0.01). The therapeutic effect of acupoint group was evidently superior to that of the non-acupoint group in improving neurological function (P<0.05). Compared with the sham group, the differentially-expressed proteins in the ischemic brain including 33 up-regulated and 12 down-regulated were found in the model group, mainly functioning in cell apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, cell differentiation and proliferation, cell cytoskeleton and connection, cell signal transduction, DNA repair and transcription factors. Compared with the model group, the differentially-expressed proteins including 12 up-regulated and 31 down-regulated in the acupoint group, and 15 up-regu-lated and 17 down-regulated in the non-acupoint group were detected, functioning being the same as those mentioned above in the model group. CONCLUSIONS: Manual acupuncture stimulation of GV 14, GV 20 and GV 26 can improve neurological function in CI rats, which may be associated with its function in regulating the expression of many proteins in the ischemic region of the brain.

27833029|t|BDNF/PI3K/Akt and Nogo-A/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathways contribute to neurorestorative effect of Houshiheisan against cerebral ischemia injury in rats.
27833029|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Houshiheisan (HSHS), a classic traditional medicine prescription, has notable effects on patients with stroke AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the neurorestorative effects of HSHS on ischemic stroke and explore its mode of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia models were induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 5 experimental groups: sham vehicle, ischemia vehicle, pMCAO+HSHS at 5.1, 10.2g/kg, and pMCAO+Ginaton 0.028g/kg. HSHS or Ginaton was administrated 6h after pMCAO onset. Neurological function was assessed and then rats were sacrificed 7 days after MCAO. Cerebral ischemic injury was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) immunofluorescence analysis. The levels of BDNF were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the expression levels of PI3K/Akt and Nogo-A/RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway were detected by western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Compared with those results of pMCAO group, HSHS 5.1 and HSHS 10.2 groups markedly improved neurological function, alleviated pathological damage, promoted the neuronal survival, increased the expression of BDNF, PI3K, Akt, in protein and mRNA, decreased the expression of Nogo-A, NgR, RhoA and ROCK2 in protein and mRNA 7 days after pMCAO. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that HSHS had significant therapeutic effects on ischemic stroke and it perhaps worked through the activation of BDNF/PI3K/Akt and down-regulation of Nogo-A/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathways.

27773802|t|Effects of the traditional Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus in patients with poststroke fatigue: A double-blind, randomized, controlled preliminary study.
27773802|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Astragalus membranaceus (AM) is the first-choice herb for fatigue treatment in traditional Chinese medicine and the main herb used for stroke treatment in China and Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of AM on poststroke fatigue (PSF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, controlled preliminary study. Sixty-four patients with PSF were assigned to treatment group (TG; 31 patients), which received oral administration of AM (2.8g three times per day) for 28 days, and a control group (CG; 33 patients), which received a placebo. The primary outcome measures were the changes in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Brief Fatigue Index (BFI) scores RESULTS: A total of 61 patients (29 patients in the TG and 32 patients in the CG) completed the trial. The difference in BFI scores between Visit 2 and Visit 1 was -17.83±17.70 in the TG, which was greater than that in the CG (-8.03±9.95; p=0.01); additionally, the difference in BFI scores between Visit 3 and Visit 1 was -16.48±16.41 in the TG, which was also greater than that in the CG (-9.47±13.39; p=0.05). In the EORTC QLQ-C30, the difference in cognitive functioning scores between Visit 2 and Visit 1 was 14.37±13.89 in the TG, which was greater than that in the CG (3.65±19.74; p=0.02); additionally, the difference in these scores between Visit 3 and Visit 1 was 14.37±16.50 in the TG, which again was greater than that in the CG (6.25±19.74; p=0.04). The difference in social functioning scores between Visit 3 and Visit 1 was 9.77±15.12 in the TG, which was greater than that in the CG (-1.56±20.46; p=0.01). The difference in global quality of life (QOL) scores between Visit 2 and Visit 1 was 14.08±18.78 in the TG, which was also greater than that in the CG (1.56±18.14; p=0.003); moreover, the difference in these scores between Visit 3 and Visit 1 was 10.92±17.55 in the TG, and this was greater than that in the CG (1.82±15.8; p=0.05). CONCLUSION: AM can improve BFI scores; cognitive functioning, social functioning, and global QOL scores in the EORTC QLQ-C30. Our results suggest that physicians should pay close attention to the unmet medical needs of patients with PSF. AM is helpful for treating patients with PSF; however, additional studies with a larger sample and a longer period of investigation are required.

27771457|t|Identification of NF-κB inhibitors following Shenfu injection and bioactivity-integrated UPLC/Q-TOF-MS and screening for related anti-inflammatory targets in vitro and in silico.
27771457|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shenfu injection (SFI) is a commercial medicinal product approved by the China Food and Drug Administration that is widely used in the treatment of stroke and coronary heart disease. However, the material basis and the mechanism of SFI are not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: With network pharmacology analysis, our research committed to identify the anti-inflammatory ingredients and mechanism of SFI by combining high-throughput screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a bioactivity-based UPLC/Q-TOF-MS method followed by network pharmacology and identified the anti-inflammatory active ingredients of SFI from two different perspectives of network computing and high throughput screening. Then we verified the anti-inflammatory effect of SFI in vitro with endothelial cells. After detecting the cell viability, the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKK), phosphorylated IKK, phosphorylated NF-κB and phosphorylated IκB-α from the supernatant were determined. RESULTS: SFI could significantly suppress inflammatory responses, and the mechanism may be via an NF-κB-dependent pathway. The results of high throughput screening (HTS) revealed that protopanaxadiol glycosides (ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc and Rd), protopanaxatriol glycosides (ginsenosides Rg1, Rg2, Re, Rf and F1), diester-type alkaloids (fuziline and neoline) and aconine derivatives (mesaconine and benzoyl-mesaconine) have anti-NF-κB activity. The three compounds (including benzoyl-mesaconine, fuziline and neoline) are the first reported SFI compounds to have NF-κB inhibitor activity. CONCLUSIONS: SFI may play a critical role in counteracting inflammation through the NF-κB signaling pathway. The active ingredients are protopanaxadiol glycosides, protopanaxatriol glycosides, diester-type alkaloids and aconine derivatives.

27729283|t|Locally and traditionally used Ligusticum species - A review of their phytochemistry, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics.
27729283|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ligusticum species (Umbelliferae) have been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine, Korean folk medicine and Native American medicine for their medicinal and nutritional value. Decoctions of the rhizomes are used in treatment and prophylaxis of migraine, anemia and cardiovascular conditions including stroke. AIM OF STUDY: This review is intended to fully compile the constituents of locally and traditionally used Ligusticum species, present their bioactivities and highlight potential leads for future drug design, and thus, provide a reference for further research and application of these species. Emphasis is also placed on current trends in the pharmacokinetic studies of the major constituents. METHODS: The literature discussed is derived from readily accessible papers spanning the early 1990s to the end of 2015. Information was collected from journals, books and online searches (Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, SciFinder, Springerlink and CNKI). RESULTS: The major phytoconstituents, 154 of which are presented in this review, include alkaloids, phthalides and phenolic acids. The crude extracts and isolated constituents have exhibited a wide range of in vitro and in vivo pharmacologic effects, including cardioprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. The bioactive alkaloid tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) has attracted the most attention for its potent effect on calcium channels, anti-platelet as well as anti-inflammatory effects. Pharmacokinetic studies of major constituents have also been summarized. CONCLUSION: The pthalides, organic acids and alkaloids of Ligusticum species have emerged as a good source of traditional medicines for the management of cardio- and cerebrovascular conditions, inflammation and neurogenerative disorders. The species discussed in this review have demonstrated wide pharmacological actions and have great potential to yield multipotent drugs if challenges such as poor bioavailability, solubility and toxicological profiles are addressed. Apart from the rhizomes, pharmacological activities of other botanical parts also need to be studied further. Expansion of research to cover other species in the Ligusticum genus would provide more opportunities for the discovery of new bioactive principles.

27929069|t|Th1 cells downregulate connexin 43 gap junctions in astrocytes via microglial activation.
27929069|a|We previously reported early and extensive loss of astrocytic connexin 43 (Cx43) in acute demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Because it is widely accepted that autoimmune T cells initiate MS lesions, we hypothesized that infiltrating T cells affect Cx43 expression in astrocytes, which contributes to MS lesion formation. Primary mixed glial cell cultures were prepared from newborn mouse brains, and microglia were isolated by anti-CD11b antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. Next, we prepared astrocyte-rich cultures and astrocyte/microglia-mixed cultures. Treatment of primary mixed glial cell cultures with interferon (IFN) γ, interleukin (IL)-4, or IL-17 showed that only IFNγ or IL-17 at high concentrations reduced Cx43 protein levels. Upon treatment of astrocyte-rich cultures and astrocyte/microglia-mixed cultures with IFNγ, Cx43 mRNA/protein levels and the function of gap junctions were reduced only in astrocyte/microglia-mixed cultures. IFNγ-treated microglia-conditioned media and IL-1β, which was markedly increased in IFNγ-treated microglia-conditioned media, reduced Cx43 protein levels in astrocyte-rich cultures. Finally, we confirmed that Th1 cell-conditioned medium decreased Cx43 protein levels in mixed glial cell cultures. These findings suggest that Th1 cell-derived IFNγ activates microglia to release IL-1β that reduces Cx43 gap junctions in astrocytes. Thus, Th1-dominant inflammatory states disrupt astrocytic intercellular communication and may exacerbate MS.

27779107|t|The components of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction act synergistically to exert protective effects in a rat ischemic stroke model.
27779107|a|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD, Oren-gedoku-to in Japanese) is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat ischemic stroke. This study investigated the efficacy of various combinations of the major components of HLJDD, berberine (A), baicalin (B), and jasminoidin (C), on the treatment of ischemic stroke modeled by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. The effects of A, B and C individually and their combinations were investigated using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)-based metabolomics complemented with neurologic deficit scoring, infarct volume measurement, biochemistry, histopathology and immunohistochemistry, as well as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Ischemic stroke produces severe oxidative stress, which induces further damage. Our results show that the ABC combination treatment increased levels of cellular antioxidants that scavenged reactive oxygen species during ischemia-reperfusion via the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling cascade. These protective effects were not observed with the other treatments. These results suggest that a combination of component herbs in HLJDD exhibit stronger effects than the individual herbs alone. Our integrated metabolomics approach also provides a tractable, powerful tool for understanding the science behind TCM formulations.

27591127|t|Longxuetongluo capsule inhibits atherosclerosis progression in high-fat diet-induced ApoE-/- mice by improving endothelial dysfunction.
27591127|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chinese dragon's blood has been used to treat blood stasis for thousands of years. Its total phenolic extract (Longxuetongluo capsule, LTC) is used for the treatment of ischemic stroke; however, its protective effect against atherosclerosis remains poorly understood. This paper aims to investigate the antiatherosclerotic effect of LTC and the underlying mechanisms in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced ApoE-/- mice. METHODS: The levels of plasma lipid and areas of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinus in ApoE-/- mice were evaluated. The effect of LTC on the nitric oxide (NO) production in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was determined. The adhesion of monocytes to ox-LDL-stimulated HUVECs was further studied. RESULTS: LTC at low, medium, and high doses markedly decreased the atherosclerotic lesion areas of the aortic sinus in HFD-induced ApoE-/- mice by 26.4% (p < 0.05), 30.1% (p < 0.05), and 46.5% (p < 0.01), respectively, although it did not improve the dyslipidemia. Furthermore, LTC restored the diminished NO production of ox-LDL-stimulated HUVECs (p < 0.001) and inhibited the adhesion between monocytes and endothelial cells (p < 0.01). LTC appeared to alleviate ox-LDL-stimulated dysfunction of HUVECs, and inhibit the adhesion of monocytes to HUVECs via the MAPK/IKK/IκB/NF-κB signaling pathway, thus decrease atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinus in HFD-induced ApoE-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the potential of LTC for use as an effective agent against atherosclerosis.

27647662|t|Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency predicts poor outcome amongst acute ischaemic stroke patients with low high density lipoprotein cholesterol.
27647662|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current observational studies indicate that a lower vitamin D level is associated with a higher risk of poor ischaemic stroke prognosis. Whether this association is affected by lipid levels is unclear. Our aim was to examine the effect of serum vitamin D especially its deficiency on the global outcome of ischaemic stroke stratified by individual lipid component level. METHODS: A total of 3181 ischaemic patients from China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischaemic Stroke were included in this study and their baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were tested. They were prospectively followed up for death, major disability and vascular events for 3 months after acute ischaemic stroke. A multivariable logistic model was used to evaluate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and clinical outcomes of ischaemic stroke in the 3-month period of follow-up in all patients and in different lipid-level subgroups. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency was associated with poor clinical outcomes only in ischaemic stroke patients with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) <1.04 mmol/l rather than all patients. The multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of major disability and composite adverse events were 1.98 (1.08-3.63) and 2.24 (1.22-4.12), respectively. There was a significant interaction effect between vitamin D and HDLC levels on major disability and the composite outcome (P for interaction < 0.05 for both). A significant linear trend existed between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of poor prognosis (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency may be merely an independent risk factor of poor prognosis in ischaemic stroke patients with low HDLC level.

27592180|t|Clinical Efficacy of Acupuncture Treatment in Combination With RehaCom Cognitive Training for Improving Cognitive Function in Stroke: A 2 × 2 Factorial Design Randomized Controlled Trial.
27592180|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in combination with RehaCom cognitive training in poststroke patients with cognitive dysfunction. METHODS/DESIGN: This study was a 2 × 2 factorial design randomized controlled trial comparing acupuncture, computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation, and the usual treatment by per-protocol analysis. The trial was completed by 204 stroke patients, including 49 patients in a control group, 52 patients in an acupuncture treatment group, 51 patients in a RehaCom training group, and 52 patients in an acupuncture combined with RehaCom group. All of the patients accepted basic treatment and health education. The interventions continued for 12 weeks (30 minutes per day, 5 days per week). The relative cognitive and functional outcomes were measured at baseline and 12 weeks (at the end of intervention) using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scales. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, the functional statuses of the patients in each of the 4 groups showed varying degrees of improvement. Multiple comparisons of the changes in the MMSE, MoCA, and FIM scores indicated that acupuncture combined with RehaCom cognitive training (ACR) had enhanced therapeutic effects on the functional statuses of the stroke patients (P < .05). In addition, ACR had similar therapeutic effects on the functional statuses of the stroke patients according to each of the assessment scales applied (P△change value MMSE = 0.399, P△MoCA = 0.794, P△FIM = 0.862). The interaction effect values between acupuncture and RehaCom training (acceptance or nonacceptance) were as follows: △MMSE: F = 6.251, P = .013; △MoCA: F = 4.991, P = .027; and △FIM: F = 6.317, P = .013. Further, the main effect values for acupuncture and RehaCom training were both significant (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: There is an interaction effect in the treatment of stroke patients using ACR. The use of acupuncture in combination with RehaCom training has better therapeutic effects on the functional statuses of poststroke patients than the use of either treatment alone, demonstrating the clinical significance of this combination therapy.

27734585|t|Ultrafiltration-LC-MS combined with semi-preparative HPLC for the simultaneous screening and isolation of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors from Belamcanda chinensis.
27734585|a|Stroke represents the fourth leading cause of death in the USA and the second leading cause of death worldwide. Lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of ischemic stroke and natural products are considered a promising source of novel lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors. In this study, we used PC12 cells to determine the protective effect of extracts from the herb Belamcanda chinensis following toxic challenge. Using ultrafiltration high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photo-diode array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we screened and identified isoflavonoids from Belamcanda chinensis extracts. Semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography was then applied to separate and isolate the active constituents. Using these methods, we identified six major compounds in Belamcanda chinensis as lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors: tectoridin, iristectorin A, iridin, tectorigenin, irigenin, and irisflorentin, which were then isolated to >92% purity. This is the first report that Belamcanda chinensis extracts contain potent lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that the systematic isolation of bioactive components from Belamcanda chinensis guided by ultrafiltration high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photo-diode array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry represents a feasible and efficient technique that could be extended for the identification and isolation of other enzyme inhibitors.

27779673|t|Suppressive effects of Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction on MCAO-induced NO and PGE2 production are dependent on the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.
27779673|a|The present study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects, and underlying mechanisms, of Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction (GLGZD) in a rat model of neuroinflammation. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with GLGZD following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neurological function and infarct volume were evaluated to confirm successful generation of the rat model. Subsequently, brain tissues and blood samples were collected for further analysis. Nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were evaluated in peripheral blood samples using the Griess reagent assay and an ELISA, respectively. The relative expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cylooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2) were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The associated pathways, including nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) and mitogen‑activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathways, were detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and western blotting. The results demonstrated that treatment with GLGZD significantly inhibited MCAO-induced inflammation; GLGZD suppressed the production of NO and PGE2, and the expression of iNOS and COX‑2, by inhibiting NF‑κB activation and MAPK phosphorylation. These findings suggest that GLGZD, a potential agent for post‑stroke treatment, may exert anti‑inflammatory effects, thus providing neuroprotection.

30919693|t|Synthesis and biological evaluation of n-butylphthalide derivatives as anti-platelet aggregation agents.
30919693|a|New analogues of n-butylphthalide (NBP) bearing various lengths of alkyl and different substitution at the two-position of phthalide were designed and synthesised. Preliminary evaluation and prediction of ACD LogP software indicate that the derivatives display significant improvement in water solubility than NBP does. Further biological analysis showed that NBP analogues specifically inhibit platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid but have no effect on that induced by adenosine 5-diphosphate. Especially compounds 1 and 3 were stronger than classical anti-platelet drug, aspirin, and equal potent with NBP, respectively. These findings provide an alternative approach to the development of NBP analogues with anti-platelet aggregation activity with good water solubility for the intervention of ischemic stroke.

28197190|t|Electroacupuncture induces acute changes in cerebral cortical miRNA profile, improves cerebral blood flow and alleviates neurological deficits in a rat model of stroke.
28197190|a|Electroacupuncture has been shown to improve cerebral blood flow in animal models of stroke. However, it is unclear whether electroacupuncture alters miRNA expression in the cortex. In this study, we examined changes in the cerebral cortical miRNA profile, cerebral blood flow and neurological function induced by electroacupuncture in a rat model of stroke. Electroacupuncture was performed at Renzhong (GV26) and Neiguan (PC6), with a frequency of 2 Hz, continuous wave, current intensity of 3.0 mA, and stimulation time of 1 minute. Electroacupuncture increased cerebral blood flow and alleviated neurological impairment in the rats. miRNA microarray profiling revealed that the vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway, which links cell proliferation with stroke, was most significantly affected by electroacupuncture. Electroacupuncture induced changes in expression of rno-miR-206-3p, rno-miR-3473, rno-miR-6216 and rno-miR-494-3p, and these changes were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our findings suggest that changes in cell proliferation-associated miRNA expression induced by electroacupuncture might be associated with the improved cerebral blood supply and functional recovery following stroke.

26899592|t|Effects of Oriental Medicine Kyung-Ok-Ko on Uterine Abnormality in Hyperandrogenized Rats.
26899592|a|A traditional herbal prescription Kyung-Ok-Ko (KOK), composed of Rehmannia glutinosa Liboschitz var. purpurae, Lycium chinense, Aquilaria agallocha, Poria cocos, Panax ginseng, and honey, has been widely used in Oriental medicine as an invigorant for age-related diseases, such as amnesia and stroke. However, the beneficial value of KOK on uterine dysfunction related to hyperandrogenism is largely unknown. We investigated the effect of KOK (2.0 g/kg/day, per os) on endometrial abnormalities in a dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA, subcutaneous)-induced polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) rat model. Preadministration of KOK significantly (p<0.05) decreased the elevated body weight, uterus weight, and endometrial thickness by PCOS induction, corresponding to reduced apoptosis and the infiltration of immune cells (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages) in the endometrium. These results were associated with reduced mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinase-3 and increased mRNA expression of IGF-β1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, TGF-β1, and vascular endothelial growth factor in the uterus after DHEA injection. These multiple effects of KOK may synergistically prevent the development of endometrial abnormalities in DHEA-induced hyperandrogenism via anti-inflammatory action, indicating that KOK has preventive and therapeutic potential for suppressing PCOS.

28933125|t|[Analysis of Diemailing Kudiezi injection use in real world in 7 189 patients with cerebral infarction].
28933125|a|This is a study based on hospital intensive monitoring to explore medication use of Diemailing Kudiezi injection(one Chinese herbal medicine injection) in real word in the patients with cerebral infarction. The active monitoring model was adopted and hospital intensive monitoring on safety of 7 189 cases of patients with cerebral infarction was conducted to obtain the drug use information of Diemailing injection. The results were analyzed by using statistical description and association rule method. The statistical description and association rule analysis were conducted based on patients' basic demographic characteristics, use of Diemailing injection and combined use of drugs. Sixty-two percent(4 437/7 189) of the patients were from traditional Chinese medicine hospitals as compared with 39%(2 752/7 189) from western medicine hospitals; 84%(6 003/7 189) of the patients were from tertiary hospitals as compared with 16%(1 186/7 189) from second-class hospitals. The hospitals were mostly located in north China. Drug related indicators such as a single dripping speed, stash time after allocating transfusion, duration of injection, and injecting room temperature were not noted in instruction manual. It was also found that there were off label use in the practice, for instance, non-intravenous infusion, >14 d treatment course, use of non-designated solvent, and a single dose>40 mL or<10 mL. Analysis of association rules showed that only Edaravone among the most frequent combined drugs was listed in the current guideline in China, and the other three most frequent combined drugs deproteinized calf blood extractive injection, Cinepazide Maleate injection and Alprostadil injection were used with little evidence. Diemailing＋Aspirin＋Alprostadil was the most common combined use in our study, but the recommended clopidogrel＋Aspirin was not found in this study. The drug use situation of Diemailing injection in the real world was obtained by data analysis on large size samples, providing basic reference information for clinicians and researchers. However, efficacy was not concerned in this study, so efficacy-related information could not be explained.

27632784|t|The pharmacokinetic screening of multiple components of the Nao Mai Tong formula in rat plasma by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry combined with pattern recognition method and its application to comparative pharmacokinetics.
27632784|a|The Nao Mai Tong formula (NMT) is composed of Rhubarb, Ginseng, Ligusticum wallichii and Pueraria in a ratio of 3:3:2:2 (w/w) and is a well-known traditional Chinese prescription that has been clinically employed for treating ischemia cerebrovascular disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of multiple components (chryohol-8-O-β-D-glucoyroide, physcion-8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rb3, ginsenoside Rc, senkyunolide I, ligustilide puerarin, daidzein, 3'-methoxy puerarin) after the oral administration of the NMT formula in rats. A rapid and sensitive UHPLC-Quadrupole-Orbitrap-MS with a sequential positive and negative ionization mode was developed to determine the 15 absorbed ingredients. After extraction from blood, the analytes and internal standards were subjected to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with Agela Venusil MPC18 (2.1mm×100mm, 3μm, Agela, USA). The mobile phase consisted of methanol and ammonium acetate (3mmolL-1) under gradient elution conditions. This validated method was successfully applied to a comparative pharmacokinetic study of fifteen components in rat plasma after oral administration of the NMT formula or single herb extracts to normal and stroke-afflicted rats. A principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to evaluate the differences in the pharmacokinetic behavior (time-course) of the absorbed components of NMT, and the absorbed components were assigned to 3 separate clusters. A comparison of the body dynamics of each group indicated that cluster B (ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rb3, ginsenoside Rc) might be the most important constituents controlling the pharmacological effects of NMT. The comparative pharmacokinetic study showed that the different groups had different pharmacokinetic characteristics. The pharmacokinetics-based UHPLC Quadrupole-Orbitrap-MS using a full-scan mode combined with a pattern recognition approach can provide a reliable and suitable means of screening and identifying potentially bioactive components that contribute to the pharmacological effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

27612048|t|Robust low-dose dynamic cerebral perfusion CT image restoration via coupled dictionary learning scheme.
27612048|a|Dynamic cerebral perfusion x-ray computed tomography (PCT) imaging has been advocated to quantitatively and qualitatively assess hemodynamic parameters in the diagnosis of acute stroke or chronic cerebrovascular diseases. However, the associated radiation dose is a significant concern to patients due to its dynamic scan protocol. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an image restoration method by utilizing coupled dictionary learning (CDL) scheme to yield clinically acceptable PCT images with low-dose data acquisition. Specifically, in the present CDL scheme, the 2D background information from the average of the baseline time frames of low-dose unenhanced CT images and the 3D enhancement information from normal-dose sequential cerebral PCT images are exploited to train the dictionary atoms respectively. After getting the two trained dictionaries, we couple them to represent the desired PCT images as spatio-temporal prior in objective function construction. Finally, the low-dose dynamic cerebral PCT images are restored by using a general DL image processing. To get a robust solution, the objective function is solved by using a modified dictionary learning based image restoration algorithm. The experimental results on clinical data show that the present method can yield more accurate kinetic enhanced details and diagnostic hemodynamic parameter maps than the state-of-the-art methods.

27864581|t|Prognostic Value of Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) in Patients with Hyperacute Cerebral Infarction Receiving rt-PA Intravenous Thrombolytic Therapy.
27864581|a|BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the potential value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the prognosis of patients with hyperacute cerebral infarction (HCI) receiving intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). MATERIAL AND METHODS From June 2012 to June 2015, 58 cases of HCI (<6 h) undergoing rt-PA intravenous thrombolytic therapy (thrombolysis group) and 70 cases of HCI (<6 h) undergoing conventional antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy (control group) in the same period were collected. DWI was conducted on all the subjects, and ADC maps were generated with Functool software to quantify ADC value. The clinical outcomes of HCI patients were observed for 3 months, and prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS Before thrombolysis treatment, the lesion area presented high signal intensity on DWI map and low signal intensity on ADC map, and gradually weakened signal intensity on DWI map and gradually enhanced signal intensity on ADC map were observed after thrombolysis. The ADC values of the thrombolysis group were significantly higher than those of the control group after treatment (24 h, 7 d, 30 d, and 90 d) (all P<0.05), and the ADC and rADC values in the thrombolysis group gradually increased over time (all P<0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, baseline rADC value, and stroke history were the independent factors for the prognosis of HIC patients with thrombolysis (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The values of ADC and rADC may provide guidance in the prognosis of HCI patients receiving rt-PA, and the baseline rADC value is the protective factor for the prognosis of HCI patients receiving rt-PA.

27852282|t|Effect of acupuncture on insomnia following stroke: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
27852282|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence, mortality, and prevalence of stroke are high in China. Stroke is commonly associated with insomnia; both insomnia and stroke have been effectively treated with acupuncture for a long time. The aim of this proposed trial is to assess the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on insomnia following stroke. METHODS: This proposed study is a single-center, single-blinded (patient-assessor-blinded), parallel-group randomized controlled trial. We will randomly assign 60 participants with insomnia following stroke into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group will undergo traditional acupuncture that achieves the De-qi sensation, and the control group will receive sham acupuncture without needle insertion. The same acupoints (DU20, DU24, EX-HN3, EX-HN22, HT7, and SP6) will be used in both groups. Treatments will be given to all participants three times a week for the subsequent 4 weeks. The primary outcome will be the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The secondary outcomes will be: the Insomnia Severity Index; sleep efficacy, sleep awakenings, and total sleep time recorded via actigraphy; the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life score; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The use of estazolam will be permitted and regulated under certain conditions. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks after treatment commencement, 4 weeks after treatment commencement, and at the 8-week follow-up. DISCUSSION: This proposed study will contribute to expanding knowledge about acupuncture treatment for insomnia following stroke. This will be a high-quality randomized controlled trial with strict methodology and few design deficits. It will investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture as an alternative treatment for insomnia following stroke. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry identifier: ChiCTR-IIC-16008382 .

27772792|t|The homocysteine associated variant rs548987 of SLC17A3 confers susceptibility to ischemic stroke in Chinese population.
27772792|a|Ischemic stroke is a common cause of death due to obstructed blood supply of the brain. Despite growing numbers of research, etiology underlying ischemic stroke remains complex and elusive. Elevated plasma homocysteine has been known as a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Recently, a genome-wide association study reported association between rs548987 of SLC17A3 and homocysteine. Given existing relation between homocysteine and ischemic stroke, SLC17A3 was believed to be a promising candidate gene of ischemic stroke. Indeed, its association with ischemic stroke was previously reported in a western population. Herein, we used rs548987 as a candidate genetic variant of ischemic stroke and performed association analysis in a Chinese population with 918 ischemic stroke cases and 979 controls. Although rs548987 failed to show significant association with total ischemic stroke and large vessel disease subtype, the C allele of rs548987 showed significant association with small vessel disease subtype of ischemic stroke (OR=0.68, p=0.004). Our preliminary results suggested different genetic etiology underlying the two most common subtypes of ischemic stroke and provided additional evidence to understand contribution of homocysteine to the disease.

27814708|t|Neuroprotective effect of a novel Chinese herbal decoction on cultured neurons and cerebral ischemic rats.
27814708|a|BACKGROUND: Historically, traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used to treat stroke. Based on the theory of Chinese medicine and the modern pharmacological knowledge of herbal medicines, we have designed a neuroprotective formula called Post-Stroke Rehabilitation (PSR), comprising seven herbs - Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Cassia obtusifolia L., Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort., Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. We aim to examine the neuroprotective activity of PSR in vitro and in vivo, and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, to better understand its therapeutic effect and to further optimize its efficacy. METHODS: PSR extract or vehicle was applied to primary rat neurons to examine their survival effects against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-elicited excitotoxicity. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was conducted to examine the NMDA-induced current in the presence of PSR. ERK- and CREB-activation were revealed by western blot analysis. Furthermore, PSR was tested for CRE promoter activation in neurons transfected with a luciferase reporter. The protective effect of PSR was then studied in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. MCAO rats were either treated with PSR extract or vehicle, and their neurobehavioral deficit and cerebral infarct were evaluated. Statistical differences were analyzed by ANOVA or t-test. RESULTS: PSR prominently reduced the death of cultured neurons caused by NMDA excitotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating its neuroprotective property. Furthermore, PSR significantly reduced NMDA-evoked current reversibly and activated phosphorylation of ERK and CREB with distinct time courses, with the latter's kinetics slower. PSR also triggered CRE-promoter activity as revealed by the increased expression of luciferase reporter in transfected neurons. PSR effectively reduced cerebral infarct and deficit in neurological behavior in MCAO rats when PSR decoction was administered starting either 6 days before or 6 h after onset of ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: PSR is neuroprotective both in vitro and in vivo - it protects cultured neurons against NMDA excitotoxicity, and effectively reduces ischemic injury and neurobehavioral deficit in MCAO rats in both the pre- and post-treatment regimens. The underlying neuroprotective mechanisms may involve inhibition of NMDA receptor current and activation of ERK and CREB. This study provides important preclinical data necessary for the further development of PSR for stroke treatment.

27586823|t|Xinmailong mitigated epirubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via inhibiting autophagy.
27586823|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Using insects, such as the cockroach, for the treatment of disease has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine. Xinmailong (XML) Injection, a bioactive composite extracted from Periplaneta americana (a species of cockroach), shows reasonable protective effects against cardiovascular injury and was approved for the use in the treatment of cardiac dysfunction in 2006, yet its cardio protective mechanisms remain unclear. AIM: The present study aims to examine the protective effects of XML against epirubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and determine its underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical characteristics of XML were identified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Rats were intraperitoneally injected with epirubicin and then treated with XML for 14 days. Survival rate, echocardiography, electrocardiographic recordings and Masson staining were used to evaluate the cardioprotective activity of XML. Western blot and quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of XML. RESULTS: XML treatment significantly enhanced the survival rate of rats from epirubicin-induced heart failure. XML prevented left ventricle dilatation, improved cardiac function. Furthermore, treatment with XML also significantly inhibited the accumulation of collagen, reduced the levels of mRNA for matrix metalloproteinases-9 (Mmp9) and transforming growth factor-β 1(Tgfb1). This action of XML therefore might be responsible, at least in part, for the attenuation of cardiac fibrotic remodeling. XML inhibited autophagy as evidenced by the decreased accumulation of Beclin1 and autophagy related 7 (Atg7), which are necessary to form autophagosome structures. Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and B cell lymphoma2 (Bcl2) levels were up-regulated, while significantly decreased protein levels for phosphorylated P38 and extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) were observed in the XML treated rats. The autophagy related results suggested that the increase in PI3K/Akt levels and inhibition of the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK and Erk1/2 contributed to the anti-autophagic activity of XML. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that XML may be effective for mitigating epirubicin-induced cardiomyopathy and inhibits autophagy via activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting the Erk1/2 and P38 MAPK signaling pathways.

27459888|t|Mechanistic understanding of the effect of Dengzhan Shengmai capsule on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel in rats.
27459888|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Dengzhan Shengmai capsule (DZSM) is known in China for its remarkable curative effect as a treatment of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. DZSM is a Chinese herbal compound preparation that consists of four ingredients, including Erigeron breviscapus (Vaniot) Hand.-Mazz., Panax ginseng C.A. Mey, Ophiopogon japonicas (Thunb.) Ker-Gawl. and Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill., and was indexed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2010. DZSM and clopidogrel are often co-prescribed in the clinic to prevent the recurrence of stroke or other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, the effect of DZSM on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of the study is to explore the pharmacokinetics and potential interaction between DZSM and clopidogrel and the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were used to investigate the effect of DZSM on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and its active metabolite in vivo. The plasma concentrations were simultaneously determined using LC-MS/MS. The effects of DZSM on the P-gp-mediated efflux transport and CYP450-mediated metabolism of clopidogrel were investigated using MDCKII-MDR1 cells and rat liver microsomes, respectively. RESULTS: After pretreatment with DZSM, the Cmax and AUC0-∞ of clopidogrel increased from 0.4±0.1 to 1.7±0.6ng/mL and 0.9±0.4 to 2.0±0.2ng/mLh, respectively. The Cmax and AUC0-∞ of the derivatized active metabolite of clopidogrel decreased from 8.2±1.2 to 2.8±0.5ng/mL and 18.2±5.6 to 6.4±3.7ngh/mL, respectively. In MDCKII-MDR1 cells, the P-gp-mediated efflux transport of clopidogrel was significantly inhibited by the DZSM extract. In rat liver microsomes, DZSM inhibited clopidogrel metabolism with an IC50 of 0.02mg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: DZSM significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and its active metabolite by inhibiting the P-gp-mediated efflux transport and CYP450-mediated metabolism of clopidogrel. Thus, caution is needed when DZSM is co-administered with clopidogrel in the clinic because the interaction of these drugs may result in altered plasma concentrations of clopidogrel and its active metabolite.

27396346|t|Neuroprotective effect and mechanism of Mu-Xiang-You-Fang on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.
27396346|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The present study is to investigate the neuroprotective effect of Mu-Xiang-You-Fang (MXYF), a classic Traditional Chinese Medicine used by Chinese minorities to treat stroke, on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and the related signaling pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups: sham group, I/R group, nimodipine and MXYF (58, 116 and 232mg/kg respectively) groups. Cerebral ischemia model was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2h followed by reperfusion for 48h. Neurological functional score was evaluated according to the method of Zea longa's score and the infarct area was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 48h after reperfusion. The protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt-c), Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3 and caspase-7 were analyzed by western blot and the mRNA expression of Caspase-9, Caspase-3 and Caspase-7 were determined by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Oral administration of MXYF (116 and 232mg/kg) significantly reduced the neurological functional score and attenuated the cerebral infarct area. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of Bcl-2 is enhanced and Bax expression is inhibited after treatment with MXYF (116 and 232mg/kg), leading to significant increase of the ratio between Bcl-2 and Bax. Furthermore, the protein expression of cyt-c, caspase-9, caspase-3 and caspase-7 was significantly inhibited while the mRNA expression of caspase-9, caspase-3 and caspase-7 but not cyt-c was markedly inhibited in the MXYF (116 and 232mg/kg) treatment groups compared with the I/R group. CONCLUSIONS: The above data suggested that MXYF has potential neuroprotective activities by the regulation of apoptotic pathway, MXYF is a promising agent in treatment of stroke.

27812119|t|Daesiho-Tang Is an Effective Herbal Formulation in Attenuation of Obesity in Mice through Alteration of Gene Expression and Modulation of Intestinal Microbiota.
27812119|a|BACKGROUND: Obesity has become a major global health challenge due to its increasing prevalence, and the associated health risk. It is the main cause of various metabolic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke and certain forms of cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study we evaluated the anti-obesity property of Daesiho-tang (DSHT), an herbal medicine, using high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice as a model. Our results showed that DSHT ameliorated body weight gain, decreased total body fat, regulated expression of leptin and adiponectin genes of adipose tissue and exerted an anti-diabetic effect by attenuating fasting glucose level and serum insulin level in HFD-fed animals. In addition, DSHT-treatment significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and increased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) levels in serum and reduced deposition of fat droplets in liver. DSHT treatment resulted in significantly increased relative abundance of bacteria including Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, Akkermansia Bifidobacterium., Lactobacillus, and decreased the level of Firmicutes. Using RT2 profiler PCR array, 39 (46%) genes were found to be differentially expressed in HFD-fed mice compared to normal control. However, normal gene expressions were restored in 36 (92%) genes of HFD-fed mice, when co-exposed to DSHT. CONCLUSION/MAJOR FINDINGS: The results of this study demonstrated that DSHT is an effective herbal formulation in attenuation of obesity in HFD-fed mice through alteration of gene expressions and modulation of intestinal microbiota.

27818918|t|The fate of medications evaluated for ischemic stroke pharmacotherapy over the period 1995-2015.
27818918|a|Stroke is a brain damage caused by a loss of blood supply to a portion of the brain, which requires prompt and effective treatment. The current pharmacotherapy for ischemic stroke primarily relies on thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (rt-PAs) to breakdown blood clots. Neuroprotective agents that inhibit excitatory neurotransmitters are also used to treat ischemic stroke but have failed to translate into clinical benefits. This poses a major challenge in biomedical research to understand what causes the progressive brain cell death after stroke and how to develop an effective pharmacotherapy for stroke. This brief review analyzes the fate of about 430 potentially useful stroke medications over the period 1995-2015 and describes in detail those that successfully reached the market. Hopefully, the information from this analysis will shed light on how future stroke research can improve stroke drug discovery.

27637156|t|Enriched environment improves post-stroke cognitive impairment in mice by potential regulation of acetylation homeostasis in cholinergic circuits.
27637156|a|Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI), commonly seen in the clinical practice, is a major factor impeding patient rehabilitation. Enriched environment (EE) intervention is a simple and effective way to improve cognitive impairment, partially due to the rebalancing of the basal forebrain-hippocampus cholinergic signaling pathway. Epigenetic changes have been identified in many cognitive disorders. However, studies on the effects of EE on epigenetic regulation of cholinergic circuits in PSCI animal models have not yet been reported. In this study, we established a photothrombotic mouse PSCI model and showed that after EE intervention, mice with PSCI had significantly improved water maze performance, better induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), enhanced function of the basal forebrain-hippocampus cholinergic circuits of contralateral side of stroke and relatively balanced acetylation homeostasis compared to those of PSCI mice in standard environments (SE). In addition, PSCI mice in EE expressed much higher levels of p-CREB and CBP than in SE, and the chromatins bound to M-type promoter of ChAT gene were more acetylated. These results demonstrate that EE plays an important role in the improvement of PSCI and the underlying mechanism may involve in the acetylation of histones bound to the ChAT gene promoter in cholinergic circuits.

27554073|t|Aerobic Exercises for Cognition Rehabilitation following Stroke: A Systematic Review.
27554073|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairments are highly prevalent in stroke survivors and can substantially affect their physical rehabilitation and quality of life. The management of these impairments currently remains limited, but increasing studies reported the effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance in patients suffering from stroke. The purpose of this review was to assess the effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive function following stroke. METHODS: Seven electronic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database [VIP], Wanfang, China Biology Medicine disc [CBM], Science Citation Index [SCI], EMBASE, and PubMed) were searched from their inception to May 31, 2015, for the effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive ability compared to usual physical activity in stroke survivors. RevMan V5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre) was used to analyze the data and to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Ten eligible studies including 394 participants were identified. Six studies showed that aerobic exercise significantly improved global cognitive ability in stroke survivors. Four studies reported aerobic exercise to be beneficial in improving memory, but only one showed statistical significance. Two studies investigated the effects of aerobic exercise on attention, and one showed a significant improvement. One study reported a significant benefit of aerobic exercise on visuospatial ability in stroke survivors. No adverse events were reported in the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise may have a positive effect on improving global cognitive ability and a potential benefit on memory, attention, and the visuospatial domain of cognition in stroke survivors. However, further large, rigorously designed trials are needed to confirm these findings.

26614511|t|Tetramethylpyrazine Promotes Migration of Neural Precursor Cells via Activating the Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Pathway.
26614511|a|Stem cell therapy may provide a novel therapeutic method for the replacement and regeneration of damaged neural cells in the central nervous system. However, insufficient stem cell migrating into the injured regions limits its applications. Although tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) originally isolated from Ligusticum walliichi (Chuanxiong) has been widely used to treat ischemic stroke in the clinic for many years because of its role in neuroprotection, how TMP impacts the migration of neural progenitor/precursor cells (NPCs) and what is the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism remain largely unknown. Here, we found that TMP promoted NPC migration through increasing the expression and secretion of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), a chemokine that has been well demonstrated to direct NPC cell trafficking, in a dose-dependent fashion as analyzed by using different methods. The role of TMP in NPC migration could be inhibited by AMD 3100, a chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) antagonist. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms revealed that TMP treatment rapidly activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, protein kinase C (PKC), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not Pyk2, in NPCs. NPC migration could be blocked by using pharmacological inhibitors for these signaling pathways such as LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor), Myr-ψPKC (a PKC inhibitor), and an ERK1/2 inhibitor. Furthermore, TMP enhanced NPC migration toward the ischemic region in the MCAO rat model. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of TMP in treating the neuropathological diseases, which suggest that TMP may be used as a potent drug for improving NPC migration in stem cell-based therapy.

26526842|t|Evaluation of Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Helminthostachys zeylanica Extracts via Inhibiting Bradykinin-Induced MMP-9 Expression in Brain Astrocytes.
26526842|a|Phytochemicals present in vegetables, fruits, and herbs are believed to reduce the risk of several major diseases including cardiovascular or neurodegenerative disorders. The roots of the fern Helminthostachys zeylanica (L.) Hook. (Ophioglossaceae) have been used for centuries in the treatment of inflammation and as a folk medicine in several countries. The plant has been shown to possess an array of medicinal properties, including antioxidants and anti-inflammatory activities. Moreover, a rising level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has been found in blood fluid of these patients suffering from brain inflammatory diseases, which may be considered an inflammatory biomarker in several inflammatory diseases including the central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Previously, we have demonstrated the signaling mechanisms of bradykinin (BK)-induced MMP-9 expression in brain astrocytes. Herein, we evaluate the effects of H. zeylanica extracts on BK-induced MMP-9 expression in brain astrocytes and its influencing mechanism. The results showed that H. zeylanica extracts, including E0, E1, and E2 significantly reduce MMP-9 induced by BK in brain astrocytes (RBA-1 cells). These H. zeylanica extracts can inhibit BK-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Src, Pyk2, and PKC(α/δ). Moreover, BK-stimulated NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation has also been attenuated by pretreatment with these extracts, suggesting that the H. zeylanica extracts have an antioxidative activity. We further demonstrated that the H. zeylanica extracts blocked activation of MAPKs (e.g., ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK) by BK. These data indicated that the H. zeylanica extracts may be has anti-inflammatory activity by reducing BK-induced ROS-dependent MMP-9 expression via these related pathways in brain astrocytes.

27732148|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid Metabolomics After Natural Product Treatment in an Experimental Model of Cerebral Ischemia.
27732148|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is an important biofluid for diagnosis of and research on neurological diseases. However, in-depth metabolomic profiling of CSF remains an analytical challenge due to the small volume of samples, particularly in small animal models. In this work, we report the application of a high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) workflow for CSF metabolomics in Gastrodia elata and Uncaria rhynchophylla water extract (GUW)-treated experimental cerebral ischemia model of rat. The GUW is a commonly used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for hypertension and brain disease. This study investigated the amine- and phenol-containing biomarkers in the CSF metabolome. After GUW treatment for 7 days, the neurological deficit score was significantly improved with infarct volume reduction, while the integrity of brain histological structure was preserved. Over 1957 metabolites were quantified in CSF by dansylation LC-MS. The analysis of this comprehensive list of metabolites suggests that metabolites associated with oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and excitotoxicity change during GUW-induced alleviation of ischemic injury. This work is significant in that (1) it shows CIL LC-MS can be used for in-depth profiling of the CSF metabolome in experimental ischemic stroke and (2) identifies several potential molecular targets (that might mediate the central nervous system) and associate with pharmacodynamic effects of some frequently used TCMs.

29071942|t|[Effect of Scalp-acupuncture Stimulation on Neurological Function and Expression of ASIC 1 a and ASIC 2 b of Hippocampal CA 1 Region in Cerebral Ischemia Rats].
29071942|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of scalp-acupuncture on the expression of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) 1 a and 2 b of hippocampal CA 1 region in cerebral ischemia (CI) rats, so as to investigate its mechanism underlying improvement of ischemic stroke. METHODS: Thirty-two male SD rats were randomly allocated to normal control, model, scalp-acupuncture and Amiloride group (n=8 in each group). The model of focal CI was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Scalp acupuncture stimulation was applied to bilateral Dingnieqianxiexian (MS 6) and Dingniehouxiexian (MS 7), once daily for 7 days. Rats of the Amiloride group were fed with Amiloride solution, twice a day for 7 days, and those of the normal control and model groups were grabbled and fixed in the same way with the acupuncture and Amiloride groups. The neurological deficit score was given according to Longa's method. The expression of hippocampal ASIC 1 a and ASIC 2 b was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the Ca2+ concentration in the hippocampal tissue assayed using flowing cytometry. RESULTS: After the intervention, the neurological deficit score of both the scalp-acupuncture and Amiloride groups were significantly decreased in comparison with pre-treatment (P<0.01), and the effect of scalp-acupuncture was markedly superior to that of Amiloride in reducing neurological deficit score (P<0.05). The expression of ASIC 1 a and ASIC 2 b in the hippocampal CA 1 region and hip-pocampal Ca2+ concentration were significantly up-regulated in the model group compared with the normal control group (P<0.01), and obviously down-regulated in both scalp-acupuncture and Amiloride groups (P<0.01, P<0.05),without significant differences between the two treatment groups in the ASIC 1 a and ASIC 2 b expression and Ca2+ concentration (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Scalp-acupuncture stimulation can improve neurological function in CI rats, which may be related to its effects in suppressing the increased expression of hippocampal ASIC 1 a and ASIC 2 b proteins and in reducing calcium overload in hip-pocampal neurocytes.

27524398|t|Senkyunolide I attenuates oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced inflammation in microglial cells.
27524398|a|Over-activated microglia during stroke has been documented to aggravate brain damage. Our previous studies showed that senkyunolide I (SEI) exerted anti-inflammatory effects against endotoxin insult in vitro and ameliorative effects on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in vivo. Using oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic stroke, we here investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of SEI on microglial cells and explored the underlying mechanisms. OGD for 3h followed by reoxygenation for 12h significantly enhanced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and expressions of inflammation-related enzymes in BV-2 cells, which was inhibited by pretreatment with SEI. To elucidate the mechanisms, we studied its effect on upstream signaling pathways. It was found that SEI suppressed the activation of NF-κB pathway induced by OGD/R and the MAPK pathway was shown not to be involved. Furthermore, SEI significantly down-regulated TLR4/MyD88 pathway with specifically improving inducible Hsp70 level through increasing HSF-1/DNA binding activity, and these regulations responsive to SEI were attenuated by transfecting Hsp70 siRNA and HSF-1 decoy ODNs. Additionally, SEI exerted similar influence on Hsp70/TLR4/NF-κB pathway in rat primary microglial cells. The results suggested that SEI had a potent effect against stroke-induced neuroinflammation through suppressing the TLR4/NF-κB pathway by up-regulating Hsp70 dependent on HSF-1.

29231519|t|[Clinical study for stroke treated with meridian-collateral diagnosis and therapy by WANG Juyi].
29231519|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect difference for stroke between meridian-collateral diagnosis and therapy by WANG Juyiand conventional acupuncture with syndrome differentiation. METHODS: Totally 148 patients were assigned into an observation group(72 cases) and a control group(76 cases) by random number table,with 10 cases dropping out in the observation group. In the observation group,meridians were examined and differentiated and then the treating meridians and acupoints were defined. Corresponding acupuncture was used according to them. In the control group,acupuncture was applied at acupoints by internal differentiation and experience. Treatment was given once a day and five times a week,with total 20 times. The motion function of limbs and coloboma degree of nerve function were assessed by Fugl-Meyer score and National Institutes of Health Stroke Score(NIHSS) before and after treatment as well as at three-month follow-up. RESULTS: After treatment,the Fugl-Meyer scores increased and the NIHSS scores decreased in the two groups compared with those before treatment(all P<0.05). At follow-up three months after treatment,Fugl-Meyer score upgraded in the observation group (P<0.05) and NIHSS score declined in the two groups (both P<0.01) than those before treatment,and NIHSS scores were statistically different between the two groups(P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Meridian-collateral diagnosis and therapy by WANG Juyi has better long-term efficacy when it is compared with conventional acupuncture with syndrome differentiation for motion function of limbs and nerve function of stroke.

27095698|t|Acupuncture for a first episode of acute ischaemic stroke: an observer-blinded randomised controlled pilot study.
27095698|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the required sample size for, and feasibility of, a RCT examining the effectiveness of early acupuncture for acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients aged 40-85 years with a first episode of acute ischaemic stroke presenting within 72 h of stroke onset were randomly assigned to receive manual acupuncture (MA group; n=20) plus standard care or standard care only (control group, n=18). The acupuncture treatment was provided daily for 2 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score between baseline and 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) and the functional independence measure scores between baseline and 4 weeks, and changes in NIHSS, Barthel Index and modified Rankin Scale scores at 12 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients completed the study (dropout rate=18%) and adverse effects were minimal. No significant differences were seen between groups in the improvements in NIHSS scores, although there tended to be a greater reduction in NIHSS score after 1 week in the MA group relative to the control group (p=0.066). The post-stroke motor activity at 4 weeks was associated with a significantly increased FMA score in the acupuncture group compared with the control group (p<0.05), but not supported by intergroup analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study indicates that acupuncture appears to be safe for patients in the acute stage of ischaemic stroke. A subsequent trial with a larger sample size (estimated at n=122) is required to confirm whether early acupuncture intervention contributes to earlier functional improvement and to assess the longer-term clinical efficacy of acupuncture.

27453543|t|Electroacupuncture modulates stromal cell-derived factor-1α expression and mobilization of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells in focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model rats.
27453543|a|Stromal cell-derived factor-1α(SDF-1α) plays a crucial role in regulating the mobilization, migration and homing of endothelial progenitor cells(EPCs). Electroacupuncture(EA), a modern version of Traditional Chinese Medicine, can improve neurological recovery and angiogenesis in cerebral ischemic area. This study aimed to investigate the effects of electroacupuncture(EA) on the mobilization and migration of bone marrow EPCs and neurological functional recovery in rats model after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and the potentially involved mechanisms. Sprague-Dawley rats received filament occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 2h followed by reperfusion for 12h, 1d, 2d, 3d, 7d respectively. Rats were randomly divided into sham group, model group and EA group. After 2h of the reperfusion, EA was given at the "Baihui" (GV 20)/Siguan ("Hegu" (LI 4)/"Taichong" (LR 3)) acupoints in the EA group. Modified neurological severity score (mNSS) was used to assess the neurological functional recovery. EPCs number and SDF-1α level in bone marrow(BM) and peripheral blood(PB) were detected by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) respectively. An mNSS test showed that EA treatment significantly improved the neurological functional outcome. EPCs number in PB and BM were obviously increased in the EA group. After cerebral ischemia, the SDF-1α level was decreased in BM while it was increased in PB, which implied a gradient of SDF-1α among BM and PB after ischemia. It suggested that the forming of SDF-1α concentration gradient can induce the mobilization and homing of EPCs. Eletroacupuncture as a treatment can accelerate and increase the forming of SDF-1α concentration gradient to further induce the mobilization of EPCs and angiogenesis in ischemic brain and improve the neurological function recovery.

27461862|t|Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D predicts early recurrent stroke in ischemic stroke patients.
27461862|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: This study was conducted to determine 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] levels in serum, and to investigate their associations with stroke recurrence events in a 3-month follow-up study in Chinese patients with first-ever ischemic stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: From February 2014 to September 2015, consecutive first-ever ischemic stroke patients admitted to the Department of Emergency of our hospital were identified. Serum 25(OH) D levels were measured at admission. We followed the participants for a median of 3 months (range, 2.5-3.5 months) using a standard questionnaire. We used logistic regression models to assess the relationship between 25(OH) levels and risk of recurrent stroke. In this study, 349 ischemic stroke patients were included and completed follow-up. Thirty-seven patients (10.6%) had a stroke recurrence. Serum 25(OH) D levels in patients with recurrent stroke were significantly lower as compared with those in patients without recurrent stroke [9.9 (IQR, 7.9-14.8) ng/mL vs. 17.9 (IQR, 13.4-23.4) ng/mL; P < 0.001). After adjusting for traditional risk factors, serum 25(OH) D levels were negatively associated with the stroke recurrence (OR, 0.897; 95% CI, 0.848-0.950; P < 0.001). Compared with the first quartile of serum 25(OH) D levels, the second quartile OR for recurrent stroke was 0.466 (95% CI, 0.308-707; P = 0.006). For the third and fourth quartiles, it was 0.248 (95% CI, 0.100-0.618; P = 0.001) and 0.173 (95% CI, 0.062-0.482; P < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that reduced serum levels of 25(OH) D can predict the risk of early stroke recurrence in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke.

27044682|t|A pharmacogenomic profile of human neural progenitors undergoing differentiation in the presence of the traditional Chinese medicine NeuroAiD.
27044682|a|NeuroAiD, a traditional Chinese medicine widely used to treat stroke patients in China, was recently demonstrated in rodent models and in clinical trials to possess neuroregenerative and neuroprotective properties. In order to understand the mechanisms employed by NeuroAiD to bring about its neuroproliferative and neuroprotective effects, we investigated the impact of MLC901, a reformulated version of MLC601, on human neural progenitors undergoing neural differentiation at the molecular level by performing three independent microarray experiments. Functional annotations of the genes regulated by MLC901 that were associated with neurogenesis were found to be enriched. We also identified potential targets (FGF19, GALR2, MMP10, FGF3 and TDO2) of MLC901 that could promote neurogenesis and neuroprotection in the human brain. This work highlighted some interesting targets and offered some insights into the possible mechanism of action of MLC901. The discovery could also provide a platform to the development of future therapeutic targets.

28925168|t|[Meta-analysis of supplemented Zhenwu decoction for treating congestive heart-failure].
28925168|a|The paper was to systematically evaluate the clinical efficacy of supplemented Zhenwu decoction for treating congestive heart-failure. Three foreign language databases including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMbase and four Chinese databases including CBM, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang Database were retrieved from their establishment to July 2016 for all randomized control trials(RCTs) on supplemented Zhenwu decoction in treatment of congestive heart-failure. The references in the included RCTs were also traced. Literature selection and information extraction was completed and screened by two independent reviewers, and Meta-analysis was performed by using RevMan 5.3 software. Totally 13 clinical RCTs were included in this study, involving 982 patients. Meta-analysis results showed that as compared with western medicine alone, the total effective rate of heart function could be improved by applying supplemented Zhenwu decoction based on the western medicine[RR=1.16, 95%CI (1.10, 1.22)], with increased ejection fraction[MD=7.12, 95%CI= (3.98,10.27)], increased cardiac activity index[MD=6.92, 95%CI (5.21, 8.62)], increased stroke volume [MD=11.18, 95%CI (6.04, 16.33)], and increased heart index[MD=0.50, 95%CI (-0.29, 1.30)]. Supplemented Zhenwu decoction combined with routine treatment could improve the clinical symptoms of congestive heart-failure. However, due to the low quality in methodology and reports as well as small sample size of included RCTs in this study, more randomized double-blind trials with a large sample size are still required to verify the efficiency of supplemented Zhenwu decoction for treating congestive heart-failure.

27660006|t|Identification of more objective biomarkers for Blood-Stasis syndrome diagnosis.
27660006|a|BACKGROUND: Blood-stasis syndrome (BSS) is one of the Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome differentiations that are commonly seen in stroke and ischemic heart diseases; however, the BSS differentiation criterion is not standardized. More objective biomarkers for BSS diagnosis are needed. METHODS: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or unstable angina (UA) patients with BSS and healthy controls were enrolled. The miRNA and mRNA expression profiles of UA patients and AIS patients were compared to those of healthy controls to identify the differentially expressed miRNA and mRNA of BSS. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify significantly deregulated miRNAs and mRNAs correlated to BSS. QRT-PCR was performed to validate the bioinformatics analysis results. RESULTS: Approximately 401 mRNAs and 11 miRNAs were differentially expressed in both UA and AIS patients compared to healthy controls. Gene ontology (GO) functional analysis was performed, and multiple GO terms were enriched. Among the overlapping DE miRNAs and mRNAs, miR-146b-5p, -199a-5p and 23 targeted mRNAs were pivotal genes in the BSS genomic characteristics. These 2 miRNAs and 23 mRNAs formed network-type biomarkers for BSS. CONCLUSIONS: The genomic characteristics of BSS were shown in this study. miR-146b-5p, -199a-5p and the 23 targeted mRNAs formed a diagnostic network for BSS. Further improvement and validation of this diagnostic network might lead to more objective diagnostic criteria for BSS.

27301615|t|Catalpol stimulates VEGF production via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway to improve angiogenesis in rats' stroke model.
27301615|a|ETHNOBOTANICAL RELEVANCE: Catalpol is the main active component of the radix from Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch, which has pleiotropic protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic stroke, metabolic disorders and others AIM: Catalpol has been shown to have neuroprotective, neurorepair, and angiogenesis effects following ischemic brain injury. However, its molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. In previous studies, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was found to play a role in neuroprotection and angiogenesis. This study investigated the role of catalpol in stimulating angiogenesis via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway after permanent focal cerebral ischemia (pMCAO). METHODS: Rats were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion through electrocoagulation and were treated with catalpol (5mg/kg), AG490 was also used to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3). RESULTS: Following stroke, Catalpol improved the neuroethology deficit, increased the cerebral blood flow (CBF) of infarcted brain and upregulated EPO and EPOR. AG490 suppressed the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), ultimately inhibited VEGF mRNA expression, which reduced VEGF protein expression and inhibited stroke-induced angiogenesis. However, Catalpol enhanced stroke-induced STAT3 activation and subsequently restored STAT3 activity through the recovery of STAT3 binding to VEGF. Moreover, Catalpol reversed the effect of AG490 on STAT3 activation and nuclear translocation, restored the transcriptional activity of the VEGF promoter by recruiting STAT3 to the VEGF promoter, improved VEGF mRNA and protein expression, increased angiogenesis, reduced the difference in CBF between the infarcted and intact brain and ameliorated the neuroethology behaviors after stroke. CONCLUSION: Catalpol affects neuroprotection and angiogenesis via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is mediated by STAT3 activation and VEGF expression. Catalpol may be used as a potential therapeutic drug for stroke.

27628038|t|Qing-Xin-Jie-Yu Granules in addition to conventional treatment for patients with stable coronary artery disease (QUEST Trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
27628038|a|BACKGROUND: Recurrent cardiovascular event remains high in stable coronary artery disease (SCAD), especially in patients with multiple risk factors, despite a high rate of use conventional treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a promising complementary and alternative medicine for treating SCAD, while evidence for its effect on long-term survival is limited. This study was designed to test if Chinese herbal medicine in addition to conventional treatment is more effective than conventional treatment alone in reducing major adverse cardiac event (MACE) for SCAD patients with multiple risk factors during a 1-year follow-up. METHODS: This is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 1500 patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the Qing-Xin-Jie-Yu Granules (QXJYG) or the placebo granules, twice daily for 6 months. The primary outcome is the combined outcomes including cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and revascularization. The secondary outcome is the combined outcomes including all-cause mortality, re-admission for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), heart failure, malignant supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmia influencing hemodynamics, ischemic stroke, and other thromboembolic events during 1-year follow-up. The assessment is performed at baseline (before randomization), 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomization. DISCUSSION: This is the first multicenter trial sponsored by the national funding of China to evaluate TCM in combination with conventional treatment on 1-year survival in high-risk SCAD patients. If successful, it will provide an evidence-based complementary therapeutic approach for reducing MACE from SCAD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on December 28, 2013. The registration number is ChiCTR-TRC-13004370 .

27623621|t|Efficacy and safety assessment of acupuncture and nimodipine to treat mild cognitive impairment after cerebral infarction: a randomized controlled trial.
27623621|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral infarction frequently leads to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Prompt management of MCI can prevent vascular dementia and improve patient outcome. This single center randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and nimodipine to treat post-cerebral infarction MCI. METHODS: A total of 126 Chinese patients with post-cerebral infarction MCI recruited from the First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine between April 2013 and June 2014 were randomized at 1:1: 1 ratio into nimodipine alone (30 mg/time and 3 times daily), acupuncture alone (30 min/time, 6 times/week), and nimodipine + acupuncture groups. The treatments were 3 months. Cognitive function was evaluated using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale at enrollment interview, at the end of 3-month therapy, and at the post-treatment 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: The per-protocol set included 39, 40, and 40 patients from nimodipine alone, acupuncture alone, and the combination group, respectively, was analyzed. Intra-group comparison revealed that MoCA score at the follow-up improved significantly by 15.8 ± 10.9, 20.9 ± 13.8 %, and 30.2 ± 19.7 % compared with the baseline MoCA for nimodipine alone, acupuncture alone, and the combination group, respectively. Inter-group comparison demonstrated that the combination therapy improved MoCA score (5.5 ± 2.2) at significantly higher extent than nimodipine alone (3.1 ± 1.8) and acupuncture alone (4.3 ± 2.3) at the follow-up (All P < 0.05), and significantly higher proportion of patients in acupuncture alone group (80 %) and the combination therapy group (90 %) than in nimodipine alone group (56.4 %) showed ≥12 % MoCA score improvement compared with the baseline MoCA (All P < 0.05). No adverse event was reported during the study. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture may be used as an additional therapy to conventional pharmacological treatment to further improve the clinical outcomes of patients with post-cerebral infarction MCI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( http://www.chictr.org.cn/ , Unique Identifier: ChiCTR-IOR-15007366 ).

27617986|t|Pharmacokinetic Comparison of Scutellarin and Paeoniflorin in Sham-Operated and Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury Rats after Intravenous Administration of Xin-Shao Formula.
27617986|a|Xin-Shao formula is a folk remedy widely used in China to prevent and cure stroke. Cerebral ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury often takes place during the treatment of stroke. Information about the pharmacokinetic behavior of the remedy under cerebral I/R injury conditions is lacking. The present study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetic properties of scutellarin and paeoniflorin, two major bioactive components of Xin-Shao formula, under physiological state in cerebral I/R injury rats. Neurobehavioral dysfunction was evaluated and cerebral infarcted volume was measured in middle cerebral artery occlusion I/R injury (MCAO) rats. Plasma samples were collected at various time points after a single dose (intravenous, i.v.) of Xin-Shao formula. The levels of plasma scutellarin and paeoniflorin at the designed time points were determined by a UPLC-MS/MS method, and drug concentration versus time plots were constructed to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters. Increase in terminal elimination half-life (t1/2z) and mean residence time (MRT(0-t)) of scutellarin as well as elevation in area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve from 0 h to the terminal time point (AUC(0-t)) and maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax) of paeoniflorin, along with decreased clearance of paeoniflorin and scutellarin as well as reduced apparent volume of distribution (Vz) of paeoniflorin, were observed in MCAO rats, compared with those in sham-operated animals. The elimination of scutellarin and paeoniflorin were reduced in cerebral I/R injury reduced rats.

27389185|t|Microdialysis combined with UPLC-MS/MS method for determination of tetramethylpyrazine and ferulic acid in striatum of awake and anesthetic rats subjected to cerebral ischemia.
27389185|a|A rapid, sensitive and selective ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method has been developed for the simultaneous determination and pharmacokinetic investigation of Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) and Ferulic acid (FA) in rat striatum. The method was validated over the concentration range of 1.15-505ng/mL for TMP and 3.23-101ng/mL for FA, with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 1.15ng/mL and 3.23ng/mL, respectively. This method can be successfully applied in pharmacokinetic studies of TMP and FA in striatum of awake and anesthetic rats. The cerebral blood flow velocity (CBF) during middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was monitored by Laser speckle contrast imaging, to observe whether the compatibility of TMP and FA could improve CBF against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Infarct volume was examined to evaluate severity of ischemic brain injury. The pharmacokinetic study indicated that T1/2, Cmax, MRT and AUC0-inf were changed after combined administration of TMP and FA, when compared with either drug alone both in awake and anesthetic groups. The pharmacodynamics results showed that co-administration of drugs could enhance the CBF during middle cerebral artery occlusion and reduced the infarct volume. Taken together, the compatibility treatment of TMP and FA might be a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke. Further study is required to optimize the compatibility proportion.

27324666|t|Impact of atrial fibrillation on postoperative outcomes after total knee arthroplasty-A retrospective study.
27324666|a|BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is primarily preformed among the elderly population who is commonly affected by cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a very common heart disease and its prevalence increases significantly with age. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the outcomes of patients with AF following TKA and analyze the risk factors of AF patients who underwent postoperative complication. METHODS: We designed a retrospective cohort study using data from three institutions in China. We evaluated a total of 453 AF patients who received primary TKA and 453 matched control patients. Comparisons of specific parameters between AF and non-AF cohorts were performed. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that AF patients had significantly higher odds of more intraoperative bleeding, periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), post-operative cerebral stroke (POCS), post-operative cardiovascular events (POCE) and worse SF-36 physical component score and mental score at mean 24-month after surgery, but had no increased incidence of post-operative gastrointestinal events, DVT and PE in comparison to patients without AF than those without AF disease. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors of patients who underwent severe complication. Smoking, diabetes mellitus and persistent AF were common risk factors of PJI, POCS, and POCE. Heart rate＞70/min and absence of Beta blocker use were common risk factors of POCS and POCE. Absence of LMWH bridging was risk factor of POCS. BMI >25 kg/m2 and hypertension were risk factors of POCE. CONCLUSIONS: These findings should be taken into consideration when discussing the expected outcomes of AF patients after TKA. AF disease impaired SF-36 physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) of patient after TKA.

27363623|t|Influence of the Cyclooxygenase-2 Gene -765G/C and -1195G/A Polymorphisms on Development of Ischemic Stroke.
27363623|a|BACKGROUND: Many studies have investigated the association between the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene polymorphism and ischemic stroke. However, results of these studies still remain controversial. To better explain the association between COX-2 polymorphisms (-765G/C and -1195G/A) and ischemic stroke risk, a meta-analysis was performed. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified from 4 Chinese databases (Chinese Biological Medical Literature database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database, Chongqing VIP database, and Chinese WANFANG database), PUBMED and EMBASE prior to December 2015. The strength of association between COX-2 polymorphism and ischemic stroke was evaluated by the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Inconsistency index (I(2)) and the Cochran's Q statistic were used to check heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots and Egger's regression test. RESULTS: A total of 4086 ischemic stroke cases and 4747 controls were identified. Significant association between COX-2 -765G/C polymorphism and the risk of ischemic stroke was found in Brazilians and the African-Americans. The OR of (CC+GC versus GG) for the Brazilians and African-Americans were (6.328, 95% CI = 2.295-17.448) and (1.644, 95% CI = 1.060-2.551). In addition, the recessive model of the Brazilians gave an OR of 3.621 (95% CI: 1.519-8.630). Furthermore, the (GC versus GG) and the allele model of the African-Americans were (OR: 1.615, 95% CI = 1.015-2.572) and (OR: 1.422, 95% CI = 1.033-1.957). Significant association was also observed for COX-2 -1195G/A polymorphism in the subtypes of small vessel disease (SVD) of ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that COX-2 -765G/C and -1195G/A polymorphisms may contribute to susceptibility of ischemic stroke, specifically in Brazilians and the African-Americans, and those of SVD.

27130874|t|Early prediction of functional outcome using dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in experimental stroke.
27130874|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early prediction of functional outcome in cerebral ischemia stroke using MRI remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI in terms of functional outcome of ischemia stroke. METHODS: Right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed in male SD rats (n=50), followed by withdrawal of the occluding filament after 3 (n = 10), 4 (n = 10), 5 (n = 10), 6 (n = 10) or 7 (n = 10) h to establish ischemia and reperfusion stroke. DCE and conventional MRI were performed in each animal 60 ± 15 min before and after reperfusion. The outcome was assessed by the modified Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS) (before reperfusion and at 72 h after reperfusion) and the infarct volume. Comparisons of functional prognosis and DCE parameters (K(trans), Ve and Kep) were performed using binary logistic regression and operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: DCE parameters results indicated that blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability increased with prolonged reperfusion timing. Using binary logistic regression analysis on stroke characteristics (reperfusion timing, infarct volume) and BBB permeability parameters (drK(trans)subcortex, drK(trans)cortex, drVesubcortex, drVecortex, drKepsubcortex and drKepcortex) as covariates , the results demonstrated that reperfusion timing, infarct volume, drK(trans)subcortex and drKepsubcortex were independent factors that were associated with prognosis (OR=0.01, OR=0.23, OR=245.23, OR=1.29). ROC analysis indicated that a drK(trans)subcortex threshold of 0.88 with a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 85.2% and a drKepsubcortex threshold of -0.25 with a sensitivity of 69.6% and a specificity of 70.4% for differentiation between favourable and unfavourable prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative DCE-MRI can be used to predict the functional outcomes of cerebral ischemia injury.

27857744|t|Regional brain structural abnormality in ischemic stroke patients: a voxel-based morphometry study.
27857744|a|Our previous study used regional homogeneity analysis and found that activity in some brain areas of patients with ischemic stroke changed significantly. In the current study, we examined structural changes in these brain regions by taking structural magnetic resonance imaging scans of 11 ischemic stroke patients and 15 healthy participants, and analyzing the data using voxel-based morphometry. Compared with healthy participants, patients exhibited higher gray matter density in the left inferior occipital gyrus and right anterior white matter tract. In contrast, gray matter density in the right cerebellum, left precentral gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus was less in ischemic stroke patients. The changes of gray matter density in the middle frontal gyrus were negatively associated with the clinical rating scales of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (r = -0.609, P = 0.047) and the left middle temporal gyrus was negatively correlated with the clinical rating scales of the nervous functional deficiency scale (r = -0.737, P = 0.010). Our findings can objectively identify the functional abnormality in some brain regions of ischemic stroke patients.

27033360|t|Neuro-protective Mechanisms of Lycium barbarum.
27033360|a|Neuronal diseases, including retinal disorders, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury, affect a large number of people worldwide and cause heavy social and economic burdens. Although many efforts have been made by scientists and clinicians to develop novel drug and healthcare strategies, few of them received satisfactory outcomes to date. Lycium barbarum is a traditional homology of medicine and food in Chinese medicine, with the capability to nourish the eyes, liver and kidneys. Recent studies have also explored its powerful neuro-protective effects on a number of neuronal diseases. In the current review, we collected key recent findings regarding the neuro-protective effects and mechanisms of L. barbarum derivatives, primarily its polysaccharide (LBP) , in some common diseases of the nervous system. A comprehensive comparison with currently available drugs has also been discussed. In general, LBP is a promising neuronal protector with potent ameliorative effects on key pathological events, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and cell death with minimal side effects.

27652041|t|Clinical re-evaluation of removing blood stasis therapy in treating acute intracerebral hemorrhage safety and efficacy: a protocol for a randomized, controlled, multicenter study (CRRICH Trial).
27652041|a|BACKGROUND: Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) is one of the most devastating forms of stroke. Currently, no specific therapies for HICH except general medical care. However, in China, medicine of promoting blood circulation (PBC) and removing blood stasis (RBS) are widely and efficiently used to treat HICH and become a potentially effective treatment for the secondary effects of HICH to alleviate brain injury, accelerate neuronal recovery, and improve the prognosis. In order to evaluate the safety and effect of PBC and RBS herbal drugs, we design a prospective, randomized, open, double-blind controlled clinical trial on the hematoma enlargement in HICH patients treating with PBC and RBS herbal medicine within 6 h time window from the symptom onset. METHODS/DESIGN: A multicenter, three-group, prospective, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients aged 18 or older with HICH confirmed by CT scan within 6 h from the onset are included. 360 patients will be randomized to 3 groups (PBC & RBS & Placebo) within 6 h of ictus. Stratified block randomization is undertaken using a sequentially numbered and opaque envelope. All subjects must take medicine within 6 h of ictus and have another CT scan at about 24 h to confirm hematoma expansion. A postal questionnaire to the patients to evaluate their recorvery at 3 months. Primary outcome is the percent change in the volume of hematoma at 24 h. Secondary outcomes include: mortality, disability, serious adverse events, etc. CONCLUSIONS: The CRRICH Trial is expected to confirm the safety and effect of acute intracerebral hemorrhage treated within 6 h of ictus with "RBS" therapy and to determine whether the traditional therapy can cause hematoma growth after intracerebral hemorrhage. DISCUSSIONS: This is the first prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate herbal medicine whether can induce the incidence of hematoma enlargement of AICH patient within the 6 h time window from onset. We need the data to keep the herbal clinical usage safety. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01918722.

28925134|t|[A multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial for effect of Longxue Tongluo capsule in treatment of patients of atherosclerotic thrombotic cerebral infarction with blood-stasis syndrome in convalescence].
28925134|a|To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Longxue Tongluo capsule on patients of atherosclerotic thrombotic cerebral infarction convalescence with blood-stasis syndrome, a double-blind, randomized controlled, multi-center clinical trial was conducted. A total of 160 eligible patients were randomly divided into treatment group and control group, with 80 patients in each group, and all of them were orally given Troxerutin pill(three pills each time, three times daily). Longxue Tongluo capsule was applied in the treatment group, while placebo was applied in the control group(two capsules each time, three times daily) for 4 weeks. Main outcomes were measured by ITT analysis. The neurological function deficits scale showed a decrease of 5.17±2.60 in the treatment group, while 4.31±2.31 in the control group, with significant differences between the two groups(P<0.05); the reduction rate in the treatment group (37.2±15.8)% was significantly higher than that in the control group (29.9±15.3)%(P<0.05). In terms of the comprehensive curative effect by ITT, the effective rates in the treatment and control group were 31.6% and 13.5%, respectively(P<0.05). With respect to the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine syndrome by ITT, the total effective rate of the treatment group was significantly higher than the control group 88.2% vs 68.9%, P<0.05. Three cases of adverse events occurred in this study, including 1 case of diarrhea in treatment group and 2 cases of skin itch and upper respiratory infection in control group. In conclusion, Longxue Tongluo capsule is effective and safe in the treatment of patients of atherosclerotic thrombotic cerebral infarction convalescence with blood-stasis syndrome, and can effectively alleviate the patients' nerve function defect degree and invalidism, with a good effect on blood stasis syndrome.

27589720|t|Ruscogenin Attenuates Cerebral Ischemia-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction by Suppressing TXNIP/NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and the MAPK Pathway.
27589720|a|Ruscogenin, an important steroid sapogenin derived from Ophiopogon japonicus, has been shown to inhibit cerebral ischemic injury. However, its potential molecular action on blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction after stroke remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ruscogenin on BBB dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R)-injured mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-injured mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3). The results demonstrated that administration of ruscogenin (10 mg/kg) decreased the brain infarction and edema, improved neurological deficits, increased cerebral brain flow (CBF), ameliorated histopathological damage, reduced evans blue (EB) leakage and upregulated the expression of tight junctions (TJs) in MCAO/R-injured mice. Meanwhile, ruscogenin (0.1-10 µM) treatment increased cell viability and trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value, decreased sodium fluorescein leakage, and modulated the TJs expression in OGD/R-induced bEnd.3 cells. Moreover, ruscogenin also inhibited the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and caspase-1, and markedly suppressed the expression of Nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and thiredoxin-interactive protein (TXNIP) in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, ruscogenin decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inhibited the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in OGD/R-induced bEnd.3 cells. Our findings provide some new insights into its potential application for the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke.

27566677|t|An investigation of the use of acupuncture in stroke patients in Taiwan: a national cohort study.
27566677|a|BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is considered a complementary and alternative medicine in many countries. The purpose of this study was to report the pattern of acupuncture use and associated factors in patients with stroke. METHODS: We used claims data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and identified 285001 new-onset stroke patients in 2000-2008 from 23 million people allover Taiwan. The use of acupuncture treatment after stroke within one year was identified. We compared sociodemographics, coexisting medical conditions, and stroke characteristics between stroke patients who did and did not receive acupuncture treatment. RESULTS: The use of acupuncture in stroke patients increased from 2000 to 2008. Female gender, younger age, white-collar employee status, higher income, and residence in areas with more traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physicians were factors associated with acupuncture use in stroke patients. Ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.21, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.15-1.28), having no renal dialysis (OR 2.76, 95 % CI 2.45-3.13), receiving rehabilitation (OR 3.20, 95 % CI 3.13-3.27) and longer hospitalization (OR 1.23, 95 % CI 1.19-1.27) were also associated with acupuncture use. Stroke patients using rehabilitation services were more likely to have more acupuncture visits and a higher expenditure on acupuncture compared with stroke patients who did not receive rehabilitation services. CONCLUSIONS: The application of acupuncture in stroke patients is well accepted and increasing in Taiwan. The use of acupuncture in stroke patients is associated with sociodemographic factors and clinical characteristics.

27288754|t|Panax notoginseng saponins provide neuroprotection by regulating NgR1/RhoA/ROCK2 pathway expression, in vitro and in vivo.
27288754|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) extracted from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.H. Chen (Araliaceae), which has been extensively used in treating coronary heart disease, ischemic cerebrovascular disease and hemorrhagic disorders in China over hundreds of years. AIMS OF THE STUDY: This study explored whether panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) provided neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the expressions of NgR1, RhoA, and ROCK2 following middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury in SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to determine successful middle cerebral artery occlusion establishment in sham-operated and operated Sprague-Dawley rats 1 day after injury. The rats were randomly separated into sham, model, NEP1-40, PNS, and NEP1-40 plus PNS (N+P) groups. After 7 days of treatment, body mass and neurological deficit scores were analyzed. Tissues were harvested and analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis, western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The optimal drug concentration of NEP1-40 and PNS on SH-SY5Y cells exposed to OGD/R injury was determined by CCK8 analysis. qRT-PCR was used to measure mRNA expression profiles of NgR1, RhoA, and ROCK2 in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to OGD/R. RESULTS: The results showed that MCAO surgery successfully produced an infarct, and the PNS, NEP1-40, and N+P groups exhibited increased body mass and ameliorated neurological deficits compared with the model group. NEP1-40 treatment markedly reduced NgR1 and RhoA overexpression when compared to the model group, although there was no significant difference in ROCK2 expression. PNS and N+P treatment significantly decreased NgR1, RhoA, and ROCK2 overexpression compared with the model group. However, N+P treatment did not result in a synergistic effect, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qRT-PCR. Following optimal administration of PNS (160μg/ml) and NEP1-40 (10ng/ml) on SH-SY5Y cells exposed to OGD/R injury, cell viability in the NEP1-40, PNS, and N+P groups significantly increased compared with the model group, as assessed by CCK8 analysis. Additionally, NgR1, RhoA, and ROCK2 mRNA expression profiles were significantly less in the NEP1-40, PNS, and N+P groups compared with the model group. CONCLUSION: PNS provided neuroprotective effects in a rat model of cerebral ischemia and SH-SY5Y cells exposed to oxygen/glucose deprivation injury by inhibiting the overexpression of NgR1, RhoA, and ROCK2.

27542834|t|Association study of polymorphisms in the ABO gene with ischemic stroke in the Chinese population.
27542834|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is the main cause of mortality and disability in older people worldwide. Recently epidemiological studies indicate that ischemic stroke is a complex disorder with a strong genetic component. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) locus in ABO gene. Our study examined the association between four variants in the ABO gene and the risk of ischemic stroke and its subtypes, large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) and small-vessel diseases (SVD) in the Chinese population. METHODS: In this case-control study, we recruited 1897 subjects, including 979 healthy controls and 918 ischemic stroke patients (465 with LAA and 453 with SVD). We selected four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs579459, rs651007, rs514659 and rs529565) of the ABO gene and performed genotyping assays to assess the association with ischemic stroke and its subtypes. RESULTS: We found three polymorphisms, rs579459 and rs651007 were significantly associated with LAA using additive model and rs529565 was significantly associated with LAA using additive and dominant models. And we failed to find any significant association between these SNPs and ischemic stroke and SVD in the Chinese population. However, after the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the P-values of these SNPs failed to exceed significant threshold under any models. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that genetic variations of ABO gene may contribute to susceptibility of LAA but not ischemic stroke and SVD in the Chinese population. Our preliminary results should be further validated in prospective independent studies with expanded sample size.

27184188|t|Pheretima aspergillum decoction suppresses inflammation and relieves asthma in a mouse model of bronchial asthma by NF-κB inhibition.
27184188|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Guang-Pheretima, the live form of the earthworm Pheretima aspergillum, is a traditional Chinese medicine commonly used for the treatment of asthma, cough, stroke, epilepsy and other diseases due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-asthmatic, anti-seizure, thrombolytic and diuretic properties. Although Guang-Pheretima is effective in the relief of asthma, its pharmacological activity and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Hence, we investigated the effects of a Pheretima aspergillum decoction (PAD) against inflammation in a model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma in BALB/c mice, as well as the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway involved in this process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OVA was used to sensitize and challenge the airway of the mice, and PAD was administrated by gavage. We measured airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in the mice 24h following a final methacholine challenge with whole-body plethysmography. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), serum and pulmonary tissues were collected 48h after the last challenge. The levels of inflammatory factors and the related mRNAs were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. The number of differential inflammatory cells in the BALF was counted. Serum total and OVA-specific IgE levels were measured with ELISA. The activation of NF-κB signaling in the lung was detected by western blotting. In addition, the lung tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or periodic acid Schiff stain for histopathological examination. RESULTS: PAD treatment significantly alleviated AHR in the asthmatic mice, decreased the mRNA and protein levels of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 and downregulated IgE. In addition, PAD treatment attenuated mucus secretion and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung while inhibiting the activation of NF-κB signaling. CONCLUSIONS: PAD effectively inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling in the lungs of mice with OVA-induced asthma, and mitigated AHR and Th2 type inflammatory reactions. Therefore, PAD may serve as a drug candidate for asthma treatment.

27524193|t|[Effects of functional electrical stimulation based on normal gait pattern on walking function in subjects with recovery of stroke].
27524193|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of functional electrical stimulation(FES) based on normal gait pattern on walking function in subjects with recovery of stroke. METHODS: From December 2010 to January 2013, 58 patients with recovery of stroke were recruited from the Rehabilitation Medicine Departments of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital and the Guangdong Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital. And the Minimize software was used to divide them randomly into 1 of the 3 groups: four-channel FES group (n=29), single-channel FES group (n=15) and placebo electrical group (n=14) at the rate of 2∶1∶1. All received standardized rehabilitation program. The four-channel FES group received four-channel FES treatment based on normal gait pattern, the single-channel FES group received single-channel FES treatment, the placebo electrical group received the same electrical stimulation as the four-channel FES group, but without current output when stimulating. Stimulation lasted for 30 min/d, 1 session / d, 5 d/w for 3 weeks. All subjects in the three groups received Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale (FMA), Berg Balance scale (BBS), gait speed during a 10-meter walking test, muscle co-activation index (CI) of the lower extremity during walking and the Modified Barthel index (MBI) assessments before and after 3 weeks treatment. RESULTS: Before treatment, the FMA, BBS and gait speed during a 10-meter walking test of the four-channel FES group were (23.0±2.2), (31±71) and (0.23±0.10), respectively. After 3 weeks treatment, the scores were improved to (28.4±1.5), (42±6)and(0.43±0.09), respectively. And the FMA, BBS and gait speed during a 10-meter walking test of the ingle-channel FES group increased from (21.9±3.4), (31±6) and (0.24±0.09) to (26.6±1.8), (38±5) and (0.34±0.08), respectively. The placebo electrical group increased from (23.6±3.0), (33±5) and (0.25±0.09) respectively to (26.0±2.4), (36±4) and (0.29±0.08). And the FMA, BBS and gait speed during a 10-meter walking test of the three groups were significantly higher than those in pre-treatment (P<0.05), and the scores in four-channel FES group were significantly higher than the single-channel group and the placebo electrical group's (P<0.05). The MBI score of the three groups were all improved, but it didn't show difference among the three groups (P>0.05). The results of surface electromyography showed significant decrease in CI of quadriceps / hamstring of the 3 groups, and the four-channel FES group had more significant decrease than the other two groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Functional electrical stimulation based on normal gait pattern could improve walking function in subjects with recovery of stroke.

27153002|t|Predictive role of CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores on stroke and thromboembolism in patients without atrial fibrillation: a meta-analysis.
27153002|a|OBJECTIVE: CHA2DS2-VASc is the extension of the CHADS2 score developed by Birmingham 2009. This risk stratification schema is often used in clinical setting when considering additional risk factors for developing stroke in AF patients. However, its role in the non-AF population is unknown. This study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of the CHADS2 and the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring systems. METHODS: Studies designed for CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc score in stratifying the risks for stroke development in non-AF patients were included. RESULTS: Among the 114 studies identified, six trials were chosen finally and included for meta-analysis. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc was 2.86 (95% CI =1.83-4.28) and 2.80 (95% CI =1.83-4.28), respectively. CHA2DS2-VASc score was of better sensitivity than CHADS2 score (0.920 vs. 0.768). However, both scores were showed to have inherent heterogeneity and poor specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Though having good diagnostic accuracy, the clinical application of the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores in predicting risk of stroke development in non-AF patients still needs further validation. Key message The overall diagnostic accuracy of CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc in stroke-risk stratification was good in patients with non-atrial fibrillation.

26902972|t|Pulse pressure as an independent predictor of stroke: a systematic review and a meta-analysis.
26902972|a|BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that pulse pressure (PP) is a strong cardiovascular diseases' risk factor. We systematically evaluated all relevant studies to determine whether PP can be used as an independent predictor of stroke and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: A meta-analysis was performed by searching the published literature using MEDLINE, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases up to December 15, 2015. We measured the effect size expressed by hazard ratio (HR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). Eleven publications were included in the analysis. Pooled results demonstrated that 10 mmHg increase in PP was associated with increased risk of stroke occurrence (pooled HR 1.046, 95 % CI 1.025-1.068, P < 0.001). Additionally, systolic blood pressure (SBP) (pooled HR 1.053, 95 % CI 1.033-1.073, P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DPB) (pooled HR 1.056, 95 % CI 1.038-1.074, P < 0.001) were found to be significant predictors for stroke. We did not find a significant association between PP and all-cause mortality (pooled HR 1.022, 95 % CI 0.983-1.063, P = 0.270). We found SBP (pooled HR 1.008, 95 % CI 1.002-1.014, P = 0.012), but not DBP (pooled HR 1.023, 95 % CI 0.964-1.085, P = 0.451) to be significantly associated with all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Current data confirms that PP is an independent risk factor for stroke but is not a predictor of mortality.

26974548|t|High Intracranial Pressure Induced Injury in the Healthy Rat Brain.
26974548|a|OBJECTIVES: We recently showed that increased intracranial pressure to 50 mm Hg in the healthy rat brain results in microvascular shunt flow characterized by tissue hypoxia, edema, and increased blood-brain barrier permeability. We now determined whether increased intracranial pressure results in neuronal injury by Fluoro-Jade stain and whether changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen suggest nonnutritive microvascular shunt flow. DESIGN: Intracranial pressure was elevated by a reservoir of artificial cerebrospinal fluid connected to the cisterna magna. Arterial blood gases, cerebral arterial-venous oxygen content difference, and cerebral blood flow by MRI were measured. Fluoro-Jade stain neurons were counted in histologic sections of the right and left dorsal and lateral cortices and hippocampus. SETTING: University laboratory. SUBJECTS: Male Sprague Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Arterial pressure support if needed by IV dopamine infusion and base deficit corrected by sodium bicarbonate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fluoro-Jade stain neurons increased 2.5- and 5.5-fold at intracranial pressures of 30 and 50 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressures of 57 ± 4 (mean ± SEM) and 47 ± 6 mm Hg, respectively (p < 0.001) (highest in the right and left cortices). Voxel frequency histograms of cerebral blood flow showed a pattern consistent with microvascular shunt flow by dispersion to higher cerebral blood flow at high intracranial pressure and decreased cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: High intracranial pressure likely caused neuronal injury because of a transition from normal capillary flow to nonnutritive microvascular shunt flow resulting in tissue hypoxia and edema, and it is manifest by a reduction in the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen.

27446275|t|Electroacupuncture improves cognitive ability following cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury via CaM-CaMKIV-CREB signaling in the rat hippocampus.
27446275|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on cognitive deficits, and the underlying mechanism following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) via the calmodulin (CaM)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CaMKIV)-cyclic adenosine monophosphate response elements binding protein (CREB) intracellular signaling pathway in the hippocampus. In total, 45 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups, namely the sham group, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group and the MCAO + EA group. Rats in the MCAO and MCAO + EA groups were modeled for post-stroke cognitive impairment. EA was performed at the Baihui and Shenting acupuncture points for 30 min/day for one week in the MCAO + EA group. Behavioral testing was analyzed using a step-down apparatus, while 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride was used to detect the infarct volume and lesion size. In addition, CaM activity was assessed by cyclic nucleotide-dependent phosphodiesterase analysis, and the protein expression levels of CaM, CaMKIV, phosphorylated (p)-CaMKIV, CREB and p-CREB were analyzed by western blot analysis. The cerebral I/R injured rat model in the MCAO group was established successfully with regard to the infarct volume and neuronal lesion size, as compared with the sham group. EA was demonstrated to effectively improve the cognitive ability, as measured by the step-down apparatus test, and decrease the infarct volume when compared with the MCAO group (P<0.05). The step-down apparatus test for the EA-treated rats revealed improved learning and reduced memory impairment when compared with the MCAO group. Furthermore, CaM activity and CaM protein expression levels in the MCAO + EA group were lower compared with those in the MCAO group (P<0.05). By contrast, the protein expression levels of CaMKIV, p-CaMKIV, CREB and p-CREB were significantly reduced in the MCAO group when compared with the sham group (P<0.05), although the expression levels increased following EA treatment when compared with the MCAO group (P<0.05). Therefore, cognitive repair benefited from EA, and the main intracellular signaling pathway in the hippocampus was mediated by CaM-CaMKIV-CREB. EA effectively inhibited the expression and activity of CaM, while further enhancing the expression of CaMKIV and CREB, and their associated phosphorylated functions.

27495109|t|Altered structural and functional connectivity between the bilateral primary motor cortex in unilateral subcortical stroke: A multimodal magnetic resonance imaging study.
27495109|a|A large number of functional imaging studies have focused on the understanding of motor-related neural activities after ischemic stroke. However, the knowledge is still limited in the structural and functional changes of the interhemispheric connections of the bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) and their potential influence on motor function recovery following stroke.Twenty-four stroke patients with right hemispheric subcortical infarcts and 25 control subjects were recruited to undergo multimodal magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Structural impairments between the bilateral M1s were measured by fractional anisotropy. Functional changes of the bilateral M1s were assessed via M1-M1 resting-state functional connectivity. Task-evoked activation analysis was applied to identify the roles of the bilateral hemispheres in motor function recovery. Compared with control subjects, unilateral subcortical stroke patients revealed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy and functional connectivity between the bilateral M1s. Stroke patients also revealed higher activations in multiple brain regions in both hemispheres and that more regions were located in the contralesional hemisphere.This study increased our understanding of the structural and functional alterations between the bilateral M1s that occur in unilateral subcortical stroke and provided further evidence for the compensatory role played by the contralesional hemisphere for these alterations during motor function recovery.

28914030|t|[Preliminary investigation on mechanism of Naoxintong capsule's preventive treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular disease based on serum proteomics].
28914030|a|Naoxintong capsule has beneficial effects for activating blood circulation, dispersing blood stasis and dredging collateral. It is widely used in the treatment of coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, stroke and cardiovascular disease. However, the pharmacodynamic basis and possible mechanism of its preventive effects are not clear. In this study, 10 male and 10 female C57BL/6 mice were used, and were randomly divided into the control group (saline) and Naoxintong group. Adaptively fed for 7 days in common conditions, mice were given Naoxintong capsule or saline for 3 days via intragastric administration. Serum was collected from 6 mice in each group 1 h after the last administration. Serum proteins were prepared to do two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Then image analysis and mass spectrometry detection were carried out to screen and identify the differentially expressed proteins and make bioinformatics analysis. It was found that 24 differentially expressed proteins between Naoxintong group and control group. Compared with the control group, 12 proteins were increased, and 12 were decreased. The proteins were involved in apoptosis signal pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor signal transduction pathway, in which vasohibin-1 is a negative feedback regulation factor in angiogenesis. Western blot showed that the expression of vasohibin-1 in Naoxintong group was reduced, which is consistent with the result in two-dimensional electrophoresis. Serum proteins expression is different between Naoxintong and control groups. The targets of these differentially expressed proteins include endothelial cells, inflammatory cells and platelets. The changes on proteins showed that Naoxintong capsule may ameliorate coronary heart disease and ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and provide potential biological markers to prevent ischemic disease.

27460564|t|Association study of C-reactive protein associated gene HNF1A with ischemic stroke in Chinese population.
27460564|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a life-threatening condition due to obstructed blood supply of the brain. Elevation of plasma C-reactive protein, an important inflammatory marker, was known to associate with increased risk of ischemic stroke. Previous studies reported association between genetic variants of HNF1A and plasma level of C-reactive protein. The HNF1A gene encodes a hepatocyte transcription factor which might have regulatory effects on C-reactive protein synthesis in liver. Therefore, the C-reactive protein associated gene HNF1A seems to be a promising candidate gene for ischemic stroke. RESULTS: We used HNF1A as a candidate gene of ischemic stroke and evaluated seven common variants of HNF1A for their contribution to ischemic stroke. The association analysis of HNF1A variants with ischemic stroke was performed in a Chinese population with 918 cases and 979 controls. For total ischemic stroke and large vessel disease subtype, none of variants exceeded significant threshold. For small vessel disease subtype of ischemic stroke, the G allele of rs7953249 showed nominal association (OR = 0.82, p = 0.04) after data adjustment for conventional risk factors. However, our preliminary results did not survived bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Common genetic variants of HNF1A showed nominal association with small vessel disease subtype of ischemic stroke though not survived bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The association between HNF1A and ischemic stroke is limited by small effects of individual SNPs. Our study provided additional genetic evidences to understand the role of HNF1A gene and C-reactive protein underlying ischemic stroke.

27163672|t|Neuroprotective effects of Danggui-Jakyak-San on rat stroke model through antioxidant/antiapoptotic pathway.
27163672|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Dangui-Jakyak-San (DJ) is a traditional Korean medicinal polyherb, prescribed typically in patients with insufficient blood supply in Eastern Asia. The DJ also has been reported to have neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo studies. AIM OF STUDY: The therapeutic potential of DJ was examined in stroke rat model, in comparison with donepezil, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ischemic stroke rat model was induced by surgery of permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (pMCAO). The model was orally administered with distilled water (pMCAO control), donepezil at 10mg/kg (Donepezil) and DJ at 200, 100 and 50mg/kg (DJ 200, DJ 100 and DJ 50, respectively). Sham had the same surgery excepting for the pMCAO, and it was administered with distilled water (sham control). RESULTS: After the administration for 28 days, the groups of DJ exhibited dose-dependent reduction in infarct/defect volumes with improvement in sensorimotor and cognitive motor function, comparing to pMCAO control. The DJ treatments seemed to enhance antiapoptotic and antioxidant effects; increases in antiapoptotic expressions (STAT3 and Pim-1) and decreases in lipid peroxidation (MDA) together with increases in contents of endogenous antioxidant (GSH) and activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and SOD). The histopathological analyses revealed significant reduction in neuronal apoptosis (caspase-3 and PARP) and neuronal degradation with atrophy and degeneration, in the DJ treatments. Furthermore, the oxidative stresses (nitrotyrosine as an iNOS factor and 4-HNE as a marker of lipid peroxidation) were observed mild. Although the similar neuroprotective effects were observed, the body weight loss was scarcely alleviated in Donepezil comparing to pMCAO control. CONCLUSION: These suggest that DJ ameliorate the neurological dysfunction of cerebral ischemia through augmentation of antioxidant defense system and up-regulation of STAT3 and Pim-1.

27132713|t|Protective effect of n-butyl alcohol extracts from Rhizoma Pinelliae Pedatisectae against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.
27132713|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rhizoma Pinelliae Pedatisectae (RPP) has been commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treatment of various neurological related diseases. However, the mechanisms have not been fully clarified yet. The present study was designed to investigate the therapeutic effect of RPP against cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats models, and more importantly, to explore the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion was established through the classic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2h, followed by 24h reperfusion. Rats were orally given different doses of n-butyl alcohol extracts (NBES) of RPP or saline for one week before induction of ischemia. Neurological defect scoring, cerebral infarct volume, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory reaction and nerve cell apoptosis were then estimated. RESULTS: It showed that NBES could alleviate in a dose-dependent manner neurological deficit and reduce the infarct volume in vivo. The protective effects of NBES were associated with increased Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased malonaldehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels. In addition, ischemia-induced neuron apoptosis was inhibited by NBES pretreatment, and western blot showed NBES upregulated expressions of B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and downregulated Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) expression. CONCLUSION: NBES prevent cerebral I/R injury by alleviating neuronal oxidative injury, inflammatory reaction and neuron apoptosis. The research for the traditional use of RPP provided certain theoretical basis.

27428543|t|Adjuvant Chinese Herbal Products for Preventing Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.
27428543|a|OBJECTIVE: Chinese herbal products (CHPs) are widely used for atrial fibrillation (AF) in Taiwan. We investigated the effect of adjuvant CHPs in preventing ischemic stroke in patients with AF. METHODS: Taiwanese patients in the Health Insurance Database newly diagnosed with AF during 2000-2011 were enrolled. Medication treatment with/without CHPs was administered within 7 days after the AF diagnosis. The clinical endpoint was an ischemic stroke. The Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and Student t test were used to examine differences between the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and non-TCM cohorts. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess the risk for ischemic stroke between two cohorts. RESULTS: Three hundred and eleven patients underwent TCM treatment and 1715 patients did not. Compared to non-TCM users, TCM users had a lower incidence of stroke (12.59% vs. 1.93%, respectively) and lower risk of stroke [CHA2DS2-VASc score = 0-2 (hazard ratio = 0.20; 95% confidence interval = 0.06-0.65)]. Compared to non-TCM users, the stroke risk was significantly lower in TCM users with AF who were female or younger than 65 years, but not in males, people more than 65 years old, or people with comorbidities. Compared to TCM users, non-TCM users who received conventional treatment had a higher ischemic stroke risk. The risk for AF-related hospitalization was significantly lower in TCM users (0.64%) than in non-TCM users (38.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Users of TCM with AF have a lower risk of new-onset ischemic stroke. Therefore, adjuvant CHP therapy may have a protective effect and may be used in AF patients to prevent ischemic stroke.

29231411|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diseases and effects of the manipulations to promote qi by filiform needles, with the help of data mining technique. METHODS: Literature about different manipulations to promote qi by filiform needles in recent 60 years was collected in China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI). Then databases were established to mine the relativities among the diseases, subjects, acupoints selection law,routes and directions of meridian qi and effects. RESULTS: ①Total 489 articles were included. The basic manipulations with the frequency of 630 were on the top. The auxiliary and four methods of Feijingzouqi respectively appeared 70 times. The diseases in the internal medicine were treated with the basic and auxiliary methods of the higher frequencies, 311 and 44 times separately. While the four methods of Feijingzouqi were mostly used in the surgical area, 37 timestotally. ②The diseases treated from high to low by lifting, thrusting and twirling represented retention of urine, sequelae of stroke, pain in waist and lower limbs, of which the effect for retention of urine was better than those of the other two, and the lifting and thrusting method was superior to twirling. ③As for the auxiliary methods, 25 times were found about vibration needling; 18 times, twisting. The highest frequency of 6 times for the vibration needling was on the sequelae of stroke; while 4 times for the twisting, stranguria. ④As to the four methods of Feijingzouqi, Cangguitanxue was most frequently applied, and its highest frequency of 18 was on bi syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Manipulations to promote qi by filiform needles are crucial to achieving the effects of acupuncture. The basic methods are widely used in clinic and have been seen good efficacy. While the auxiliary means assist to promote qi to stimulate the body,among which the four methods of Feijingzouqi are mainly to smooth the meridians and drive qi of patients with surgical diseases and take meridian blocking the priority.

29231403|t|[Post-stroke dysphagia treated with acupuncture of meridian differentiation:a randomized controlled trial].
29231403|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect on post-stroke dysphagia treated with acupuncture of meridian differentiation. METHODS: One hundred and thirty patients of post-stroke dysphagia were randomized into an observation group (67 cases) and a control group (63 cases). Conventional medication and rehabilitation training were applied in the two groups. In the observation group, acupuncture based on meridian differentiation was adopted. The main acupoints were Neiguan (PC 6), Shuigou (GV 26), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Fengchi (GB 20), Lianquan (CV 23), Jialianquan (Extra), Jinjin (EX-HN 12), Yuye (EX-HN 13), etc. The supplementary points were selected according to different patterns/syndromes. In the control group, the points were selected 5 cm lateral to the acupoints used in the observation groups and stimulated with shallow puncture. The needles were retained for 30 min, once daily, 5 treatments a week and continuously for 6 weeks in the two groups. Separately, before treatment, in 6 weeks after treatment and in follow-up after 3 months, the standardized swallowing assessment (SSA), the video fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), the modified Barthel index (MBI) and the swallowing related quality of life (SWAL-QOL) were observed in the two groups and the efficacy was assessed. RESULTS: In 6 weeks of treatment, the scores of SSA, VFSS, MBI and SWAL-QOL were improved apparently as compared with those before treatment (P<0.01, P<0.05) in the patients of the two groups. The results in the observation group were better apparently than those in the control group (P<0.01, P<0.05). In follow-up after 3 months, the scores of SSA, MBI and SWAL-QOL were improved apparently as compared with those before treatment in thepatients of the two groups (all P<0.01), in which, MBI score was improved apparently as compared with that in 6 weeks of treatment in the patients of the two groups (both P<0.05). Those scores in the observation group were improved apparently as compared with those in the control group (P<0.01, P<0.05). In 6 weeks of treatment and in 3 months of follow-up, the effective rates in the observation group were 91.8% (56/61) and 93.4% (57/61), better than 80.0% (44/55) and 85.5% (47/55) in the control group separately, indicating the significant difference (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The acupuncture of meridian differentiation improves significantly swallowing function and survival quality in patients of stroke.

27391841|t|Effects of Xiaoshuan enteric-coated capsule on neurovascular functions assessed by quantitative multiparametric MRI in a rat model of permanent cerebral ischemia.
27391841|a|BACKGROUND: Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula for treating stroke-induced disability. Xiaoshuan enteric-coated capsule (XSECC), derived from the formula BYHWD, is a drug approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for stroke management. To further investigate the potential protective effects of XSECC on neurovascular functions, we endeavour to monitor the neurovascular functions using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and evaluated histopathological changes of neurovascular unit (NVU) after stroke. METHODS: Ischemic stroke was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). XSECC (420 mg/kg) was orally administered 2 h after stroke and daily thereafter. T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), T2 relaxometry mapping and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to measure cerebral infarct volume, edema and white matter fiber integrity, respectively. Neurochemical metabolite levels were monitored by (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). Arterial spin labeling (ASL) - cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements and structural magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images provided real-time and dynamic information about vascular hemodynamic dysfunction on the 3rd, 7th and 14th days after pMCAO. At the last imaging time point, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to test the microscopic and ultrastructural changes of NVU. RESULTS: T2WI, T2 relaxometry mapping and Fractional anisotropy (FA) in DTI showed that XSECC significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume, relieved edema and alleviated nerve fiber injuries, respectively. (1)H-MRS provided information about improvement of neuronal/glial metabolism after XSECC treatment. Moreover, ASL - CBF measurements combined with MRA showed that XSECC significantly increased CBF and vascular signal strength and alleviated ischemia-induced morphological changes of arteries in ischemic hemisphere within 14 days after stroke. In addition, neuron specific nuclear protein (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), CD34 staining and TEM detection indicated that XSECC not only ameliorated neuronal injury, but also reduced endothelial damage and inhibited astrocyte proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that XSECC has multi-target neurovascular protective effects on ischemic stroke, which may be closely correlated with the improvement of cerebral blood supply and neuronal/glial metabolism.

27133299|t|Associations of CYP3A4, NR1I2, CYP2C19 and P2RY12 polymorphisms with clopidogrel resistance in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke.
27133299|a|AIM: There is a high incidence of the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel resistance (CR) in Asian populations. Because clopidogrel is a prodrug, polymorphisms of genes encoding the enzymes involved in its biotransformation may be the primary influential factors. The goal of this study was to investigate the associations of polymorphisms of CYP3A4, NR1I2, CYP2C19 and P2RY12 genes with CR in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS: A total of 191 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled. The patients were treated with clopidogrel for at least 5 days. Platelet function was measured by light transmission aggregometry. The SNPs NR1I2 (rs13059232), CYP3A4(*)1G (rs2242480), CYP2C19(*)2 (rs4244285) and P2RY12 (rs2046934) were genotyped. RESULTS: The CR rate in this population was 36%. The CYP2C19(*)2 variant was a risk factor for CR ((*)2/(*)2+wt/(*)2 vs wt/wt, OR: 2.366, 95% CI: 1.180-4.741, P=0.014), whereas the CYP3A4(*)1G variant had a protective effect on CR ((*)1/(*)1 vs (*)1G/(*)1G+(*)1/(*)1G, OR: 2.360, 95% CI: 1.247-4.468, P=0.008). The NR1I2 (rs13059232) polymorphism was moderately associated with CR (CC vs TT+TC, OR: 0.533, 95% CI: 0.286-0.991, P=0.046). The C allele in P2RY12 (rs2046934) was predicted to be a protective factor for CR (CC+TC vs TT, OR: 0.407, 95% CI: 0.191-0.867, P=0.018). In addition, an association was found between hypertension and CR (P=0.022). CONCLUSION: The individuals with both the CYP2C19(*)2 allele and hypertension are at high risk of CR during anti-thrombosis therapy. The CYP3A4(*)1G allele, P2RY12 (rs2046934) C allele and NR1I2 (rs13059232) CC genotype may be protective factors for CR. The associated SNPs studied may be useful to predict clopidogrel resistance in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke.

26869472|t|Multicenter Prospective Trial of Stent Placement in Patients with Symptomatic High-Grade Intracranial Stenosis.
26869472|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On the basis of the high 1-month stroke and/or death (14.7%) rates associated with stent placement in the Stenting versus Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis trial, modifications in patient selection and procedural aspects for intracranial stent placement have been recommended. We performed a multicenter prospective single-arm trial to determine whether such modifications would result in lower rates of periprocedural stroke and/or death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study enrolled patients with recent transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke (excluding perforator ischemic events) related to high-grade (70%-99% in severity) stenosis of a major intracranial artery. Patients were treated by using angioplasty and self-expanding stents 3 weeks after the index ischemic event at 1 of the 10 high-volume centers in China. An independent neurologist ascertained the occurrence of any stroke and/or death within 1 month after the procedure. RESULTS: A total of 100 consecutive patients were recruited. The target lesions were located in the middle cerebral artery (M1) (n = 38, 38%), intracranial internal carotid artery (n = 17, 17%), intradural vertebral artery (n = 18, 18%), and basilar artery (n = 27, 27%). The technical success rate of stent deployment with residual stenosis of <50% was 100%. The overall 1-month stroke and/or death rate was 2% (95% confidence interval, 0.2%-7.0%). Two ischemic strokes occurred in the pontine region (perforator distribution) in patients following angioplasty and stent placement for basilar artery stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this prospective multicenter study demonstrated that modifications in patient selection and procedural aspects can substantially reduce the 1-month stroke and/or death rate following intracranial stent placement.

27107944|t|Danhong injection attenuates cardiac injury induced by ischemic and reperfused neuronal cells through regulating arginine vasopressin expression and secretion.
27107944|a|Ischemic stroke is associated with cardiac myocyte vulnerability through some unknown mechanisms. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) may exert considerable function in the relationship of brain damage and heart failure. Danhong injection (DHI) can protect both stroke and heart failure patients with good efficacy in clinics. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism of DHI in heart and brain co-protection effects to determine whether AVP plays key role in this course. In the present study, we found that both the supernatant from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and reperfused primary rat neuronal cells (PRNCs) and AVP treatment caused significant reduction in cell viability and mitochondrial activity in primary rat cardiac myocytes (RCMs). Besides, DHI had the same protective effects with conivaptan, a dual vasopressin V1A and V2 receptor antagonist, in reducing the RCM damage induced by overdose AVP. DHI significantly decreased the injury of both PRNCs and RCMs. Meanwhile, the AVP level was elevated dramatically in OGD and reperfusion PRNCs, and DHI was able to decrease the AVP expression in the injured PRNCs. Therefore, our present results suggested that OGD and reperfusion PRNCs might induce myocyte injury by elevating the AVP expression in PRNCs. The ability of DHI to reinstate AVP level may be one of the mechanisms of its brain and heart co-protection effects.

27165425|t|Intracranial Artery Calcification and Its Clinical Significance.
27165425|a|Intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is an easily identifiable entity on plain head computed tomography scans. Recent studies have found high prevalence rates for IAC worldwide, and this may be associated with ischemic stroke and cognitive decline. Aging, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and chronic kidney disease have been found to be associated with IAC. The severity of IAC can be assessed using different visual grading scales or various quantitative methods (by measuring volume or intensity). An objective method for assessing IAC using consistent criteria is urgently required to facilitate comparisons between multiple studies involving diverse populations. There is accumulating evidence from clinical studies that IAC could be utilized as an indicator of intracranial atherosclerosis. However, the pathophysiology underlying the potential correlation between IAC and ischemic stroke-through direct arterial stenosis or plaque stability-remains to be determined. More well-designed clinical studies are needed to explore the predictive values of IAC in vascular events and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

27108052|t|Combination of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Radix Paeoniae ameliorate focal cerebral ischemic in MCAO rats via endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent apoptotic signaling pathway.
27108052|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Combination of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Radix Paeoniae (XS) is highly effective in the treatment for focal cerebral ischemic, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. This study was conducted to evaluate the combinative effects of XS on MCAO rats and explore the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCAO rats were used to evaluate the protective effect of Ligusticum chuanxiong (CX), Radix Paeoniae Rubra (CS) and their combination (XS) on ameliorating focal cerebral ischemic. Cerebral ischemia deficits and infarct size were performed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining. Activities of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px, as well as levels of LPO and MDA were detected by commercial kits while ELISA kits for the content of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and plasminogen activator (PA). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analysis (WB) were carried out to examine the protein expressions including PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), cytoplasmic of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), X box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), and porcineB-cellleukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in brain tissues. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) were applied to examine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR1) mRNA levels. RESULTS: CX, CS and their combination (XS) could reduce cerebral ischemia deficits and infarct size of MCAO rats. They increased SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities, and reduced MDA and LPO levels in serum, markedly. A significant decrease of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related factors PERK, XBP-1, ATF-6 and CHOP protein expression levels while an increase of GRP78 and MVD expression by the treatment of CX, CS and XS. It could also be observed that their treatment could reduce apoptotic damage of brain tissues by up-regulating Bax level and down-regulating Bcl-2 level. Furthermore, the levels of MMP-9 and PAI-1 in serum and tissues of rats were down-regulated remarkably while TIMP-1 and PA levels were up-regulated. VEGF mRNA level was up-regulated dramatically whereas NMDAR1 was reduced. Importantly, the combination of CX and CS, namely XS, has a more meaningful improvement on focal cerebral ischemic than CX or CS alone. CONCLUSION: All these revealed that the combined XS exerted more remarkable protective effects than alone. XS could inhibit neuronal apoptosis by attenuating ER-stress-dependent apoptotic signaling and protected the blood-brain barrier. These findings might supply beneficial hints for the synergy of CX and CS, and provide the basis for rationality of XS preparation and deserve further clinical investigations.

27177163|t|Electroacupuncture ameliorates post-stroke learning and memory through minimizing ultrastructural brain damage and inhibiting the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injured rats.
27177163|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of electroacupuncture (EA) in the treatment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and to elucidate the association between this neuroprotective effect and brain ultrastructure and expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2 and 9. Rats underwent focal cerebral I/R injury by arterial ligation and received in vivo therapeutic EA at the Baihui (DU20) and Shenting (DU24) acupoints. The therapeutic efficacy was then evaluated following the surgery. The results of the current study demonstrated that EA treatment significantly ameliorated neurological deficits and reduced cerebral infarct volume compared with I/R injured rats. Furthermore, EA improved the learning and memory ability of rats following I/R injury, inhibited blood brain barrier breakdown and reduced neuronal damage in the ischemic penumbra. Furthermore, EA attenuated ultrastructural changes in the brain tissue following ischemia and inhibited MMP‑2/MMP‑9 expression in cerebral I/R injured rats. The results suggest that EA ameliorates anatomical deterioration, and learning and memory deficits in rats with cerebral I/R injury.

27174523|t|Black Hole Sign: Novel Imaging Marker That Predicts Hematoma Growth in Patients With Intracerebral Hemorrhage.
27174523|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early hematoma growth is a devastating neurological complication after intracerebral hemorrhage. We aim to report and evaluate the usefulness of computed tomography (CT) black hole sign in predicting hematoma growth in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS: Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were screened for the presence of CT black hole sign on admission head CT performed within 6 hours after onset of symptoms. The black hole sign was defined as hypoattenuatting area encapsulated within the hyperattenuating hematoma with a clearly defined border. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of CT black hole sign in predicting hematoma expansion were calculated. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the presence of the black hole sign and early hematoma growth. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients were enrolled. Black hole sign was found in 30 (14.6%) of 206 patients on the baseline CT scan. The black hole sign was more common in patients with hematoma growth (31.9%) than those without hematoma growth (5.8%; P<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of back hole sign in predicting early hematoma growth were 31.9%, 94.1%, 73.3%, and 73.2%, respectively. The time-to-admission CT scan, baseline hematoma volume, and the presence of black hole sign on admission CT independently predict hematoma growth in multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: The CT black hole sign could be used as a simple and easy-to-use predictor for early hematoma growth in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.

27090345|t|Characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine usage in patients with stroke in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study.
27090345|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Stroke has been the leading causes of death worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for stoke patients for thousands of years. This study aimed to investigate TCM usage and prescription patterns in stroke patients in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a random sample of one million individuals representing the 23 million enrollees selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Demographic characteristics, TCM usage, prescription patterns and mortality rate among stroke patients were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 23,816 patients who were newly diagnosed with stroke between 2001 and 2009 by their diagnostic codes (ICD-9-CM 430-438). Among them, 4302 patients had hemorrhagic stroke while 19,514 patients had ischemic stroke. Overall, 12% of the stroke patients (n=2862) were TCM users. The median interval between stroke onset to the first TCM consultation is 12.2 months. Among the TCM users, more than half (52.7%) of the patients received both Chinese herbal remedies and acupuncture/traumatology treatment. Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang and Dan-shen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae; Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) was the most commonly prescribed Chinese herbal formula and single herb, respectively. TCM users had a higher incidence rate ratio in myalgia, myositis, fasciitis and insomnia than non-TCM users. Mental disorders such as anxiety and depression are common in both TCM and non-TCM users. Comparing with the non-TCM users, the TCM users had a lower mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratios were 0.44 in overall stroke, 0.50 in ischemic stroke and 0.25 in hemorrhagic stroke). CONCLUSION: Adjunctive TCM use may reduce the risk of mortality rate among stroke patients. Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang and Dan-shen are the most common prescribed Chinese herbal formula and single herb for stroke patients, respectively. Future study investigating the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective efficacy of Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang and Dan-shen in stroke is warranted.

27063986|t|Wuling powder prevents the depression-like behavior in learned helplessness mice model through improving the TSPO mediated-mitophagy.
27063986|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Wuling powder (trade name: Wuling capsule), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), was extracted from mycelia of precious Xylaria Nigripes (Kl.) Sacc by modern fermentation technology, and has been claimed to be fully potent in improving the signs of insomnia and cognitive deficits. Moreover, Wuling capsule was effective in treating post-stroke and orther co-cormbid depression both in clinical and in basic research. In order to clarify the molecular mechanisms of the antidepressant effect of Wuling powder, we established learned helplessness (LH) depression animal model and focused on 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO) mediated-mitophagy pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were exposed to the inescapable e-shock (IS) once a day for three consecutive days to establish the LH model. Then mice were orally administered Wuling powder for 2 weeks. For the behavioral assessment, Shuttle box test, novelty suppressed feeding test (NSF) and forced swimming test (FST) were performed. Following the behavioral assessment, we assessed the protein expression level that were related to TSPO-mediated mitophagy signaling pathway by Western blotting analysis. Finally, immunohistochemistry method was used to assess the neuroprotective effects of Wuling powder. RESULTS: Compared with mice that were subjected to inescapable e-shock, Wuling powder exhibited antidepressant effect in the multiple behavioral tests. In addition, Wuling powder altered the expression level of multiple proteins related to TSPO-mediated mitophagy signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that Wuling powder exhibited an obvious antidepressant effect, which could be due to the improvement of TSPO-mediated mitophagy signaling pathway.

27041403|t|(1)H NMR-based metabonomics revealed protective effect of Naodesheng bioactive extract on ischemic stroke rats.
27041403|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the world. However, current therapies are limited. Naodesheng, a widely used traditional Chinese medicine prescription, has shown a good clinical curative effect on ischemic stroke. Also, Naodesheng has been suggested to have neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral ischemia rats, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of Naodesheng bioactive extract on the metabolic changes in brain tissue, plasma and urine induced by cerebral ischemia perfusion injury, and explore the possible metabolic mechanisms by using a (1)H NMR-based metabonomics approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model was established and confirmed by the experiments of neurobehavioral abnormality evaluation, brain tissue TTC staining and pathological examination. The metabolic changes in brain tissue, plasma and urine were then assessed by a (1)H NMR technique combined with multivariate statistical analysis method. RESULTS: These NMR data showed that cerebral ischemia reperfusion induced great metabolic disorders in brain tissue, plasma and urine metabolisms. However, Naodesheng bioactive extract could reverse most of the imbalanced metabolites. Meanwhile, it was found that both the medium and high dosages of Naodesheng bioactive extract were more effective on the metabolic changes than the low dosage, consistent with histopathological assessments. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that Naodesheng had protective effect on ischemic stroke rats and the underlying mechanisms involved multiple metabolic pathways, including energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammatory injury. The present study could provide evidence that metabonomics revealed its capacity to evaluate the holistic efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine and explore the underlying mechanisms.

27036628|t|Post-ischemic treatment of WIB801C, standardized Cordyceps extract, reduces cerebral ischemic injury via inhibition of inflammatory cell migration.
27036628|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Anti-inflammatory therapy has been intensively investigated as a potential strategy for treatment of cerebral stroke. However, despite many positive outcomes reported in animal studies, anti-inflammatory treatments have not proven successful in humans as yet. Although immunomodulatory activity and safety of Cordyceps species (Chinese caterpillar fungi) have been proven in clinical trials and traditional Asian prescriptions for inflammatory diseases, its anti-ischemic effect remains elusive. AIM OF THE STUDY: In the present study, therefore, we investigated the potential therapeutic efficacy of WIB801C, the standardized extract of Cordyceps militaris, for treatment of cerebral ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-chemotactic activity of WIB801C was assayed in cultured rat microglia/macrophages. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ischemic stroke via either transient (1.5-h tMCAO and subsequent 24-h reperfusion) or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO for 24-h without reperfusion). WIB801C was orally administered twice at 3- and 8-h (50mg/kg each) after the onset of MCAO. Infarct volume, edema, blood brain barrier and white matter damages, neurological deficits, and long-term survival rates were investigated. The infiltration of inflammatory cells into ischemic lesions was assayed by immunostaining. RESULTS: WIB801C significantly decreased migration of cultured microglia/macrophages. This anti-chemotactic activity of WIB-801C was not mediated via adenosine A3 receptors, although cordycepin, the major ingredient of WIB801C, is known as an adenosine receptor agonist. Post-ischemic treatment with WIB801C significantly reduced the infiltration of ED-1-and MPO-positive inflammatory cells into ischemic lesions in tMCAO rats. WIB801C-treated rats exhibited significantly decreased infarct volume and cerebral edema, less white matter and blood-brain barrier damages, and improved neurological deficits. WIB801C also improved survival rates over 34 days after ischemia onset. A significant reduction in infarct volume and neurobehavioral deficits by WIB801C was also observed in rats subjected to pMCAO. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, post-ischemic treatment of WIB801C reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells into ischemic lesions via inhibition of chemotaxis, which confers long-lasting histological and neurological protection in ischemic brain. WIB801C may be a promising anti-ischemic drug candidate with clinically relevant therapeutic time window and safety.

27277000|t|Anti-platelet activity of panaxatriol saponins is mediated by suppression of intracellular calcium mobilization and ERK2/p38 activation.
27277000|a|BACKGROUND: Increased platelet aggregation is implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and anti-platelet strategy may contribute to its therapy. Panaxatriol saponin (PTS), the main components extracted from Panax notoginseng, has been shown to be efficacious in the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke in China. The aim of this study is to determine the anti-platelet activity and explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Inhibitory effect of PTS and its main ginsenosides on agonists-induced platelet aggregation was determined using rabbit or human platelets. Intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) mobilization was detected with fura-2/AM probe. MAPKs phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: Our results showed PTS inhibited the rabbit platelet aggregation induced by various agonists (collagen, thrombin and ADP). The three main ginsenosides (Rg1, Re and R1) existing in PTS also showed anti-platelet activity, while their combination exhibited no synergistic effect on rabbit platelet aggregation. Further study demonstrated that PTS and its main ginsenosides also exhibited inhibitory effect on human platelet aggregation. Mechanism study demonstrated that pre-treatment with PTS inhibited the agonists-induced intracellular calcium mobilization. Moreover, PTS significantly suppressed the activation of both ERK2 and p38 by the agonists via reducing the phosphorylation of ERK2 and p38. CONCLUSION: We proved that PTS is effective in anti-platelet aggregation, which may, at least in part, be related to the suppression of intracellular calcium mobilization and ERK2/p38 activation. This study may provide one reasonable explanation for the efficacy of PTS on the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke.

27233782|t|Diabetes impairs spatial learning and memory and hippocampal neurogenesis via BDNF in rats with transient global ischemia.
27233782|a|Diabetic conditions worsen the prognosis of stroke. The molecular mechanism underlying the impairment of post-stroke recovery is not very clear. Here, we establish a rat model resembling human cerebral infarction with or without diabetes to determine how diabetes impairs cognitive recovery. Our data show that diabetes inhibits hippocampal BDNF expression and impairs the survival and differentiation of the newborn neural cells in rats with ischemia. Consequently, the rats of diabetic ischemia have a significantly lower score in spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze test than the non-diabetic ischemia model rats. On the other hand, treatment with BDNF effectively improves hippocampal neurogenesis and the spatial learning and memory in rat with diabetic ischemia. All together, our data suggest that diabetes impaired spatial learning and memory and hippocampal neurogenesis in rats with ischemia by inhibition of the BDNF expression in the hippocampus.

27094112|t|Pharmacokinetic study of isocorynoxeine metabolites mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes in rat and human liver microsomes.
27094112|a|Isocorynoxeine (ICN) is one of the major bioactive tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids found in Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Jacks. that is widely used for the treatment of hypertension, vascular dementia, and stroke. The present study was undertaken to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics of major ICN metabolites, and the role of simulated gastric and intestinal fluid (SGF and SIF), human and rat liver microsomes (HLMs and RLMs), and seven recombinant human CYP enzymes in the major metabolic pathway of ICN. A rapid, sensitive and accurate UHPLC/Q-TOF MS method was validated for the simultaneous determination of ICN and its seven metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of ICN at 40mg/kg. It was found that 18.19-dehydrocorynoxinic acid (DCA) and 5-oxoisocorynoxeinic acid (5-O-ICA) were both key and predominant metabolites, rather than ICN itself, due to the rapid and extensive metabolism of ICN in vivo. The further study indicated that ICN was mainly metabolized in human or rat liver, and CYPs 2C19, 3A4 and 2D6 were the major enzymes responsible for the biotransformation of ICN to DCA and 5-O-ICA in human. These findings are of significance in understanding of the pharmacokinetic nature of tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids, and provide helpful information for the clinical co-administration of the herbal preparations containing U. rhynchophylla with antihypertensive drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.

27059876|t|Screening and isolation of potential lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors from five Chinese medicinal herbs: Soybean, Radix pueraria, Flos pueraria, Rhizoma belamcandae, and Radix astragali.
27059876|a|Stroke is among the leading causes of death and severe disability worldwide. Flavonoids have been extensively used in the treatment of ischemic stroke by reducing lactate dehydrogenase levels and thereby enhancing blood perfusion to the ischemic region. Here, we used ultrafiltration high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and mass spectrometry for the rapid screening and identification of flavonoids from five Chinese medicinal herbs: soybean, Radix pueraria, Flos pueraria, Rhizoma belamcandae, and Radix astragali. Using PC12 cells as a suitable in vitro model of toxicity, cell viability was quantitated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The results showed that the extracts of soybean and the six major components, namely, acetyldaidzin, malonylgenistin, daidiain, glycitin, genistin, and acetylcitin; the extract of R. pueraria and its main component daidzein; the extract of F. pueraria and its three major components, tectorigenin, tectoridin, and tectorigenin-7-O-xylosylglucosid; and the extract of R. belamcandae and its main component, tectoridin, were strong lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors. Also, the components of R. astragali showed no bioactivity. These findings indicate that the ultrafltration high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and mass spectrometry method could be utilized in rapid screening and separation of bioactive compounds from a complex matrix.

27482225|t|Large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel involvement in suppression of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury after electroacupuncture at Shuigou (GV26) acupoint in rats.
27482225|a|Excess activation and expression of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BKCa channels) may be an important mechanism for delayed neuronal death after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Electroacupuncture can regulate BKCa channels after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, but the precise mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we established a rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Model rats received electroacupuncture of 1 mA and 2 Hz at Shuigou (GV26) for 10 minutes, once every 12 hours for a total of six times in 72 hours. We found that in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury rats, ischemic changes in the cerebral cortex were mitigated after electroacupuncture. Moreover, BKCa channel protein and mRNA expression were reduced in the cerebral cortex and neurological function noticeably improved. These changes did not occur after electroacupuncture at a non-acupoint (5 mm lateral to the left side of Shuigou). Thus, our findings indicate that electroacupuncture at Shuigou improves neurological function in rats following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and may be associated with down-regulation of BKCa channel protein and mRNA expression. Additionally, our results suggest that the Shuigou acupoint has functional specificity.

26970983|t|Quantitative analysis of highly similar salvianolic acids with 1H qNMR for quality control of traditional Chinese medicinal preparation Salvianolate Lyophilized Injection.
26970983|a|Salvianolate Lyophilized Injection (SLI), a traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) preparation which is used to treat stroke, is composed of multiple salvianolic acids from the aqueous extracts of Salvia miltiorrhiza, and includes mainly protocatechualdehyde, rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid B, salvianolic acid D, salvianolic acid E, diastereomer of salvianolic acid E, salvianolic acid Y, lithospermic acid and diastereomer of lithospermic acid. It is difficult to quantitatively control the quality of SLI using traditional high performance liquid chromatography due to the highly similar structure of these constituents including three pairs of diastereomers and the lack of commercial resources for most of these constituents as standards. Thus, a highly reproducible, fast, accurate and simple (1)H quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) method without the need for calibration curves and complex computation was established by optimizing the solvent system and acquisition parameters to simultaneously determine the nine salvianolic acids and mannitol in SLI. This method was validated and successfully used to determine 10 batches of SLI and the qNMR data were further analyzed with a vector including angle cosine and the partial least squares method for the quality control of SLI. The results indicated that qNMR can be used as a routine method for the quality control of SLI and may have potential in the quantification of diastereomers in other TCM preparations.

26969404|t|Decreased risk of stroke in patients receiving traditional Chinese medicine for vertigo: A population-based cohort study.
26969404|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Patients with vertigo are reported to exhibit a higher risk of subsequent stroke. However, it remains unclear if Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the most common form of complementary and alternative medicine, can help lower the risk of stroke for these patients. So the aim of the study was to investigate the effects of TCM on stroke risk among patients with vertigo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study used the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 112,458 newly diagnosed vertigo patients aged ≥20 years who received treatment between 1998 and 2007. Among these patients, 53,203 (47.31%) received TCM after vertigo onset (TCM users), and the remaining 59,201 patients were designated as a control group (non-TCM users). All enrollees received follow-up until the end of 2012 to measure stroke incidence. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) of stroke in recipients of TCM services. RESULTS: During 15-year follow-up, 5532 TCM users and 12,295 non-TCM users developed stroke, representing an incidence rate of 13.10% and 25.71% per 1000 person-years. TCM users had a significantly reduced risk of stroke compared to non-TCM users (adjusted HR=0.64; 95% confidence interval CI=0.59-0.74). The predominant effect was observed for those receiving TCM for more than 180 days (adjusted HR=0.52; 95% CI=0.49-0.56). Commonly used TCM formulae, including Ban-Xia-Bai-Zhu-Tian-Ma-Tang, Ling-Gui-Zhu-Gan-Tang, Bai Zhi (Angelica dahurica (Hoffm.) Benth. & Hook.f. ex Franch. & Sav., root), Ge Gen (Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, root) and Hai Piao Xiao (Endoconcha Sepiae, Cuttlefish Bone) were significantly associated with lower risk of stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this population-based study support the effects of TCM on reducing stroke risk, and may provide a reference for stroke prevention strategies. The study results may also help to integrate TCM into clinical intervention programs that provide a favorable prognosis for vertigo patients.

27174221|t|Comprehensive rehabilitation with integrative medicine for subacute stroke: A multicenter randomized controlled trial.
27174221|a|To determine whether integrative medicine rehabilitation (IMR) that combines conventional rehabilitation (CR) with acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine has better effects for subacute stroke than CR alone, we conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial that involved three hospitals in China. Three hundred sixty patients with subacute stroke were randomized into IMR and CR groups. The primary outcome was the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). The secondary outcomes were the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton's Depression Scale (HAMD), and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). All variables were evaluated at week 0 (baseline), week 4 (half-way of intervention), week 8 (after treatment) and week 20 (follow-up). In comparison with the CR group, the IMR group had significantly better improvements (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) in all the primary and secondary outcomes. There were also significantly better changes from baseline in theses outcomes in the IMR group than in the CR group (P < 0.01). A low incidence of adverse events with mild symptoms was observed in the IMR group. We conclude that conventional rehabilitation combined with integrative medicine is safe and more effective for subacute stroke rehabilitation.

27274246|t|The prevalence and risk factors of stroke in patients with chronic schizophrenia.
27274246|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the stroke risk and risk factors in patients with chronic schizophrenia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was a large-sample, cross-sectional survey. A total of 363 patients with chronic schizophrenia were selected from the Changping Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Beijing, in August 2014. The patients were divided into either stroke group or control group based on the presence of stroke. Clinical evaluation included positive and negative syndrome scale assessment and a detailed questionnaire to collect the general information and disease-related conditions. RESULTS: The prevalence of stroke was 16.5% (60 cases). Stroke and control groups showed a significant difference in age, sex, smoking, combined medication, doses, negative factor score in positive and negative syndrome scale, body mass index, waist circumference, and systolic blood pressure. Multivariate analysis showed that a number of factors are significantly related to stroke, including age, sex, smoking, combined medication, doses, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of stroke is relatively higher in Chinese patients with chronic schizophrenia. Chronic schizophrenia patients are more likely to suffer from stroke; meanwhile, a number of risk factors were identified, including old age, female sex, smoking history, combined medication with a variety of drugs, high doses, obesity, and high blood pressure.

27153119|t|Chinese Herbal Medicine for Aspirin Resistance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
27153119|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for the treatment of aspirin resistance (AR). METHODS: A comprehensive research of seven electronic databases was performed for comparative studies evaluating CHM for AR. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data wasere synthesized by using RevMan 5.3 software. (PROSPERO Registration #CRD42015020182). RESULTS: 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,460 patients were included. 15 RCTs reported significant difference in the reduction of platelet aggregation rate (PAR) induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (P<0.05), and 11 reported significant effect of CHM plus aspirin to reduce PAR induced by arachidonic acid (AA) (P<0.05) compared with aspirin 100mg/d treatment. The pooling data of 3 RCTs showed the thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in patients with CHM plus aspirin versus aspirin were significantly reduced (Random Effect model (RE), Standard Deviation (SD) = -95.93, 95% Confidential Interval (CI)[-118.25,-73.61], P<0.00001). Subgroup analysis showed that TXB2 (Fixed Effect model (FE), SD = -89.23, 95%CI[-121.96,-56.49], P<0.00001) had significant difference in Tongxinluo capsule plus aspirin versus aspirin. 2 RCTs reported the clinical effective rate, and the meta-analysis result showed a significant difference in intervention and control group (FE, Relative Risk (RR) = 1.67, 95%CI[1.15, 2.42], P = 0.007<0.05). In 4 trials, CHM plus aspirin had better effects of reducing the reoccurrence of cerebral infarction than aspirin (FE, RR = 0.24, 95%CI [0.11, 0.49], P<0.0001). And one trial showed that CHM plus aspirin could decrease the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NHISS) score (P<0.05) and increase the Barthel Index (BI) score (P<0.05). 4 trials stated that there were no adverse effects occurred in intervention group, and analysis showed significant difference of CHM or CHM plus aspirin in reducing the occurrence of adverse events (FE, RR = 0.22, 95%CI[0.13, 0.39], P<0.00001). 5 trials claimed that the CHM monotherapy and CHM adjunctive therapy for AR did not add the risk of bleeding (FE, RR = 0.50, 95%CI[0.20, 1.22], P = 0.13>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CHM may be effective and safe as an alternative and collaborative therapy for AR. However, the current evidence and potential promising findings should be interpreted with caution due to poor and varying methodological quality of included studies and the heterogeneity of interventions. Thus, further exploration of this strategy with adequately powered RCTs is warranted.

27123252|t|Interaction between muscle and bone, and improving the effects of electrical muscle stimulation on amyotrophy and bone loss in a denervation rat model via sciatic neurectomy.
27123252|a|The side-to-side difference in bone mineral content and soft tissue composition of extremities and their associations have been observed in patients with stroke and the results are inconsistent. The aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction between bone mineral content (BMC), lean mass (LM) and fat mass (FM) in the paretic extremities in patients following stroke and to determine the effectiveness of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) following sciatic neurectomy (SN) in rats. BMC, LM and FM were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 61 hemiplegic patients following stroke. In the rat model study, groups of 10 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into EMS and non-EMS subgroups. Myostatin expression and tetracycline interlabel width were measured. There were significant decreases in BMC, LM and FM in paretic limbs compared to non-paretic limbs. Compared to non-EMS, downregulated myostatin mRNA, and upregulated mechano growth factor (MGF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mRNA expression levels were observed in the EMS subgroup (P<0.05). In conclusion, muscle may have an important role in maintaining BMC. EMS-induced muscle contraction effectively downregulated myostatin mRNA, upregulated MGF and IGF-1 mRNA expression in muscle fiber, and mitigated amyotrophy and cortical bone loss from SN.

27338955|t|Activating blood circulation to remove stasis treatment of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage: A multi-center prospective randomized open-label blinded-endpoint trial.
27338955|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of the Chinese herbal therapeutic regimen of activating blood circulation (TRABC) in treatment of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH). METHODS: This was a multi-center prospective randomized open-label blinded-endpoint (PROBE) trial with HICH admitted to 12 hospitals. Totally 240 participants were randomized to the treatment group treated with TRABC in addition to conventional Western treatment or the control group with conventional Western treatment equally for 3 months. Primary outcome was degree of disability as measured by modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary outcomes were the absorption of hematoma and edema, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and patient-reported outcome measures for stroke and Barthel activities of daily living index. Adverse events and mortality were also recorded. RESULTS: After 3 months of treatment, the rate of mRS 0-1 and mRS 0-2 in the treatment group was 72.5% and 80.4%, respectively, and in the control group 48.1% and 63.9%, respectively, with a significant difference between groups (P<0.01). Hematoma volume decreased significantly at day 7 of treatment in the treatment group than the control group (P=0.038). Average Barthel scores in the treatment group after treatment was 89.11±19.93, and in the control group 82.18±24.02 (P=0.003). NIHSS scores of the two groups after treatment decreased significantly compared with before treatment (P=0.001). Patient-reported outcomes in the treatment group were lower than the control group at day 21 and 3 months of treatment (P<0.05). There were 4 deaths, 2 in each group, and 11 adverse events, 6 in the treatment group and 5 in the control group. CONCLUSION: The integrative therapy combined TRABC with conventional Western treatment for HICH could promote hematoma absorption thus minimize neurologic impairment, without increasing intracerebral hematoma expansion and re-bleeding.

27111620|t|Survey and Risk Factors for Lower Urinary Tract Storage Symptoms in Middle-Aged and Older Stroke Patients in Urban China.
27111620|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence and associated risk factors of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in people with stroke. This was the first study that systematically surveyed the risk factors for LUTS in people with various lengths of stroke history in urban Chinese communities. METHODS: A community-based, cross-sectional study was performed on 1404 residents aged over 40 years, randomly selected in the urban area of Zhengzhou, China. A questionnaire including the subjects' general health information, sociodemographic background, medical history, and the overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) was filled by the subjects on site. RESULTS: Data from 706 (63.8.9 ± 8.9 years old) stroke subjects and 698 non-stroke subjects were analyzed. The prevalence of LUTS in stroke subjects was 62.6%, significantly higher than non-stroke subjects. The prevalence in men was higher than women (P < 0.01). The stroke subjects with diabetes mellitus had higher odds for LUTS than those without diabetes (P < 0.05). The prevalence of LUTS was also significantly correlated with increasing age, high educational level, living alone, snoring, hypertension and coronary heart diseases (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified not only putative risk factors for LUTS in middle-aged and elderly stroke patients, but genuine factors including snoring, living environment and educational background that increased the odds of storage symptoms as well. We identified that regular exercise and living with their children were protective factors for storage symptoms in stroke patients.

26133301|t|Thrombomodulin and High-Sensitive C-Reactive Protein Levels in Blood Correlate with the Development of Cerebral Infarction Among Asians.
26133301|a|Our meta-analysis was designed to obtain the correlation between thrombomodulin (TM) and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and the development of cerebral infarction (CI). Case-control studies relevant to the role plasma TM levels and serum hs-CRP levels in the development of CI were retrieved both electronically and manually and further screened according to a predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All enrolled studies were analyzed for meta-regression analyses, sensitivity analyses, and assessments of publication bias. Comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.0 software (CMA 2.0) was used for statistical analysis. A total of 359 studies were initially retrieved, and 13 studies were eventually recruited into our meta-analysis with a total of 881 CI patients (plasma TM levels: n = 513; serum hs-CRP levels: n = 368) and 1067 healthy controls. The results of our meta-analysis suggested that plasma TM levels and serum hs-CRP levels in CI patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. In conclusion, increased plasma TM levels and serum hs-CRP levels in CI patients were associated with the development of CI in Asians.

27335559|t|Immediate effects of scalp acupuncture with twirling reinforcing manipulation on hemiplegia following acute ischemic stroke: a hidden association study.
27335559|a|Data mining has the potential to provide information for improving clinical acupuncture strategies by uncovering hidden rules between acupuncture manipulation and therapeutic effects in a data set. In this study, we performed acupuncture on 30 patients with hemiplegia due to acute ischemic stroke. All participants were pre-screened to ensure that they exhibited immediate responses to acupuncture. We used a twirling reinforcing acupuncture manipulation at the specific lines between the bilateral Baihui (GV20) and Taiyang (EX-HN5). We collected neurologic deficit score, simplified Fugl-Meyer assessment score, muscle strength of the proximal and distal hemiplegic limbs, ratio of the maximal H-reflex to the maximal M-wave (Hmax/Mmax), muscle tension at baseline and immediately after treatment, and the syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine at baseline. We then conducted data mining using an association algorithm and an artificial neural network backpropagation algorithm. We found that the twirling reinforcing manipulation had no obvious therapeutic difference in traditional Chinese medicine syndromes of "Deficiency and Excess". The change in the muscle strength of the upper distal and lower proximal limbs was one of the main factors affecting the immediate change in Fugl-Meyer scores. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the muscle tension change of the upper limb and Hmax/Mmax immediate change, and both positive and negative correlations existed between the muscle tension change of the lower limb and immediate Hmax/Mmax change. Additionally, when the difference value of muscle tension for the upper and lower limbs was > 0 or < 0, the difference value of Hmax/Mmax was correspondingly positive or negative, indicating the scalp acupuncture has a bidirectional effect on muscle tension in hemiplegic limbs. Therefore, acupuncture with twirling reinforcing manipulation has distinct effects on acute ischemic stroke patients with different symptoms or stages of disease. Improved muscle tension in the upper and lower limbs, reflected by the variation in the Hmax/Mmax ratio, is crucial for recovery of motor function from hemiplegia.

28895342|a|To study the effect and possible molecular mechanisms of Terminalia chebula extract HZ4 on focal cerebral infarction in rats, 90 healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into sham-operation group, model group, T. chebula extract HZ4 high dose, middle dose and low dose groups (80, 40, 20 mg•kg ⁻¹•d ⁻¹, ig) and positive control group (Panax notoginseng saponins, PNS 30 mg•kg ⁻¹•d ⁻¹, ig). The focal cerebral infarction models were established by photochemical method. After the rats were administered for 7 consecutive days, neurogenic behavior rating of these rats was done by balance beam test and foot fault test. The cells morphological changes of penumbra in focal cerebral infarction were investigated by HE staining method; the infarct volume was detected by TTC staining. The expression levels of β-catenin and cyclin D1, the key node genes in Wnt signaling pathway of the focal penumbra tissues were detected via RT-PCR. The results showed that, as compared with the model group, behavioural indicators were improved significantly in the rats of administration groups, and the infarct volume and pathological changes of penumbra tissues were also improved at the same time. Compared with the model group, the expression levels of β-catenin and cyclin D1 in Wnt signaling pathway were significantly up-regulated in administration groups(P<0.01). This study first confirmed that T. chebula extract HZ4 can decrease infarct volume, improve the sport ability score, and promote rehabilitation of model animals. In addition, it could significant up-regulated the expression levels of β-catenin and cyclin D1, and the mechanism may be associated with Wnt signaling pathway. The study is innovative to a certain extent.

27188350|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of fall in the old farmers of Miyun county in Beijing. METHODS: The old farmers who lived in Jugezhuang and Fengjiayu townships of Miyun county were selected for a questionnaire survey to collect the information about the incidence of fall and their health status. RESULTS: A total of 2 397 old farmers, including 967 males and 1 430 females, were surveyed. Fall occurred in 347 old farmers(14.5%). The difference in the incidence of fall was significant between males(9.6%)and females(17.8%). A total of 282 falls occurred in courtyards, 45 falls occurred in field/hilly areas. Among the falls occurred, 216(27.2%)led to injuries. The most common site of injuries was hip(45 falls). Logistic regression analysis showed that physical exercise and high income were protective factors, but difficult standing up and walking, visual problem and stroke were the risk factors. In the males, the special risk factor was mid cognitive impairment, and in the females, the special risk factor was urinary incontinence, but afternoon nap was a protective factor. CONCLUSION: The incidence of fall in the rural community was relatively high with distinct area distribution, which has caused serious influence on the mental and physical health of the elderly.

26902830|t|Protective effect of Naoxintong against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury in mice.
26902830|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Naoxintong (NXT), a renowned traditional Chinese medicine in China, has been used for the treatment of acute and chronic cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in clinic for more than 20 years. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the potential neuroprotective effect of NXT against ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice and investigate the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Focal cerebral I/R injury in adult male CD-1 mice was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 1h followed by reperfusion for 23h. Mice were randomly divided into five groups: Sham group; tMCAO group; Vehicle group; NXT-treated groups at doses of 0.36g/kg and 0.54g/kg. The effects of NXT on murine neurological function were estimated by neurological defect scores, infarct volume and brain water content at 24h after tMCAO. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expression of LOX-1, pERK1/2 and NF-κB at 24h after tMCAO. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of LOX-1 and NF-κB at 24h after tMCAO. RESULTS: Compared with Vehicle group, 0.54g/kg group of NXT significantly ameliorated neurological outcome, infarction volume and brain water content, decreased the expression of LOX-1, pERK1/2 and NF-κB (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: NXT protected the mice brain against I/R injury, and this protection maybe associated with the down-regulation of LOX-1, pERK1/2 and NF-κB expression.

26852160|a|The Xiao-Xu-Ming decoction (XXMD) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that is clinically used for the treatment of stroke. The active fraction of XXMD (AF-XXMD) exhibits pharmacological effects that are similar to those of XXMD. In this study, 21 primary compounds of AF-XXMD with potential anti-ischemic-stroke activities were selected as effective candidates to perform comparisons of their pharmacokinetic differences between control and cerebral ischemic rats and to characterize their pharmacokinetic behaviors in cerebral ischemic rats. After oral administration of AF-XXMD to control and cerebral ischemic rats, plasma and brain were harvested and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Reverse molecular docking results indicate that 21 AF-XXMD-derived compounds exert potential neuroprotection, anti- inflammation, and vascular dilation effects via interaction with multiple targets in stroke-related pathways. The blood-brain permeability, cerebral exposure and brain region distribution of these compounds were found to change in cerebral ischemic models. Flavonoids were identified as the predominant form in plasma, whereas chromones were found to be the major form in the brain, and alkaloids possessed moderate blood-brain permeability. Collectively, the cerebral pharmacokinetic behaviors of chromones, flavonoids and alkaloids were found to change under pathological conditions. The efficacy of AF-XXMD against cerebral ischemia is relevant to the synergistic effects of these compounds in targeting different receptors and pathways. Chromones exhibit relatively high brain permeability, and their activity and mechanism warrant further investigation.

26979777|t|Electroacupunctre improves motor impairment via inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in the sensorimotor cortex after ischemic stroke.
26979777|a|AIMS: Electroacupuncture (EA) is one of the safety and effective therapies for improving neurological and sensorimotor impairment via blockade of inappropriate inflammatory responses. However, the mechanisms of anti-inflammation involved is far from been fully elucidated. MAIN METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemic stroke was administered by the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) surgery. The MCAO/R rats were accepted EA treatment at the LI 11 and ST 36 acupoints for consecutive 3days. The neurological outcome, animal behaviors test and molecular biology assays were used to evaluate the MCAO/R model and therapeutic effect of EA. KEY FINDINGS: EA treatment for MCAO rats showed a significant reduction in the infarct volumes accompanied by functional recovery in mNSS outcomes, motor function performances. The possible mechanisms that EA treatment attenuated the over-activation of Iba-1 and ED1 positive microglia in the peri-infract sensorimotor cortex. Simultaneously, both tissue and serum protein levels of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were decreased by EA treatment in MCAO/R injured rats. The levels of inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) were decreased in the peri-infract sensorimotor cortex and blood serum of MCAO/R injured rats after EA treatment. Furthermore, we found that EA treatment prevented from the nucleus translocation of NF-κB p65 and suppressed the expression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in the peri-infract sensorimotor cortex. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings from this study indicated that EA improved the motor impairment via inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation that invoked NF-κB p65, p38 MAPK and MyD88 produced proinflammatory cytokine in the peri-infract sensorimotor cortex of rats following ischemic stroke.

27074031|t|Decreased Functional Connectivity of Homotopic Brain Regions in Chronic Stroke Patients: A Resting State fMRI Study.
27074031|a|The recovery of motor functions is accompanied by brain reorganization, and identifying the inter-hemispheric interaction post stroke will conduce to more targeted treatments. However, the alterations of bi-hemispheric coordination pattern between homologous areas in the whole brain for chronic stroke patients were still unclear. The present study focuses on the functional connectivity (FC) of mirror regions of the whole brain to investigate the inter-hemispheric interaction using a new fMRI method named voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Thirty left subcortical chronic stroke patients with pure motor deficits and 37 well-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state fMRI scans. We employed a VMHC analysis to determine the brain areas showed significant differences between groups in FC between homologous regions, and we explored the relationships between the mean VMHC of each survived area and clinical tests within patient group using Pearson correlation. In addition, the brain areas showed significant correlations between the mean VMHC and clinical tests were defined as the seed regions for whole brain FC analysis. Relative to HCs, patients group displayed lower VMHC in the precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, calcarine gyrus, thalamus, cerebellum anterior lobe, and cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL). Moreover, the VMHC of CPL was positively correlated with the Fugl-Meyer Score of hand (FMA-H), while a negative correlation between illness duration and the VMHC of this region was also detected. Furthermore, we found that when compared with HCs, the right CPL exhibited reduced FC with the left precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, middle temporal gyrus, thalamus and hippocampus. Our results suggest that the functional coordination across hemispheres is impaired in chronic stroke patients, and increased VMHC of the CPL is significantly associated with higher FMA-H scores. These findings may be helpful in understanding the mechanism of hand deficit after stroke, and the CPL may serve as a target region for hand rehabilitation following stroke.

26805468|t|Tongxinluo reduces brain edema and inhibits post-ischemic inflammation after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.
26805468|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tongxinluo (TXL), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine, has been proved multiple therapeutic effects in cerebral ischemic infraction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of TXL on the brain edema and post-ischemic inflammatory response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat was used as the ischemia model. Rats were treated with TXL. In the first stage, the best dosage was chosen based on functional assessment and infarct size. In the second stage, rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham control (sham), ischemia and reperfusion (IR) 24h, TXL24h, I/R72h, TXL72h. TXL(1.6g/kg/day) administration was pre-performed for 3 days in TXL groups, and was post-performed for 24h (TXL24h group) or 72h (TXL72h group). Brain edema was measured by water content, MRI and AQP4 expression. Iba1, HMGB1, TLR4, NF-κB expression were examined by immunofluorescence staining or Western blot. TNF-α was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: High dose (1.6g/kg/day) of TXL remarkably reduced neurological deficit scores and cerebral infarct area. Compared with those results of I/R24h group, pre-post treatment with TXL for 3 days decreased brain water content, down-regulated AQP4 expression, lowered relative signal intensity of T2WI, reduced lesion volume ratio, and inhibited the activation of microglia, HMGB1, TLR4, NF-κB and TNF-α. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that the TXL pre-post treatment for 3 days could be an effective therapy for brain ischemia by inhibiting the development of brain edema and post-ischemic inflammation.

26805466|t|PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to neuroprotective effect of Tongxinluo against focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats.
26805466|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tongxinluo (TXL), a compound prescription, is formulated according to the collateral disease doctrine of traditional Chinese medicine, and is widely used for the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in China. AIM OF THE STUDY: We aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of TXL on focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats by attenuating its brain damage and neuronal apoptosis, and to assess the potential role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway in this protection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=120) were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham, cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), cerebral ischemia and reperfusion plus TXL (1.6g/kg/day) (TXL1.6), TXL1.6 plus LY294002 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (TXL1.6+LY294002), TXL1.6 plus DMSO (TXL1.6+vehicle). Prior to the grouping, TXL1.6 was selected to be the optimal dose of TXL by evaluating the neurological deficits score of five group rats (Sham, I/R, TXL0.4, TXL0.8 and TXL1.6, n=30) at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after reperfusion. Rats, being subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90min followed by 24h reperfusion, were the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion models. At 24h after reperfusion, cerebral infarct area was measured via tetrazolium staining and neuronal damage was showed by Nissl staining. The double staining of Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and immunofluorescence labeling with NeuN, was performed to evaluate neuronal apoptosis. Proteins involved in PI3K/Akt pathway were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The results showed that TXL markedly improved neurological function, reduced cerebral infarct area, decreased neuronal damage, and significantly attenuated neuronal apoptosis, while these effects were eliminated by inhibition of PI3K/Akt with LY294002. We also found that TXL up-regulated the expression levels of p-PDK1, p-Akt, p-c-Raf, p-BAD and down-regulated Cleaved caspase 3 expression notably, which were partially reversed by LY294002. Additionally, the increment of p-PTEN level on which LY294002 had little effect was also detected in response to TXL treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated that TXL provided neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and neuronal apoptosis, and this effect was mediated partly by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

27062945|t|Reduced risk of stroke in patients with cardiac arrhythmia receiving traditional Chinese medicine: A nationwide matched retrospective cohort study.
27062945|a|OBJECTIVE: Patients with cardiac arrhythmia were more likely to develop stroke than general population. The therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on the risk of stroke in patients with cardiac arrhythmia was unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk of stroke in patients with cardiac arrhythmia receiving TCM. METHODS: From the one million cohort of the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified cohort of cardiac arrhythmia included 2029 patients who received TCM treatment in 2000-2004. The matching methods with propensity score was used to select 2029 appropriate control cohort for comparison. Incident events of stroke were identified during the follow-up period at the end of 2010. Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of stroke associated with TCM treatment. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, patients with cardiac arrhythmia who underwent TCM treatment (11.4 per 1000 person-years) had a lower incidence of new-onset stroke than those without TCM treatment (17.7 per 1000 person-years), with an HR of 0.62 (95% CI=0.50-0.78). The association between TCM treatment and decreased new-onset stroke was both significant in women and men. The young patients aged 45-54 years who received TCM had the lowest risk of stroke (HR=0.48, 95% CI=0.27-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Receiving TCM treatment was associated with a lower risk of stroke in patients with cardiac arrhythmia. However, this study was limited by lack of information regarding lifestyles, biochemical profiles, the dose of herbal medicine, and acupuncture points used in treatments.

27190440|t|Which is better in the rehabilitation of stroke patients, core stability exercises or conventional exercises?
27190440|a|[Purpose] The aim of this study was to determine which is better in the rehabilitation of stroke patients, core stability exercises or conventional exercises. [Subjects and Methods] Forty participants with hemiplegia were recruited in the Department of Neurology of Yidu Central Hospital of Weifang between January 2014 and February 2015 and randomly divided into either an experimental or control group. The patients in the control group performed conventional exercises for six weeks, and those in the experiment group performed core stability exercises for six weeks. The outcomes were evaluated using Modified Barthel Index and Berg Balance Scale. [Results] After treatment, the Modified Barthel Index and Berg Balance Scale were significantly increased in both groups when compared with the baseline. The Modified Barthel Index was significantly lower in the control group compared with the experimental group. The Berg Balance Scale scores in the control group were relatively lower than those in the experimental group, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. [Conclusion] Core stability exercises have a better effect on patients with hemiplegia than conventional exercises.

26830317|t|Serum Calcium and Phosphate Levels and Short- and Long-Term Outcomes in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage Patients.
26830317|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated whether admission serum calcium and phosphate levels are associated with short- and long-term outcomes in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS: A total of 365 patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage were enrolled in this study. Participants were classified into 4 subgroups according to serum calcium or phosphate quartiles. Demographic characteristics, lifestyle risk factors, medical history, and other clinical characteristics were recorded for all the participants. Excellent outcome was defined as discharge or 3-month modified Rankin scale scores of 0-1. RESULTS: Univariate analysis comparing the highest and lowest quartiles indicated that an elevated calcium level was associated with 2.26- and 2.28-fold increases in the odds for discharge and 3-month excellent outcome, respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, and other potential risk factors, patients in the highest quartile still had significantly increased odds of discharge and 3-month excellent outcome; the corresponding odds ratios (ORs) were 3.43 (95% confidence interval [[CI], 1.03-11.44) and 5.36 (95% CI, 1.69-16.98). When calcium was divided into two groups, the ORs of higher calcium were 2.9 (95% CI, 1.1-7.62) and 2.8 (95% CI, 1.15-6.82) for discharge and 3-month excellent outcome, respectively. However, no significant association was observed between serum phosphate and excellent outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated admission serum calcium level but not phosphate level is positively associated with excellent outcome at discharge or 3 months in acute intracerebral hemorrhage patients.

26936330|t|Neuroprotective effects of Ilexonin A following transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
26936330|a|Ilexonin A is a compound isolated from the root of a plant commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible protective mechanism of Ilexonin A in rats subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 2 h of MCAO, followed by reperfusion. Ilexonin A at doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg were administered via intraperitoneal injection immediately following ischemia/reperfusion. The expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium‑binding adapter molecule‑1 (Iba‑1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fetal liver kinase‑1 (Flk‑1) and Nestin were examined using immunostaining and Western blot analysis of the peri‑infarct region following ischemia/reperfusion. Ilexonin A significantly decreased the infarct volume and improved neurological deficits in a dose‑dependent manner. The expression levels of VEGF, Flk‑1 and Nestin were significantly increased in the rats treated with Ilexonin A, compared with the rats administered with saline. Following treatment with Ilexonin A, a higher number of GFAP‑positive astrocytes were found in the Ilexonin A‑treated rats at 1, 3 and 7 days, compared with the rats exposed to ischemia only, however, there were fewer astrocytes at 14 days, compared with the ischemia group. Ilexonin A significantly decreased the protein expression of Iba‑1. The results of the present study suggested that the protective effects of Ilexonin A were associated with revascularization, neuronal regeneration, and the regulation of astrocyte and microglia cell activation.

26564149|t|Difference of language cortex reorganization between cerebral arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations, and gliomas: a functional MRI study.
26564149|a|The authors attempted to demonstrate the difference in language cortex reorganization between cerebral malformations (AVMs), cavernous malformations (CMs), and gliomas by blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical and imaging data of 27 AVM patients (AVM-L group), 29 CM patients (CM-L group), and 20 glioma patients (Glioma-L group) were retrospectively reviewed, with lesions overlying the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca area). As a control, patients with lesions involving the right inferior frontal gyrus were also enrolled, including 14 AVM patients (AVM-R group), 20 CM patients (CM-R group), and 14 glioma patients (Glioma-R group). All patients were right-handed. Lateralization indices (LI) of BOLD signal activations were calculated separately for Broca and Wernicke areas. In AVM-L group, right-sided lateralization of BOLD signals was observed in 10 patients (37.0%), including 6 in the Broca area alone, 1 in the Wernicke area alone, and 3 in both areas. Three patients (10.3%) of CM-L group showed right-sided lateralization in both Broca and Wernicke areas, and 1 patient (5.0%) of Glioma-L group had right-sided lateralization in the Wernicke area alone. A significant difference of right-sided lateralization was observed between the AVM-L group and CM-L group (P = 0.018) and also between the AVM-L group and Glioma-L group (P = 0.027). No patient in AVM-R, CM-R, or Glioma-R groups showed right-sided lateralization. Language cortex reorganization may occur in AVM, CM, and glioma patients when the traditional language cortex was involved by lesions, but the potential of reorganization for CM and glioma patients seems to be insufficient compared with AVM patients.

26696600|t|Cloning, prokaryotic expression and functional analysis of squalene synthase (SQS) in Magnolia officinalis.
26696600|a|Magnolia officinalis Rehder et Wilson is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that is used to treat various diseases such as neurosis, anxiety, and stroke. The main secondary metabolites in magnolia bark are phenolic compounds and terpenoids. Squalene synthase plays a significant role in catalyzing two farnesyl diphosphate molecules to form squalene, the first precursor of triterpenoid, phytosterol, and cholesterol biosynthesis. In this study, a full-length cDNA of squalene synthase was cloned from M. officinalis and designated MoSQS (GenBank accession no. KT223496). The gene contains a 1240-bp open reading frame and it encodes a protein with 409 amino acids. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis clearly suggested that MoSQS shared high similarity with squalene synthases among other plants. Prokaryotic expression showed that a transmembrane domain-deleted (385-409 aa) MoSQS mutant (MoSQSΔTM) could be expressed in its soluble form in Escherichia coli Transetta (DE3). GC-MS analysis showed that squalene was detected in an in vitro reaction mixture. These results indicated that MoSQSΔTM was functional, thereby establishing an important foundation for the study of triterpenoid biosynthesis in M. officinalis.

27352486|t|[Acupuncture combined with western medication for mild cognitive disorder after stroke: a rando- mized controlled trial].
27352486|a|OBJECTIVE: To verify the clinical effect of the penetration acupuncture at the acupoints of governor vessel(GV) and bladder meridian on head for mild cognitive disorder after stroke. METHODS: One hundred and ten patients were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 55 cases in each one. Penetration acupuncture was used at the acupoints of GV and bladder meridian on head in the observation group,namely Wuchu (BL 5) to Chengguang (BL 6) and Tongtian (BL 7) to Luoque (BL 8) bilaterally, and Shenting (GV 24) to Xinhui (GV 22), Qianding (GV 21) to Baihui (GV 20), Houding (GV 19) to Qiangjian (GV 18). Body acupuncture and conventional western medication were applied in the both two groups. Acupuncture was adopted once a day, five times a week and eight weeks totally. The changes of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini mental state examination scale(MMSE), self-rating depressive scale (SDS) and activities of daily living scale (Barthel index) were compared between the two groups before treatment, in the middle of treatment(at the forth week) after treatment(at the eighth week) and in three weeks after treatment(follow-up). RESULTS: After treatment of four and eight weeks and at the time of follow-up, the results of MoCA, MMSE, SDS and Barthel index were apparently im proved compared with those before treatment in the two groups (all P < 0.01). After treatment of eight weeks and at the time of follow-up, the scores of MoCA and SDS were obviously improved in the observation group compared with those in the control group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The improvements of MMSE in the observation group were more marked than those in the control group at all times (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). But there was no statistical significance about the change of Barthel index between the two groups (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Penetration acupuncture at the acupoints of GV and bladder meridian on head can remarkablely improve the cognitive function of the patients with mild cognitive disorder after stroke,and have some efficacy of relieving the bad mood such as depression.

27323607|t|[Effect of Comprehensive Protocol of Integrative Medicine on Motor Function, Activity of Daily Living and Quality of Life in Hemiplegia Patients after Stroke].
27323607|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of integrative medicine (IM) rehabilitation protocolon motor function, activity of daily living, and quality of life (QOL) in hemiplegia patients after stroke. METHODS: Totally 120 patients with post-stroke hemiplegia were allocated to four groups using sealed envalope drawing, i.e., the rehabilitation group, the Chinese medical treatment group, the acupuncture group, and the comprehensive rehabilitation group, 30 cases in each group. Based on routine rehabilitative training, patients in the Chinese medical treatment group, the acupuncture group, and the compre-hensive rehabilitation group received standardized treatment based on syndrome typing, Shi's Consciousness-Restoring Resuscitation acupuncture, Chinese herbs + acupuncture comprehensive rehabilitatino protocol, respectively. The treatmet cycle consisted of 4 weeks with 24-week follow-ups. Fugl-Meyer motor assessment (FMA), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale(SS-QQL), and safety assessment were taken as main effect indices before treatment, at week 4 of treatment, at week 12 and 24 of follow-ups, respectively. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in FMA score, MBI score, SS-QOL score among the four groups before treatment (P > 0.05). These scores were significantly improved in the four groups at week 4 of treatment, week 12 and 24 of follow-ups, respectively (P < 0.05). Besides, FMA score and SS-QOL score were significantly improved in the comprehensive rehabilitation group at each corresponding time point, as compared with other treatment groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive protocol could significantly improve motor function, activity of daily living in hemiplegia patients after stroke, and further improve their QOL. Its effect was better than other single treatment.

26974541|t|Oridonin Attenuates Synaptic Loss and Cognitive Deficits in an Aβ1-42-Induced Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
26974541|a|Synaptic loss induced by beta-amyloid (Aβ) plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. In this study, we found that oridonin (Ori) rescued synaptic loss induced by Aβ1-42 in vivo and in vitro and attenuated the alterations in dendritic structure and spine density observed in the hippocampus of AD mice. In addition, Ori increased the expression of PSD-95 and synaptophysin and promoted mitochondrial activity in the synaptosomes of AD mice. Ori also activated the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus of AD mice. Furthermore, in the Morris water maze test, Ori reduced latency and searching distance and increased the number of platform crosses in AD mice. These data suggest that Ori might prevent synaptic loss and improve behavioral symptoms in Aβ1-42-induced AD mice.

26956463|t|Risk factors and clinical features in ischemic stroke patients with different tongue conditions.
26956463|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors and clinical features in ischemic stroke patients with different tongue conditions. METHODS: A total of 168 successive acute ischemic stroke inpatients (within 7 days of stroke onset) were recruited. Patients were assigned to groups according to tongue color (pink, pale, red, purple), tongue coating (no coating, thin coating, thick coating) and sublingual vessel (normal, abnormal). Risk factors and clinical features including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI), clinical classification, laboratory data and pulmonary infection complications were compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in risk factors and clinical features among groups with different tongue colors. The incidence of smoking (4.5%) was lower in the no coating group compared with the thin (30.0%) and thick (39.3%) coating groups (P<0.017). NIHSS (19.05±10.68) in the no coating group was higher than the thin (6.40±6.18) and thick (7.41±7.05) coating groups (P<0.017), BI (20.91±29.99) was lower than the thin (67.61±28.78) and thick (63.02±33.54) coating groups (P<0.017), and the percentage of mRS >3 (90.9%) was higher than the thin (42.2%) and thick (42.9%) coating groups (P<0.017). The percentage of partial anterior circulation infarction patients in the no coating group was higher than the thin coating group (77.3% vs. 42.2%), and the percentage of lacunar infarction patients was lower than the thin coating group (4.5% vs. 37.8%, P<0.017). NIHSS in the abnormal sublingual vessel group was lower than the normal group (5.28±4.38 vs. 10.57±9.58, P=0.000), and BI was higher than the normal group (67.61±29.29 vs. 54.64±36.23, P=0.015). CONCLUSION: Tongue conditions of acute stroke patients were relevant to clinical features.

26950337|t|The A2DS2 Score as a Predictor of Pneumonia and In-Hospital Death after Acute Ischemic Stroke in Chinese Populations.
26950337|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is a common complication and an important cause of death during hospitalization. The A2DS2 (Age, Atrial fibrillation, Dysphagia, Sex, Stroke Severity) score was developed from the Berlin Stroke Registry and showed good predictive value for predicting SAP. We sought to identify the association between the A2DS2 score and SAP, and, furthermore, to identify whether the A2DS2 score was a predictor for in-hospital death after acute ischemic stroke in a Chinese population. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. 1239 acute ischemic stroke patients were classified to low A2DS2 group (0-4) and high A2DS2 score (5-10) group. Primary outcome was in-hospital SAP. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the association between the A2DS2 score and SAP, and also the association between the A2DS2 score and in-hospital death. RESULTS: The overall incidence rates of SAP and in-hospital mortality after acute ischemic stroke were 7.3% and 2.4%, respectively. The incidence rate of SAP in low and high A2DS2 score groups was separately 3.3% and 24.7% (P<0.001). During hospitalization, 1.2% patients in low score group and 7.8% patients in high score group died (P<0.001). Multivariate regression demonstrated that patients in high score group had a higher risk of SAP (OR = 8.888, 95%CI: 5.552-14.229) and mortality (OR = 7.833, 95%CI: 3.580-17.137) than patients in low score group. CONCLUSIONS: The A2DS2 score was a strong predictor for SAP and in-hospital death of Chinese acute ischemic stroke patients. The A2DS2 score might be a useful tool for the identification of patients with a high risk of SAP and death during hospitalization.

26940836|t|Stroke related to androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.
26940836|a|BACKGROUND: Whether androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) leads to stroke morbidity is still unclear because of inconsistent evidence. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate if ADT used in men with prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases up to September 30th 2014 were systematically searched with no date or language restriction, and reports from potentially relevant journals were complementally searched. Both randomized controlled trials and observational studies were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Six observational studies finally met inclusion criteria, with 74,538 ADT users and 85,947 non-ADT users reporting stroke as an endpoint. Although no significant association was observed in pooled estimates, the incidence of stroke in ADT users was 12 % higher than control groups, (HR = 1.12, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.95 to 1.32; P = 0.16). In subgroup-analyses of different ADT types, stroke was found to be significantly associated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) alone (HR = 1.20, 95 % CI: 1.12 to 1.28; P < 0.001), GnRH plus oral antiandrogen (AA) (HR = 1.23, 95 % CI: 1.13 to 1.34; P < 0.001) and orchiectomy (HR = 1.37, 95 % CI: 1.33 to 1. 46; P = 0.001), but not with AA alone (HR = 1.06, 95 % CI: 0.71 to 1.57; P = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: GnRH alone, GnRH plus AA and orchiectomy is significantly associated with stroke in patients with PCa.

27036055|t|Cordyceps sinensis Oral Liquid Inhibits Damage Induced by Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation in SH-SY5Y Cells.
27036055|a|CONTEXT: Cordyceps sinensis has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. It has been demonstrated to have a variety of biological activities, and an extract of it has been demonstrated to possess a protective effect in occlusion-induced focal cerebral ischemia of the middle cerebral artery in rats. It could be explored as an agent for treatment of ischemic stroke, and the mechanisms need to be studied further. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to investigate the protective effects of the Cordyceps sinensis oral liquid (CSOL) against damage induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in SH-SY5Y cells. DESIGN • The research team designed an in vitro study. SETTING: The study occurred at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Shanghai, China. INTERVENTION: SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to CSOL in doses of 0.01, 0.03, 0.10, 0.30, and 1.00 mg/mL, creating 5 intervention groups. The OGD condition was induced by transfer of the cells from high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) in a box gassed with air containing 5% CO2 to glucose-free DMEM in a box gassed with 94% N2, 5% CO2, and 1% O2. Like the cells for the interventions groups, the cells for a model group were cultured with high-glucose DMEM and were transferred to the OGD, but they received no dose of COSL. Cells in a control group were cultured with high-glucose DMEM, were not transferred to the OGD condition, and did not receive any dose of COSL. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cell viability was assayed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The apoptosis and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were detected by flow cytometry, and the protein expression of caspase-3 was observed by western blot. RESULTS: After exposure to OGD, the cell viability of cells treated with 0.01, 0.03, 0.10, 0.30, and 1.00 mg/mL of CSOL increased in a dose-effect relationship. Compared with the cells in the model group, the treatment of CSOL at all the experimental concentrations significantly inhibited both the cell apoptosis (P < .01) and the capase-3 activation (P < .01). The MMP dissipation in the cells of the model group increased significantly compared with those of the control group (P < .01). The treatment with all doses of CSOL significantly inhibited the MMP dissipation (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: CSOL protects against the damage induced by OGD through inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in SH-SY5Y cells.

26772627|t|Preconditioning of H2S inhalation protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by induction of HSP70 through PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway.
26772627|a|It is of great importance to protect the brain against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, which leads to excitotoxicity, redox imbalance, inflammation and apoptosis; however, there is currently no effective treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of H2S preconditioning on cerebral I/R injury and its underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that H2S preconditioning significantly prevented the development of neurological function abnormality, inflammation and oxidative injury in mice as well as cognitive impairment caused by cerebral I/R. H2S preconditioning also suppressed the apoptosis caused by cerebral I/R. Moreover, the protective effect of H2S preconditioning was found to involve heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), in which the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway was involved. The data showed that H2S preconditioning could protect mice against cerebral I/R injury by the induction of HSP70 and the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway.

26903407|t|Rater experience influences reliability and validity of the Brief International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health Core Set for Stroke.
26903407|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate how clinical experience and access to patient information regarding functional capability influence inter-rater reliability and validity of the Brief International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health Core Set for Stroke (ICF) assessment. METHODS: Study 1 involved expert (clinical experience > 5 years) and novice (clinical experience < 2 years) rater-pairs, each evaluating the same post-stroke patients using the ICF assessment (n = 149). Study 2 involved novice raters separately evaluating a different cohort of post-stroke patients with the ICF assessment (n = 78). The novice raters had prior knowledge of patient functioning through conducting 6 clinical tests. RESULTS: For Study 1, the expert rater-pairs (kappa=0.50-0.85 for categories; intra-class correlation (ICC)=0.76-0.96 for components) had higher reliability coefficients than novice rater-pairs (kappa=0.18-0.69 for categories; ICC=0.63-0.88 for components). For Study 2, the novice raters with prior knowledge of patient's functioning yielded significantly higher ICF component scores than those without prior knowledge. The former raters' component scores were comparable to those of the expert rater-pairs. CONCLUSION: Clinical experience in post-stroke rehabilitation enhances inter-rater reliability of ICF assessment. Know-ledge of patient's functional capability, such as conducting common clinical tests in post-stroke rehabilitation, is useful for improving assessment validity.

27015174|t|Traditional Chinese Patent Medicine for Acute Ischemic Stroke: An Overview of Systematic Reviews Based on the GRADE Approach.
27015174|a|The aim of the study is to conduct an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) to provide a contemporary review of the evidence for delivery of Traditional Chinese Patent Medicine (TCPMs) for patients with acute ischemic stroke.SRs were assessed for quality using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the Oxman-Guyatt Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire (OQAQ). We assessed the quality of the evidence of high methodological quality (an AMSTAR score ≥9 or an OQAQ score ≥7) for reported outcomes using the GRADE (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.(1) Dan Shen agents: tiny trends toward the improvement in different neurological outcomes (RR = 1.16, 1.10, 1.23, 1.08, 1.12); (2) Mailuoning: a tiny trend toward improvement in the neurological outcome (RR = 1.18); (3) Ginkgo biloba: tiny trends toward improvement in the neurological outcome (RR = 1.18, MD = 0.81); (4) Dengzhanhua: a tiny trend toward an improvement in neurological (RR = 1.23); (5) Acanthopanax: a small positive (RR = 1.17, 1.31) result on neurological improvement reported; (6) Chuanxiong-type preparations: neurological functional improved (MD = 2.90);(7) Puerarin: no better effect on the rate of death or disability (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.35-1.87); (8) Milk vetch: no better effect on the rate of death (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.11-2.83);(9) Qingkailing: rate of death reduced (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.11-2.83). Limitations in the methodological quality of the RCTs, inconsistency and imprecision led to downgrading of the quality of the evidence, which varied by review and by outcome. Consequently, there are currently only weak evidences to support those TCPMs.The 9 TCPMs may be effective in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, as the GRADE approach indicated a weak recommendation for those TCPMs' usage.

26780954|t|Opposing needling promotes behavior recovery and exerts neuroprotection via the cAMP/PKA/CREB signal transduction pathway in transient MCAO rats.
26780954|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the cyclic adenosine 3',5'‑monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A(PKA)/cAMP‑responsive element binding protein (CREB) signal transduction pathway triggered by γ‑aminobutyric acid class B (GABA(B)) receptor activation is involved in neuroprotection against ischemia and behavioral recovery induced by opposing needling (ON). A total of 80 rats were randomly divided into four groups: A sham operation group, an ischemia group, an ON group and an ON group effectively inhibited by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist, CGP35384 (n=20/group). The behavior of the rats was assessed by their neurological deficit score, whereas the impairment of gait was examined using the CatWalk system. The volume of cerebral infarction was examined upon treatment with 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride. The expression levels of CREB, GABA(B1) and GABA(B2) were examined by western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC), cAMP and PKA in the serum was detected using an enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. In the present study, in comparison with other groups, the ON group exhibited a reduced score for the neurological deficit, the stride length and swing speed were improved, and the volume of infarction was reduced. However, these effects were reversed upon administration of CGP35384. Additionally, the expression levels of CREB, GABA(B1) and GABA(B2) were increased in the ON group. The levels of AC, cAMP and PKA in the serum were also increased in the ON group, whereas the addition of CGP35384 reversed these effects. The results of the present study demonstrated that ON markedly protected the brain against transient cerebral ischemic injury, and this effect was possibly mediated by the activation of the GABAB/cAMP/PKA/CREB signal transduction pathway. These findings implied that ON may be a potential therapeutic method for treating stroke.

25918972|t|Effect of ninjin'yoeito, a Kampo (traditional Japanese) medicine, on cognitive impairment and depression in patients with Alzheimer's disease: 2 years of observation.
25918972|a|BACKGROUND: Only a few approved drugs are capable of alleviating the cognitive and behavioural symptoms of people living with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, however, the number of studies examining the clinical effects of herbal medicines on cognitive function in patients with AD has increased considerably. This study evaluated the long-term effects of a traditional Japanese medicine (Kampo medicine) known as ninjin'yoeito (NYT) on cognitive impairment and mood status in patients with AD over a 2-year period. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with mild-to-moderate probable AD according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria were included. Each participant had exhibited an insufficient response to treatment with donepezil alone before the start of the trial. Eleven patients received treatment with donepezil alone, and the remaining patients received a combined treatment of donepezil and NYT for 2 years. Patients were assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive component-Japanese version for cognitive function, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to evaluate the patients' mood status at baseline and every 6 months for 2 years. RESULTS: The Mini-Mental State Examination results showed no significant differences between the two groups. Significant improvements were observed on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive component-Japanese version and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory depression scores of patients who received the combined therapy with donepezil and NYT (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive component-Japanese version, 12 months: P < 0.01, 18 months: P = 0.04, 24 months: P < 0.01; Neuropsychiatric Inventory depression, 6 months: P < 0.05, 24 months: P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A 2-year follow-up of patients receiving donepezil and NYT treatment showed an improved cognitive outcome and alleviation of AD-related depression.

28875680|t|[Effects of Tongluo Xingnao effervescent tablets on blood rheology, iNOS, VEGF and LDH-5 in MID rats].
28875680|a|The study was to explore effects of Tongluo Xingnao effervescent tablets on the blood rheology, iNOS, VEGF and LDH-5 in multi-infarct dementia(MID) model rats. Establish MID model rats were induced by microthrombosis, from which 50 successful model rats were randomly divided into five groups, such as the model control group, the dihydroergotoxine mesylate tablets(hydergine) group(0.7 mg•kg⁻¹), Tongluo Xingnao effervescent tablets high-dose, medium-dose and low-dose groups(7.56, 3.78, 1.89 g•kg⁻¹). Another ten rats in the sham group were randomly selected as the parallel control group. Each group was orally administered with drugs for 90 days. The learning and memory ability was evaluated with the Morris water maze test, while the whole blood viscosity and the erythrocyte aggregation index derived from abdominal aorta were measured in different shear rates. In addition, the levels of VEGF and iNOS in the serum were determined by ELISA kits. The expression of LDH-5 in hippocampus of rats was measured with immunohistochemistry and image quantitative analysis. The result showed that Tongluo Xingnao effervescent tablets notably decreased the escape latency of MID model rats, increased times of entering into the escape platform and prolonged retention time in medium ring, meanwhile the whole blood viscosity in MID model rats was also notably reduced in four shear rates, i.e. 1, 5, 30, 200 S⁻¹, erythrocyte aggregation index, serum VEGF and iNOS, and average optical density value of LDH-5, with a statistically significant differences compared with the model control group (P<0.05). In conclusion, Tongluo Xingnao effervescent tablets could improve the ability of learning and memory of MID model rats and the blood rheology, reduce the level of iNOS, VEGF and the expression of LDH-5, and then improved the brain energy supply.

26806865|t|Serum miR-132 is a risk marker of post-stroke cognitive impairment.
26806865|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently, it has been reported that the microRNA-132(miR-132) is linked with synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment. The present study investigates that whether miR-132 is altered in circulating blood serum samples of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) patients. METHODS: We collected samples from 39 subjects with PSCI, 37 subjects with post-stroke cognitive normality (PSCN), and 38 age-matched controls (AMC) for which ages, gender and education level were matched. MiR-132 was detected using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method. To test the predictive value of miR-132 for PSCI, prediction capabilities were compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under curve (AUC) analysis. RESULTS: The level of miR-132 in PSCI patient serum was significantly elevated compared to that of PSCN and AMC subjects. The ROC curve showed that miR-132 achieved an AUC of 0.961 (p<0.0001). Importantly, the miR-132 level was correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score in PSCI patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that there was a substantial correlation between serum miR-132 expression and post-stroke cognitive functionality, suggesting that miR-132 may be a risk marker for PSCI. Because of the limitations of this study, the results should be treated with caution.

26895969|t|Effectiveness and safety of ShenXiong glucose injection for acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and GRADE approach.
26895969|a|BACKGROUND: To appraise critically whether published trials of ShenXiong glucose injection for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are of sufficient quality, and in addition to rate the quality of evidence by using the GRADE approach (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation, GRADE). METHODS: A literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CBM, Chinese TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) Database, CNKI, VIP, WanFang Databases until January 2015. The limits were patients with AIS and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs. Studies by which patients suffering intracerebral haemorrhage were excluded. RESULTS: Twelve studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We found significant benefits of ShenXiong glucose injection compared with conventional treatment in improving activities of daily living function at 4 weeks (MD = 34.12, 95 % CI: 29.07, 39.17), neurological function deficit at 2 weeks (MD = -5.39, 95% CI: -6.90, -3.87), 4 weeks (MD = -5.16, 95 % CI: -6.49, -3.83), and clinical effects at 4 weeks (RR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.24). No trials reported the effects of ShenXiong glucose injection on the risk of early, deterioration, or quality of life. No adverse events were reported within the whole follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ShenXiong glucose injection may improve rehabilitation for patients with acute ischemic stroke, however, as the GRADE approach indicated low to moderate quality of available evidence as well as insufficient information about harm and patients preference, the recommendations were not provided for ShenXiong glucose injection taking as a therapeutic intervention to patients with acute ischemic stroke.

27158378|t|Activation of the calcium-sensing receptor promotes apoptosis by modulating the JNK/p38 MAPK pathway in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in mice.
27158378|a|Exact mechanism of cerebral ischemic stroke remains unclear. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein coupled receptor, has been reported to participate in the pathology of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and myocardial hypertrophy. Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies have been conducted to investigate the role of CaSR in cerebral ischemic stroke. This study was to investigate the effect of CaSR activation on cerebral ischemic stroke. Male adult Kunming mice were subjected to 2-h focal cerebral ischemia followed by 22-h reperfusion. Then, the brain was collected, and the expression of CaSR, JNK, p38, Bcl-2, and Bax was detected by Western blot assay. The morphology of neurons in the brain was evaluated by HE staining. Neurological function was scored, and the infarct volume was determined by TTC (triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining. Results showed that ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) increased CaSR expression and induced neuronal apoptosis in the brain. Gadolinium trichloride (GdCl3), an agonist of CaSR, further deteriorated neurological dysfunction, increased infarct volume, enhanced CaSR expression, and promoted neuronal apoptosis. In addition, GdCl3 unregulated expression of Bax, p-JNK, and p-p38, and down-regulated Bcl-2 expression during I/R, which were attenuated by NPS2390, an inhibitor of CaSR. In conclusion, the CaSR activation promotes apoptosis in focal cerebral I/R in mice, which may be related to the activation of JNK/p38 MAPK signalling pathway. Targeting CaSR may be a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of cerebral ischemic stroke.

26878162|t|Synthesis and biological evaluation of n-butylphthalide derivatives as anti-platelet aggregation agents.
26878162|a|New analogues of n-butylphthalide (NBP) bearing various lengths of alkyl and different substitution at the two-position of phthalide were designed and synthesised. Preliminary evaluation and prediction of ACD LogP software indicate that the derivatives display significant improvement in water solubility than NBP does. Further biological analysis showed that NBP analogues specifically inhibit platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid but have no effect on that induced by adenosine 5-diphosphate. Especially compounds 1 and 3 were stronger than classical anti-platelet drug, aspirin, and equal potent with NBP, respectively. These findings provide an alternative approach to the development of NBP analogues with anti-platelet aggregation activity with good water solubility for the intervention of ischemic stroke.

26657578|t|Induced cortical neurogenesis after focal cerebral ischemia--Three active components from Huang-Lian-Jie-Du Decoction.
26657578|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinical prescription noted for its neuroprotective effects. The total alkaloids, flavonoids, and iridoids are the main active components of HLJDD. In the present study we explored the possible effects of the total alkaloids, flavonoids, and iridoids from HLJDD on behavioral recovery and cortical neurogenesis after stroke. METHODS: The stroke model was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMACO). The total alkaloids (44 mg/kg), flavonoids (50 mg/kg), and iridoids (80 mg/kg) from HLJDD were orally administered for 2h after stroke and daily thereafter. Neurological function was assessed and then rats were sacrificed 7 days after pMACO. Following repeated intraperitoneal injections of the cell proliferation - specific marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) after stroke induction, precursor cell proliferation and differentiation was monitored by immunofluorescent staining. The levels of relevant proteins were determined by western blotting and the mRNA expressions were assessed by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Total alkaloids, flavonoids and iridoids from HLJDD showed improved functional outcome after brain ischemia. The total alkaloids and iridoids increased number of BrdU-positive cells and enhanced neuronal differentiation in the cortex. Alkaloids-enhanced neurogenesis might be associated with increased VEGF, Ang-1, and Ang-2 protein expression. And the neuroproliferative effect of alkaloids was partially correlated with increased phosphorylation of AKT, and GSK-3β. Flavonoids treatment was found to promote differentiation of cortical precursor cells into neuronal but not glial cells, which may be at least attributable to the regulation of AKT, GSK-3β mRNA and Ang-1 protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: Total alkaloids, iridoids and flavonoids from HLJDD promoted functional recovery likely via enhancing cortical neurogenesis and thus have potential as a treatment for ischemic brain injury.

26657497|t|Anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic effect of a traditional herbal medicine Kyung-Ok-Ko.
26657497|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Kyung-Ok-Ko (KOK), a traditional herbal prescription, contains six main ingredients; Rehmannia glutinosa var. purpurae, Lycium chinense, Aquillaria agallocha, Poria cocos, Panax ginseng, and honey. KOK has been widely taken as a traditional oriental medicine for improving blood circulation or age-related symptoms, such as dementia and stroke. However, the effect of KOK on platelet activity has not been clarified. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the effect of KOK on platelet function, we evaluated its effect on functional markers of platelet activation such as aggregation and shape change. As a mechanism study for the effect of KOK, we examined its effect on granule secretion, intracellular Ca(2+) increase, and PLCγ and Akt activation. To investigate the effect of orally administered KOK (0.5, 1, 2 g/kg), we examined its ex vivo effect on platelet aggregation in rat, and its in vivo anti-thrombotic effect in mice thromboembolism model. Furthermore, the effect of KOK on bleeding time was examined to estimate its potential side effect. RESULTS: KOK (0.3, 1, 3, 10 mg/ml) inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation and shape change in rat platelets in a concentration-dependent manner. The mechanism for the anti-platelet effect of KOK seems to involve the inhibition of ATP release, intracellular Ca(2+) elevation, and the phosphorylation of PLCγ and Akt. In rat ex vivo study, KOK (2 g/kg, p.o. for 1 day, and 0.5, 1, 2 g/kg, p.o. for 7 days) also had significant inhibitory effects on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In addition, KOK showed a significant protective effect against thrombosis attack in mice. The prolongation of bleeding time by KOK was much less than that by ASA, suggesting a beneficial potential of KOK than ASA in view of side effect. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that KOK elicits remarkable anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic effects with less side effect of bleeding, and therefore, it may have a therapeutic potential for the prevention of platelet-associated cardiovascular diseases.

26830013|t|Crosstalk between miRNAs and their regulated genes network in stroke.
26830013|a|In recent years, more and more studies focus on the roles of genes or miRNAs in stroke. However, the molecular mechanism connecting miRNAs and their targetgenes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the differential regulation and correlations between miRNAs and their targetgenes in human stroke. Stroke-related miRNAs were obtained from the Human MicroRNA Disease Database (HMDD) and their targetgenes were generated from three independent sources. Kappa score was used to create the network and the functional modules. A total of 11 stroke-related miRNAs were identified from the HMDD and 441 overlapping targetgenes were extracted from the three databases. By network construction and GO analysis, 13 functional modules, 186 biological processes, and 21 pathways were found in the network, of which functional module 8 was the largest module, cellular-related process and phosphate-related process were the most important biological processes, and MAPK signaling pathway was the most significant pathway. In our study, all miRNAs regulate the stroke modular network by their targetgenes. After the validation of miRNAs, we found that miR-605 and miR-181d were highly expressed in the blood of stroke patients which never reported before may supply novel target for treatment.

26575184|t|Anti-Inflammatory and Neuroprotective Effects of Triptolide via the NF-κB Signaling Pathway in a Rat MCAO Model.
26575184|a|Stroke is the leading cause of neurological disability in humans. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion is widely accepted to mimic stroke in basic medical research. Triptolide is one of the major active components of the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, and has been reported to have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Since its preclinical effects on stroke were still unclear, we decided to study the effects of Triptolide on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in this study. The results showed that Triptolide treatment significantly attenuates brain infarction volume, water content, neurological deficits, and neuronal cell death rate, which were increased in the MCAO model rats. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide (iNOS), and NF-κB in the ischemic brains. The administration of Triptolide showed down-regulation of the iNOS, COX-2, GFAP, and NF-κB expression in MCAO rats. It also increased the expression of bcl-2, and suppressed levels of bax and caspase-3 compared with the MCAO group. Our findings revealed that Triptolide exerts its neuroprotective effects against inflammation with the involvement of inhibition of NF-κB activation.

26749220|t|Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Amygdalin and Paeoniflorin After Single and Multiple Intravenous Infusions of Huoxue-Tongluo Lyophilized Powder for Injection in Healthy Chinese Volunteers.
26749220|a|PURPOSE: Huoxue-Tongluo lyophilized powder for injection (HTLPI), a traditional Chinese medicine preparation, is a compound of Persicae semen and Paeoniae Radix Rubra that is used mainly for treating blood-stasis obstruction syndrome in the acute stage of cerebral ischemic stroke. Amygdalin (AD) and paeoniflorin (PF) are 2 typical bioactive components in HTLPI and were selected as indicators for this pharmacokinetic study of HTLPI. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety profile, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic properties of AD and PF after single and multiple intravenous infusions of HTLPI in healthy Chinese volunteers. METHODS: Twenty-one healthy Chinese subjects were recruited for this open-label, single ascending-dose (3, 6, and 9 g) and multiple-dose (6 g, once daily) study. Safety profile was assessed by adverse events and physical examination throughout the study. Serial plasma and urine samples were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic parameters of AD and PF were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. FINDINGS: In the single-dose phase of the study, the mean maximum plasma concentration and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve of AD and PF increased proportionally with each dose escalation. In the multiple-dose phase, the steady state was achieved by day 4 after multiple-dose administration of 6 g HTLPI. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters achieved on day 1 were similar to those on day 7. No significant accumulation was observed after repeat doses of 6 g HTLPI. Approximately 79.6% of the administered AD and 48.4% of the administered PF were excreted unchanged in urine within 24 hours. No serious adverse events were observed during the entire study. IMPLICATIONS: The pharmacokinetic properties of AD and PF were linear after a single intravenous infusion of HTLPI in the dose range of 3-9 g. No systemic accumulation was observed with repeat doses of HTLPI. Sex had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of AD and PF. Intravenous infusion of HTLPI was well tolerated in healthy Chinese subjects.

26647915|t|Electroacupuncture protects against ischemic stroke by reducing autophagosome formation and inhibiting autophagy through the mTORC1-ULK1 complex-Beclin1 pathway.
26647915|a|In a previous study by our group, we demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) activates the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. There is considerable evidence that the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays an important role in autophagy following ischemic stroke. The aim of the present study was to determine whether EA exerts a neuroprotective effect through mTORC1-mediated autophagy following ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our results revealed that EA at the LI11 and ST36 acupoints attenuated motor dysfunction, improved neurological deficit outcomes and decreased the infarct volumes. The number of autophagosomes, autolysosomes and lysosomes was decreased following treatment with EA. Simultaneously, the levels of the autophagosome membrane maker, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B)Ⅱ/Ⅰ, Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), autophagy related gene 13 Atg13) and Beclin1 (ser14) were decreased, whereas mTORC1 expression was increased in the peri-infarct cortex. These results suggest that EA protects against ischemic stroke through the inhibition of autophagosome formation and autophagy, which is mediated through the mTORC1-ULK complex-Beclin1 pathway.

26886655|t|Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Xingnaojing Injection on Consciousness Disturbance.
26886655|a|Xingnaojing (XNJ) is commonly extracted from Angongniuhuang, a classic Chinese emergency prescription, and widely used in the treatment of nervous system disorders including consciousness disturbance in China. To evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of XNJ injection, on consciousness disturbance. Seven major electronic databases were searched to retrieve randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of XNJ alone or combined with Western medicine in treating consciousness disturbance caused by conditions such as high fever, poisoning, and stroke. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using criteria from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions, and analyzed using the RevMan 5.3.0 software. Seventeen randomized controlled trials on XNJ were included in this study and the trials generally showed low methodological quality. The results revealed that XNJ alone or in combination with other medicines and adjuvant methods had a positive effect on patients with fever-, poisoning-, and stroke-induced coma. XNJ effectively treated consciousness disturbances that were caused by high fever, poisoning, or stroke.

26871777|t|Changes of Brain Connectivity in the Primary Motor Cortex After Subcortical Stroke: A Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.
26871777|a|The authors investigated the changes in connectivity networks of the bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) of subcortical stroke patients using a multimodal neuroimaging approach with antiplatelet therapy. Nineteen patients were scanned at 2 time points: before and 1 month after the treatment. The authors assessed the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) and probabilistic fiber tracking of left and right M1 of every patient, and then compared these results to the 15 healthy controls. The authors also evaluated the correlations between the neuroimaging results and clinical scores.Compared with the controls, the patients showed a significant decrease of FC in the contralateral motor cortex before treatment, and the disrupted FC was restored after treatment. The fiber tracking results in the controls indicated that the body of the corpus callosum should be the main pathway connecting the M1 and contralateral hemispheres. All patients exhibited reduced probability of structural connectivity within this pathway before treatment and which was restored after treatment. Significant correlations were also found in these patients between the connectivity results and clinical scores, which might imply that the connectivity of M1 can be used to evaluate the motor skills in stroke patients.These findings can help elucidate the neural mechanisms responsible for the brain connectivity recovery after stroke.

26718002|t|Electroacupuncture inhibits inflammatory injury by targeting the miR-9-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway following ischemic stroke.
26718002|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective mechanism of the miR-9-mediated activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway by electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation of the Quchi (LI11) and Zusanli (ST36) acupoints in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The present study demonstrated that EA alleviated the symptoms of neurological deficits and reduced the infarct volume in the rat brains. The expression of miR-9 in the peri-infarct cortex was increased in the EA group compared with the MCAO group, and the expression of NF-κB signaling pathway-associated factors, NF-κB p65, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β were reduced. Notably, miR-9 inhibitors were revealed to have the ability to suppress EA-alleviated cerebral inflammation and the expression of NF-κB downstream-related factors, NF-κB p65, TNF-α and IL-1β, and caused no alteration on the level of NF-κB upstream-related protein inhibitor of κBα, suggesting that the cerebral protective efficacy of EA targets miR-9-mediated NF-κB downstream pathway following ischemic stroke.

27073382|t|Tongguan Liqiao acupuncture therapy improves dysphagia after brainstem stroke.
27073382|a|Tongguan Liqiao acupuncture therapy has been shown to effectively treat dysphagia after stroke-based pseudobulbar paralysis. We presumed that this therapy would be effective for dysphagia after bulbar paralysis in patients with brainstem infarction. Sixty-four patients with dysphagia following brainstem infarction were recruited and divided into a medulla oblongata infarction group (n = 22), a midbrain and pons infarction group (n = 16), and a multiple cerebral infarction group (n = 26) according to their magnetic resonance imaging results. All patients received Tongguan Liqiao acupuncture for 28 days. The main acupoints were Neiguan (PC6), Renzhong (DU26), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Fengchi (GB20), Wangu (GB12), and Yifeng (SJ17). Furthermore, the posterior pharyngeal wall was pricked. Before and after treatment, patient swallowing functions were evaluated with the Kubota Water Test, Fujishima Ichiro Rating Scale, and the Standard Swallowing Assessment. The Barthel Index was also used to evaluate their quality of life. Results showed that after 28 days of treatment, scores on the Kubota Water Test and Standard Swallowing Assessment had decreased, but scores on the Fujishima Ichiro Rating Scale and Barthel Index had increased in each group. The total efficacy rate was 92.2% after treatment, and was most obvious in patients with medulla oblongata infarction (95.9%). These findings suggest that Tongguan Liqiao acupuncture therapy can repair the connection of upper motor neurons to the medulla oblongata motor nucleus, promote the recovery of brainstem infarction, and improve patient's swallowing ability and quality of life.

28868875|a|In this study, formulas containing Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma-Carthami Flos in the database of Dictionary of Chinese Medicine Prescription (DCMP) were extracted by using traditional Chinese medicine inheritance support system (TCMISS). The drugs pairs and formula composition rules were analyzed with data mining methods, such as association rules, improved mutual information method and complex system entropy clustering. Totally 39 formulas were included in this study and involved 280 Chinese medicines. The top 5 Chinese medicines most frequently used were Danggui (Angelica sinensis), Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), Xiangfu (Cyperi Rhizoma), Baishao(Radix Paeoniae Alba), Taoren(Prunus persica) and Shengdihuang (Radix Rehmanniae Recens). Six core medicinal pairs were obtained through clustering analysis, namely Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma)-Xiangfu (Cyperi Rhizoma)-Honghua (Carthami Flos), Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma)-Baishao (Radix Paeoniae Alba)-Honghua (Carthami Flos), Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma)-Danggui (A. sinensis)-Xiagnfu (Cyperi Rhizoma)-Honghua (Carthami Flos), Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma)-Danggui (A. sinensis)-Baishao (Radix Paeoniae Alba)-Honghua (Carthami Flos), Honghua (Carthami Flos)-Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma)-Baishao (Radix Paeoniae Alba)-Danggui (A. sinensis), Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma)-Baishao (Radix Paeoniae Alba)-Honghua (Carthami Flos)-Danggui (A. sinensis). The support degree was set at 11 (38.46%), with a confidence coefficient of 80%, and then 38 associated pairs were screened. These results suggested that Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Carthami Flos is often combined with herbs for activating blood and promoting circulation of qi to treat gynecopathy, stasis blood pain syndrome, stroke and other syndromes.

26825080|t|Xiaoke Pill () and anti-diabetic drugs: A review on clinical evidence of possible herb-drug interactions.
26825080|a|OBJECTIVE: To critically analyze the clinically-based evidence of herb-drug interaction on Xiaoke Pill () and its concomitant use with anti-diabetic drugs. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM), Traditional Chinese Medical Database System (TCMDS), China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI) and Wangfang Databases were searched. Levels of Evidence and Severity Level of Interaction were used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies published in Chinese, including 2 randomized controlled trials, 3 case series and 22 case reports, were included. Eighteen herbdrug interactions were reported involving Xiaoke Pill as monotherapy, while 6 herb-drug interactions occurred associated with Xiaoke Pill in combination with anti-diabetic drugs. The clinical results of herb-drug interaction of Xiaoke Pill were reported as additive blood glucose-lowering effects with anti-diabetic drugs, including benefifi cial and adverse hypoglycemic effects, anaphylactic shock and severe hair loss. Of these interactions 82.8% were reported to be associated with potential deterioration of the patients' conditions including hypoglycemic coma, stroke, mental disorder and even death. CONCLUSIONS: This review helped establish the clinically-based evidence about herb-drug interaction of Xiaoke Pill and its concomitant use with anti-diabetic drugs. The fifi ndings would help arouse the awareness of both health professionals and the general public to avoid the adverse herb-drug interactions of Xiaoke Pill in healthcare and community settings.

26813160|t|Neuron-derived FGF10 ameliorates cerebral ischemia injury via inhibiting NF-κB-dependent neuroinflammation and activating PI3K/Akt survival signaling pathway in mice.
26813160|a|FGF10 is a member of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). We previously showed that FGF10 protects neuron against oxygen-glucose deprivation injury in vitro; however, the effect of FGF10 in ischemic stroke in vivo is unknown. In the present study, we showed that FGF10 was mainly expressed in neurons but not astrocytes, and detected FGF10 in mouse cerebrospinal fluid. The FGF10 levels in neurons culture medium and cell lysate were much higher than those in astrocytes. FGF10 expression in brain tissue and FGF10 level in CSF were increased in mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Administration of FGF10 into lateral cerebroventricle not only decreased MCAO-induced brain infarct volume and neurological deficit, but also reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells and activities of Caspases. Moreover, FGF10 treatment depressed the triggered inflammatory factors (TNF-α and IL-6) and NF-κB signaling pathway, and increased phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Blockade of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by wortmannin and Akt1/2-kinase inhibitor, partly compromised the neuroprotection of FGF10. However, blockade of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway did not impair the anti-inflammation action of FGF10. Collectively, our results demonstrate that neuron-derived FGF10 ameliorates cerebral ischemia injury via inhibiting NF-κB-dependent neuroinflammation and activating PI3K/Akt survival signaling pathway in mice.

26806793|a|This study aimed to investigate the potential associations between carotid intima-media thickness and cognitive impairment among patients with acute ischemic stroke and to identify the clinical implications. We measured carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and performed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) upon the admission of 1,826 acute ischemic stroke patients. The association between IMT and cognitive impairment evaluated by the MMSE was assessed with a multivariate regression analysis. Other clinical variables of interest were also assessed. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants in the highest IMT quartile had a higher likelihood of having cognitive impairments compared with the lowest IMT quartile (odds ratio: 3.01, 95% confidence interval: 2.07-4.37, p < 0.001). Stratified analyses indicated that this positive correlation was similar for the maxIMT and meanIMT of carotid artery measurements. A positive correlation was found between IMT and cognitive impairment in participants with acute ischemic stroke.

26790818|t|Tubastatin A, an HDAC6 inhibitor, alleviates stroke-induced brain infarction and functional deficits: potential roles of α-tubulin acetylation and FGF-21 up-regulation.
26790818|a|Histone deacetylase (HDAC) 6 exists exclusively in cytoplasm and deacetylates cytoplasmic proteins such as α-tubulin. HDAC6 dysfunction is associated with several pathological conditions in the central nervous system. This study investigated the beneficial effects of tubastatin A (TubA), a novel specific HDAC6 inhibitor, in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and an in vitro model of excitotoxicity. Post-ischemic TubA treatment robustly improved functional outcomes, reduced brain infarction, and ameliorated neuronal cell death in MCAO rats. These beneficial effects lasted at least three days after MCAO. Notably, when given at 24 hours after MCAO, TubA still exhibited significant protection. Levels of acetylated α-tubulin were decreased in the ischemic hemisphere on Days 1 and 3 after MCAO, and were significantly restored by TubA. MCAO markedly downregulated fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21) and TubA significantly reversed this downregulation. TubA also mitigated impaired FGF-21 signaling in the ischemic hemisphere, including up-regulating β-Klotho, and activating ERK and Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathways. In addition, both TubA and exogenous FGF-21 conferred neuroprotection and restored mitochondrial trafficking in rat cortical neurons against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Our findings suggest that the neuroprotective effects of TubA likely involve HDAC6 inhibition and the subsequent up-regulation of acetylated α-tubulin and FGF-21.

26834461|t|YiQiFuMai powder injection ameliorates blood-brain barrier dysfunction and brain edema after focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice.
26834461|a|YiQiFuMai powder injection (YQFM) is a modern preparation derived from the traditional Chinese medicine Sheng-Mai-San. YQFM is widely used in clinical practice in the People's Republic of China, mainly for the treatment of microcirculatory disturbance-related diseases. However, little is known about its role in animals with ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of YQFM on brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Male C57BL/6J mice underwent right middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 hour with a subsequent 24-hour reperfusion to produce I/R injury. YQFM (three doses: 0.336, 0.671, and 1.342 g/kg) was then given intraperitoneally (IP). The results demonstrated that YQFM significantly decreased infarct size, improved neurological deficits, reduced brain water content, and increased cerebral blood flow after I/R injury. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose micro-positron emission tomography imaging and hematoxylin and eosin staining results indicated that YQFM is able to ameliorate brain metabolism and histopathological damage after I/R. Moreover, YQFM administration reduced BBB leakage and upregulated the expression of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, which was confirmed by Evans Blue extravasation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence assay. Our findings suggest that YQFM provides protection against focal cerebral I/R injury in mice, possibly by improving BBB dysfunction via upregulation of the expression of tight junction proteins.

26793066|t|Clematichinenoside Serves as a Neuroprotective Agent Against Ischemic Stroke: The Synergistic Action of ERK1/2 and cPKC Pathways.
26793066|a|There are numerous evidences suggesting that inhibition of apoptosis of neurons play a critical role in preventing the damage and even death of neurons after brain ischemia/reperfusion, which shows therapeutic potential for clinical treatment of brain injury induced by stroke. In this study, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of Clematichinenoside (AR) and its underlying mechanisms. MCAO mode was performed in rats and OGD/R model in primary cortical neurons to investigate the neuroprotective effect of AR. The rate of apoptotic cells was measured using TUNEL assay in cerebral cortex and flow cytometric assay in cortical neurons. Apoptosis-related proteins such as bcl-2, bcl-xl, and bax and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, cPKC, p90RSK, and CREB in ischemic penumbra were assayed by western blot. Furthermore, we made a thorough inquiry about how these proteins play roles in the anti-apoptotic mechanism using targets-associated inhibitors step by step. The results revealed that AR could activate both ERK1/2 and cPKC which resulted in p90RSK phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus. Moreover, CREB, a downstream target of p90RSK, was phosphorylated and then bound to cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE) to activate apoptosis-related genes, and finally ameliorate ischemic stroke through preventing neuron death. In conclusion, these data strongly suggest that AR could be used as an effective neuroprotective agent to protect against ischemic stroke after cerebral I/R injury through regulating both ERK1/2 and cPKC mediated p90RSK/CREB apoptotic pathways.

26593214|t|Outcomes after stroke in patients receiving adjuvant therapy with traditional Chinese medicine: A nationwide matched interventional cohort study.
26593214|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was high in stroke patients but limited information was available on whether TCM is effective on post-stroke outcomes. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of stroke patients with and without receiving adjuvant TCM therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we conducted a nationwide cohort study and selected hospitalized stroke patients receiving routine care with (n=1734) and without (n=1734) in-hospital adjuvant TCM therapy by propensity score matching procedures. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of poststroke complications and mortality associated with in-hospital adjuvant TCM therapy were calculated. The use of medical resource was also compared between stroke patients with and without adjuvant TCM therapy. RESULTS: Compared with hospitalized stroke patients receiving routine care alone, hospitalized stroke patients receiving routine care and adjuvant TCM therapy exhibited decreased risks of urinary tract infection (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68-1.00), pneumonia (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47-0.76), epilepsy (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.96), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-0.98), and mortality (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.70) within 3 months after stroke admission. The corresponding 6-month HRs for urinary tract infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and mortality were 0.83, 0.63, 0.64, and 0.40, respectively. Less use and expenditure of hospitalization were found in those received adjuvant TCM therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized stroke patients who received routine care and adjuvant TCM therapy exhibited reduced adverse outcomes after admission within a 6-month follow-up period.

26739742|t|Acupuncture treatment for ischaemic stroke in young adults: protocol for a randomised, sham-controlled clinical trial.
26739742|a|INTRODUCTION: Stroke in young adults is not uncommon. Although the overall incidence of stroke has been recently declining, the incidence of stroke in young adults is increasing. Traditional vascular risk factors are the main cause of young ischaemic stroke. Acupuncture has been shown to benefit stroke rehabilitation and ameliorate the risk factors for stroke. The aims of this study were to determine whether acupuncture treatment will be effective in improving the activities of daily living (ADL), motor function and quality of life (QOL) in patients of young ischaemic stroke, and in preventing stroke recurrence by controlling blood pressure, lipids and body weight. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this randomised, sham-controlled, participant-blinded and assessor-blinded clinical trial, 120 patients between 18 and 45 years of age with a recent (within 1 month) ischaemic stroke will be randomised for an 8-week acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment. The primary outcome will be the Barthel Index for ADL. The secondary outcomes will include the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for motor function; the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) for QOL; and risk factors that are measured by ambulatory blood pressure, the fasting serum lipid, body mass index and waist circumference. Incidence of adverse events and long-term mortality and recurrence rate during a 10-year and 30-year follow-up will also be investigated. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University. Protocol V.3 was approved in June 2013. The results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international congresses. The results will also be disseminated to patients by telephone during follow-up calls enquiring on the patient's post-study health status.

27671812|t|Emodin and Its Role in Chronic Diseases.
27671812|a|Diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes, are by far the leading cause of mortality in the world, representing 60 % of all deaths. Although substantial medical advances have been made and many therapeutic approaches proposed yet traditional medicine and medicinal plants find an important place in therapy. They have been providing invaluable solutions to the various health problems. Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is a natural anthraquinone derivative found in various Chinese medicinal herbs. Traditionally, it has been used as an active constituent of many herbal laxatives. However, in the last few years, significant progress has been made in studying the biological effects of emodin at cellular and molecular levels and it is emerging as an important therapeutic agent. This review provides an overview of the modulatory effects of emodin in various diseases and cell signaling pathways, which may have important implications in its future clinical use.

26053189|t|Aerobic Interval Training Elicits Different Hemodynamic Adaptations Between Heart Failure Patients with Preserved and Reduced Ejection Fraction.
26053189|a|OBJECTIVE: This investigation explored how aerobic interval training influences central or peripheral hemodynamic response(s) to exercise in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or those with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). DESIGN: One hundred twenty HF patients were divided into four groups: HFpEF and HFrEF with aerobic interval training (3-min intervals at 40% and 80% VO2peak for 30 mins/day, 3 days/wk for 12 wks) and general health care groups. Exercise hemodynamics in the heart, frontal cerebral lobe, and vastus lateralis muscle, and oxygenation in the frontal cerebral lobe and vastus lateralis muscle were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Aerobic interval training significantly (1) improved pumping function with enhanced peak cardiac power index in the HFrEF group and improved diastolic function with reduction of the E/E' ratio in the HFpEF group, (2) increased blood distribution to the frontal cerebral lobe/vastus lateralis muscle and O2 extraction by vastus lateralis muscle during exercise in the HFpEF group compared with the HFrEF group, (3) heightened VO2peak in both HFpEF and HFrEF groups and lowered the VE/VCO2 slope in the HFpEF group, and (4) increased the Short Form-36 physical/mental component scores and decreased the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire score in both HFpEF and HFrEF groups. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic interval training effectively enhances cardiac hemodynamic response to exercise in HFrEF patients while increasing the delivery/use of O2 to exercising skeletal muscles and frontal cerebral lobe tissues in HFpEF patients, thereby improving global/disease-specific quality-of-life measures in these HF patients.

Scutellarin is the major ingredient of E. breviscapus and scutellarein is one of the main bioactive metabolites of scutellarin in vivo, but the latter's pharmacological activities have not been fully characterized. Provided evidence that could inhibit platelet aggregation, the effect of scutellarein on rat washed platelets and its underlying mechanisms were evaluated in our research. Scutellarein inhibited platelet adhesion and aggregation induced by multiple G protein coupled receptor agonists such as thrombin, U46619 and ADP, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mild effect of scutellarein on intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and cyclic AMP (cAMP) level was observed. On the other hand, the role of scutellarein as potential protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor was confirmed by PKC activity analysis and molecular docking. The phorbol myristate acetate-induced platelets aggregation assay with or without ADP implied that the scutellarein takes PKC(s) as its primary target(s), and acts on it in a reversible way. Finally, scutellarein as a promising agent exhibited a high inhibition effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation among its analogues. This study clarifies the PKC-related signaling pathway involved in antiplatelet action of scutellarein, and may be beneficial for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

26890534|t|Efficacy of MLC601 on functional recovery after stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
26890534|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) MLC601 has shown promising results on functional recovery of patients after stroke. This study aimed to evaluate the pooled effect of its efficacy. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy of MLC601 vs other TCM compounds or placebo. The pooled effect was the relative risk (RR) combined by random effects model. A prediction effect interval was estimated for new studies and a cumulative meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Four studies comprising five RCTs were included. The pooled RR was 1.64 (95% CI = 1.05-2.57; p-value = 0.031) favouring MLC601, but heterogeneity was large (I(2) = 80%; Q-test p-value = 0.0005). Therefore, the prediction interval was wide and consistent with a null effect (RR range = 0.36-7.45). The cumulative meta-analysis showed a decreasing pattern of effect size through time, with higher effects for trials comparing MLC601 vs other TCM and a systematic decrease of the pooled effect when including later trials comparing MLC601 vs placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the efficacy of MLC601 has decreased over time and when the comparison arm is placebo instead of other TCM compound. Current evidence suggests MLC601 does not outperform placebo on functional recovery after stroke.

26524137|t|Electro-acupuncture at LI11 and ST36 acupoints exerts neuroprotective effects via reactive astrocyte proliferation after ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats.
26524137|a|Reactive astrogliosis is a common phenomenon in central nervous system (CNS) injuries such as ischemic stroke. The present study aimed to deeply investigate the relationships between the neuroprotective effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) and reactive astrocytes following cerebral ischemia. EA treatment at the Quchi (LI11) and Zusanli (ST36) acupoints at Day 3 attenuated neurological deficits and cerebral infarct volume in ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injured rats. Animal behavior assessments found that the speed of Catwalk gait, equilibrium and coordination of Rotarod test were improved. Furthermore, EA treatment exerted neuroprotective effects via activation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin and nestin positive cells. Simultaneously, an obvious increase in GFAP/vimentin, GFAP/nestin and GFAP/BrdU co-labeling appeared in the peri-infract cortex and striatum, suggesting EA can promote the proliferation of GFAP/vimentin/nestin-positive reactive astrocytes. The expression of cell cycle-associated proteins Cyclin Dl, CDK4 and phospho-Rb were increased in the peri-infract cortex and striatum, indicating proliferated reactive astrocytes-mediated CyclinDl/CDK4 regulation of the transition of the G1-to-S cell cycle phases. In addition, EA enhanced the localized expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the peri-infract cortex and striatum. These results demonstrated that EA treatment at the LI11 and ST36 acupoints on Day 3 exerted neuroprotection via proliferation of GFAP/vimentin/nestin-positive reactive astrocytes and, potentially, secretion of reactive astrocytes-derived BDNF in I/R injured rats.

27898404|t|Prolonged Fasting Improves Endothelial Progenitor Cell-Mediated Ischemic Angiogenesis in Mice.
27898404|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Prolonged fasting (PF) was shown to be of great potency to promote optimal health and reduce the risk of many chronic diseases. This study sought to determine the effect of PF on the endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-mediated angiogenesis in the ischemic brain and cerebral ischemic injury in mice. METHODS: Mice were subjected to PF or periodic PF after cerebral ischemia, and histological analysis and behavioral tests were performed. Mouse EPCs were isolated and examined, and the effects of EPC transplantation on cerebral ischemic injury were investigated in mice. RESULTS: It was found that PF significantly increased the EPC functions and angiogenesis in the ischemic brain, and attenuated the cerebral ischemic injury in mice that was previously subjected to cerebral ischemia. Periodic PF might reduce cortical atrophy and improve long-term neurobehavioral outcomes after cerebral ischemia in mice. The eNOS and MnSOD expression and intracellular NO level were increased, and TSP-2 expression and intracellular O2- level were reduced in EPCs from PF-treated mice compared to control. In addition, transplanted EPCs might home into ischemic brain, and the EPCs from PF-treated mice had a stronger ability to promote angiogenesis in ischemic brain and reduce cerebral ischemic injury compared to the EPCs from control mice. The EPC-conditioned media from PF-treated mice exerted a stronger effect on cerebral ischemic injury reduction compared to that from control mice. CONCLUSION: Prolonged fasting promoted EPC-mediated ischemic angiogenesis and improved long-term stroke outcomes in mice. It is implied that prolonged fasting might potentially be an option to treat ischemic vascular diseases.

26497887|t|Melatonin as an Antioxidant for Stroke Neuroprotection.
26497887|a|Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone derived from the pineal gland that has a wide range of clinical applications. While melatonin was originally assessed as a hormone specializing in regulation of the normal circadian rhythm in mammals, it now has been shown to be an effective free radical scavenger and antioxidant. Current research has focused on central nervous system (CNS) disorders, stroke in particular, for potential melatonin-based therapeutics. As of now, the realm of potential therapy regimens is focused on three main treatments: exogenously delivered melatonin, pineal gland grafting, and melatonin-mediated stem cell therapy. All therapies contain both costs and benefits, and current research is still focused on finding the best treatment plan. While comprehensive research has been conducted, more research regarding the safety of such therapies is needed in order to transition into the clinical level of testing. Antioxidants such as traditional Chinese medicine, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and lavender oil, which have been used for thousands of years as treatment, are now gaining recognition as effective melatonin treatment alternatives. This review will further discuss relevant studies assessing melatonin-based therapeutics and provide evidence of other natural melatonin treatment alternatives for the treatment of stroke.

26415519|t|Vitamin D Supplementation in the Treatment of Chronic Heart Failure: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
26415519|a|BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been growing evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with the development and progression of chronic heart failure (CHF). HYPOTHESIS: Additional supplementation of vitamin D may have protective effects in patients with CHF. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases through June 2015 and included 7 randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CHF. Then, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials to confirm whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in CHF patients. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models. RESULTS: Our pooled results indicated that additional supplementation of vitamin D was not superior to conventional treatment in terms of left ventricular ejection fraction, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and 6-minute walk distance. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation was associated with significant decreases in the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (WMD: -2.42 pg/mL, 95% CI: -4.26 to -0.57, P < 0.05), C-reactive protein (WMD: -0.72 mg/L, 95% CI: -1.42 to -0.02, P < 0.05), and parathyroid hormone (WMD: -13.44 pg/mL, 95% CI: -21.22 to -5.67, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation may decrease serum levels of parathyroid hormone and inflammatory mediators in CHF patients, whereas it has no beneficial effects on improvement of left ventricular function and exercise tolerance.

27113744|t|Discovery of a Novel Anti-Cancer Agent Targeting Both Topoisomerase I & II as Well as Telomerase Activities in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma A549 Cells In Vitro and In Vivo: Cinnamomum verum Component Cuminaldehyde.
27113744|a|Cinnamomum verum is used to make the spice cinnamon and has been used for more than 5000 years by both of the two most ancient forms of medicine in the words: Ayurveda and traditional Chinese herbal medicines for various applications such as adenopathy, rheumatism, dermatosis, dyspepsia, stroke, tumors, elephantiasis, trichomonas, yeast, and virus infections. We evaluated the anticancer effect of cuminaldehyde (CuA), a constituent of the bark of the plant, and its underlying molecular biomarkers associated with carcinogenesis in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. The results show that cuminaldehyde suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis as indicated by mitochondrial membrane potential loss, activation of caspase 3 and 9, increase in annexin V+PI+ cells, and morphological characteristics of apoptosis, including blebbing of plasma membrane, nuclear condensation, fragmentation, apoptotic body formation, and comet with elevated tail intensity and moment. In addition, cuminaldehyde also induced lysosomal vacuolation with increased volume of acidic compartments (VAC), suppressions of both topoisomerase I & II as well as telomerase activities in a dose-dependent manner. Further study reveals the growth-inhibitory effect of cuminaldehyde was also evident in a nude mice model. Taken together, the data suggest that the growth-inhibitory effect of cuminaldehyde against A549 cells is accompanied by downregulations of proliferative control involving apoptosis, both topoisomerase I & II as well as telomerase activities, together with an upregulation of lysosomal vacuolation and VAC. Similar effects (including all of the above-mentioned effects) were found in other cell lines, including human lung squamous cell carcinoma NCI-H520 and colorectal adenocarcinoma COLO 205 (results not shown). Our data suggest that cuminaldehyde could be a potential agent for anticancer therapy.

26957269|t|Low level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is related with increased hemorrhagic transformation after acute ischemic cerebral infarction.
26957269|a|OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after acute ischemic infarction varies greatly. Risk factors of HT include ageing, severity of stroke, baseline hypertension, high NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, hyperglycemia and cardioembolic infarction and low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). We investigated the relationship between LDL, lipid profile and HT after acute ischemic infarction and suggested precautions for HT management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty-eight patients with acute infarction were included in the study. Fasting lipid profile was examined on the next morning following hospitalization. Either MRI GRE-T2*WI or CT was performed, one week after hospitalization to detect any cerebral microbleed (CMB) and hemorrhagic transformation. The lipid profiles examined included total cholesterol (TCH), triglyceride (TG), LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). RESULTS: Among all the patients, HT was noted in 35 patients and non-HT in 313. As compared with non-HT group, HT group had lower levels of TCH, HDL and LDL, lower rates of leukoaraiosis and CMB, but higher scores of NIHSS, higher rates of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and urokinase thrombolysis. The multivariate binary logistic regression showed that cardioembolic infarction, infarction with undetermined etiology, high scores of NIHSS and diabetes were the risk factors of HT, while the protective factor was LDL (OR=0.654, 95% CI: 0.430-0.996, p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Low level of LDL is likely associated with increased HT after acute ischemic infarct, so for those patients with low level of LDL, high scores of NIHSS and cardioembolic infarction at admission, aggressive lipid- lowering treatment should be prescribed cautiously to prevent the incidence of HT.

27703487|t|Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicines against Ischemic Injury in In Vivo Models of Cerebral Ischemia.
27703487|a|Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke. In the ischemic cascade, resident microglia are rapidly activated in the brain parenchyma and subsequently trigger inflammatory mediator release, which facilitates leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in inflammation. Activated leukocytes invade the endothelial cell junctions and destroy the blood-brain barrier integrity, leading to brain edema. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) stimulation in microglia/macrophages through the activation of intercellular signaling pathways secretes various proinflammatory cytokines and enzymes and then aggravates cerebral ischemic injury. The secreted cytokines activate the proinflammatory transcription factors, which subsequently regulate cytokine expression, leading to the amplification of the inflammatory response and exacerbation of the secondary brain injury. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), including TCM-derived active compounds, Chinese herbs, and TCM formulations, exert neuroprotective effects against inflammatory responses by downregulating the following: ischemia-induced microglial activation, microglia/macrophage-mediated cytokine production, proinflammatory enzyme production, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, matrix metalloproteinases, TLR expression, and deleterious transcription factor activation. TCMs also aid in upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokine expression and neuroprotective transcription factor activation in the ischemic lesion in the inflammatory cascade during the acute phase of cerebral ischemia. Thus, TCMs exert potent anti-inflammatory properties in ischemic stroke and warrant further investigation.

27630730|t|Oral Chinese Herbal Medicine for Treatment of Dilated Cardiomyopathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
27630730|a|Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the main causes of heart failure and could increase death, hospitalization, and rehospitalization rate. The effect of conventional medicine treatment (CMT) is limited; meanwhile, the combination of CMT and Oral Chinese Herbal Medicine (OCHM) represents exciting adjunctive therapies. In this study, we ascertained the therapeutic effect of OCHM in combination with CMT for dilated cardiomyopathy by using meta-analysis methods for controlled clinical trials. We searched studies from five databases and extracted data from these studies. We also assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We evaluated the following outcome measures to estimate the prognosis in patients with DCM: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), stroke volume (SV), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and overall efficacy. The result showed that OCHM combined with CMT for the improvement of therapeutic effect in DCM patients. However, the evidence remains weak due to the small sample size, high clinical heterogeneity, and poor methodological quality of the included trials. Further, large sample size and well-designed trials are needed.

27547231|t|An Overview of Systematic Reviews of Danhong Injection for Ischemic Stroke.
27547231|a|Objective. This overview is to evaluate the current evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) of Danhong injection (DHI) for ischemic stroke (IS). Methods. SRs of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning DHI and IS were searched in six databases without language restrictions until September 2015. Assessment of multiple systematic reviews (AMSTAR) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of all included SRs. Result. A total of 8 articles were included. After the administration of DHI, clinical efficiency and neurological deficits score have marked advantages over those of the control group. However, the overall poor quality of meta-analysis and original studies affected the reliability of the results. Evaluation of methodological quality found that no one paper meets the requirements of all 11 items. The main flaws of the methodology quality included the following: not providing "a priori" design and reasonable objectives, duplicate study selection not given enough attention, performing an incomprehensive literature search, not paying attention to publication bias and other bias reports, characteristics of included studies not provided in detail, and ignoring clinical heterogeneity when performing meta-analyses. Conclusion. The current published SRs suggest DHI appears to be a safe and effective way for IS treatment in general. However, it lacks a high quality systematic evaluation and analysis. The quality of SRs should be improved. Further large sample-size and well-designed RCTs are needed.

27123036|a|Naoxintong capsule (NXT) is a commercial medicinal product approved by the China Food and Drug Administration which is used in the treatment of stroke and coronary heart disease. However, the research on the composition and mechanism of NXT is still lacking. Our research aimed to identify the absorbable components, potential targets, and associated pathways of NXT with network pharmacology method. We explored the chemical compositions of NXT based on UPLC/Q-TOF-MS. Then, we used the five principles of drug absorption to identify absorbable ingredients. The databases of PharmMapper, Universal Protein, and the Molecule Annotation System were used to predict the main targets and related pathways. By the five principles of drug absorption as a judgment rule, we identified 63 compositions that could be absorbed in the blood in all 81 chemical compositions. Based on the constructed networks by the significant regulated 123 targets and 77 pathways, the main components that mediated the efficacy of NXT were organic acids, saponins, and tanshinones. Radix Astragali was the critical herbal medicine in NXT, which contained more active components than other herbs and regulated more targets and pathways. Our results showed that NXT had a therapeutic effect on heart diseases through the pattern "multiple components-multiple targets-multiple pathways."

27069496|t|Tongxinluo Enhances Neurogenesis and Angiogenesis in Peri-Infarct Area and Subventricular Zone and Promotes Functional Recovery after Focal Cerebral Ischemic Infarction in Hypertensive Rats.
27069496|a|Background. Tongxinluo is a traditional Chinese medicine compound with the potential to promote the neuronal functional recovery in cerebral ischemic infarction. Objective. This study aimed to disclose whether tongxinluo promotes neurological functional recovery and neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the infarcted area and SVZ after cerebral ischemic infarction in hypertensive rats. Methods. The ischemic model was prepared by distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in hypertensive rats. Tongxinluo was administrated 24 h after MCAO and lasted for 3, 7, or 14 days. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate the protection of tongxinluo. Immunochemical staining was applied on brain tissue to evaluate the effects of tongxinluo on neurogenesis and vascularization in the MCAO model rats. Results. Postinjury administration of tongxinluo ameliorated the neuronal function deficit in the MCAO model rats. As evidenced by the immunochemical staining, BrdU(+)/DCX(+), BrdU(+)/nestin(+), and BrdU(+) vascular endothelial cells were promoted to proliferate in SVZ after tongxinluo administration. The matured neurons stained by NeuN and vascularization by laminin staining were observed after tongxinluo administration in the peri-infarct area. Conclusion. Tongxinluo postischemia administration could ameliorate the neurological function deficit in the model rats. Possible mechanisms are related to neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the peri-infarct area and SVZ.

26366836|t|Efficacy and Safety of Mechanical Thrombectomy in Treating Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Meta Analysis.
26366836|a|OBJECTIVES: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a promising treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). But the results of completed trials were contradictory. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MT in treating AIS. METHODS: Literatures were searched in the databases including Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Ovid-SP. The bias and quality of publications with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed with the Cochrane collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. RESULTS: Totally 16 publications matched the inclusion criteria, including seven independent RCTs and 2043 AIS patients. The results showed that the recanalization rate and the modified Rankin score of 0-2 at 90 days after treatment were better in MT combining standard care group, but the mortality had no significant difference, even the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage during follow-up period was worse, as compared with standard care group. CONCLUSION: MT combining standard care would be an effective and promising treatment for AIS patients according to the present study.

26508684|t|Dysphagia Post Subcortical and Supratentorial Stroke.
26508684|a|BACKGROUND: Studies have recognized that the damage in the subcortical and supratentorial regions may affect voluntary and involuntary aspects of the swallowing function. The current study attempted to explore the dysphagia characteristics in patients with subcortical and supratentorial stroke. METHODS: Twelve post first or second subcortical and supratentorial stroke patients were included in the study. The location of the stroke was ascertained by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The characteristics of swallowing disorder were assessed by video fluoroscopic swallowing assessment/fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. The following main parameters were analyzed: oral transit time, pharyngeal delay time, presence of cricopharyngeal muscle achalasia (CMA), distance of laryngeal elevation, the amounts of vallecular residue and pyriform sinus residue (PSR), and the extent of pharyngeal contraction. RESULTS: Eighty-three percent of the 12 patients were found suffering from pharyngeal dysphagia, with 50% having 50%-100% PSRs, 50% having pharyngeal delay, and 41.6% cases demonstrating CMA. Simple regression analysis showed PSRs were most strongly associated with CMA. Pharyngeal delay in the study can be caused by infarcts of basal ganglia/thalamus, infarcts of sensory tract, infarcts of swallowing motor pathways in the centrum semiovale, or a combination of the three. CONCLUSION: Subcortical and supratentorial stroke may result in pharyngeal dysphagia such as PSR and pharyngeal delay. PSR was mainly caused by CMA.

26825910|t|Large HDL Subfraction But Not HDL-C Is Closely Linked With Risk Factors, Coronary Severity and Outcomes in a Cohort of Nontreated Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease: A Prospective Observational Study.
26825910|a|High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is highly heterogeneous in its size and composition. Till now, the link of HDL subfractions to coronary risk is less clear. We aimed to investigate the associations of HDL subfractions with traditional risk factors (RFs), coronary severity, and outcomes in a cohort of nontreated patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). We prospectively enrolled 591 eligible patients. Baseline HDL subfractions were separated by Lipoprint system. HDL subfractions (large, medium, and small) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were dichotomized into low and high group according to the 50 percentile. Coronary severity was evaluated by SYNTAX, Gensini, and Jeopardy scoring systems. Patients were followed up annually for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Cox proportional hazards' models were used to evaluate the risk of HDL subfractions on MACEs. Patients with high large HDL-C levels had a decreased number of RFs. Significantly, large HDL-C levels were negatively associated with coronary severity assessed by SYNTAX and Gensini score (both P < 0.05). New MACEs occurred in 67 (11.6%) patients during a median 17.0 months follow-up. Moreover, the log-rank test revealed that there was a significant difference between high and low large HDL-C groups in event-free survival analysis (P = 0.013), but no differences were observed in total HDL-C groups and medium or small HDL-C groups (both P > 0.05). In particular, the multivariate Cox-proportional hazards model revealed that high large HDL-C was associated with lower MACEs risk (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.531 [0.295-0.959]) independent of potential confounders. Higher large HDL-C but not medium, small, or total HDL-C is associated with lower cardiovascular risk, highlighting the potential beneficial of HDL subfractionation.

26817897|t|Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine Therapy and the Risk of Vascular Complications in Patients With Type II Diabetes Mellitus: A Nationwide, Retrospective, Taiwanese-Registry, Cohort Study.
26817897|a|With an increasing use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), evidence of long-term benefit with adjunctive TCM treatment is limited. This study investigated whether the concurrent TCM treatment reduces the risk of vascular complications in T2DM patients by using a large population from National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).We identified 33,457 adult patients with newly diagnosed T2DM using anti-diabetic agents from a random sample of one million beneficiaries in the NHIRD between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2011. We recruited 1049 TCM users (received TCM over 30 days with a diagnosis of T2DM) and randomly selected 4092 controls as the non-TCM cohort at a ratio of 1:4 frequency-matched by age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and index year. We investigated the prescription pattern of TCM and conducted a Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke, chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and diabetic foot between the 2 cohorts.In the TCM cohort, the prescription pattern of TCM was different between insulin and noninsulin patients. The most common herbs were Dan-Shen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae) in noninsulin group and Da-Huang (Radix et Rhizoma Rhei) in insulin group. The most common formulae were Liu-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan in noninsulin group and Yu-Quan-Wan in insulin group. Although no significant reduction in the hazard ratio of CKD and diabetic foot, the incidence rate of stroke was 7.19 per 1000 person-years in the TCM cohort and 10.66 per 1000 person-years in the control cohort, respectively. After adjustment of age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and antidiabetes agent use (including sulfonylureas, α-glucosidase, metformin, meglitinide, thiazolidinediones, and insulin), TCM cohorts were found to have a 33% decreased risk of stroke (95% CI = 0.46-0.97; P < 0.05).This population-based retrospective study showed that the complementary TCM therapy might associate with the decreased risk of stroke in T2DM, suggesting TCM as an adjunctive therapy for T2DM to prevent subsequent stroke.

26588440|t|Identification of key active constituents of Buchang Naoxintong capsules with therapeutic effects against ischemic stroke by using an integrative pharmacology-based approach.
26588440|a|Integrative pharmacology has been used to identify the key active constituents (KACs) of Buchang Naoxintong capsules (BNCs), a traditional Chinese medical preparation; this approach involves the evaluation of the content profiles and drug-like properties of the BNC constituents and development of an ingredient-target network. In this study, we used a sensitive analytical method to simultaneously identify and quantify 16 constituents of BNCs. Metabolism of these constituents by gut microbiota and human oral bioavailability were predicted using an in silico approach, followed by construction of networks to analyze the interactions between BNC constituents, their molecular targets, and proteins known to be the molecular targets for Food and Drug Administration-approved colitis medication. Finally, an animal model of ischemic stroke was used to verify the therapeutic effects of the KACs of BNCs. Amygdalin and paeoniflorin were identified as the KACs because they were the 2 most abundant BNC constituents, having appropriate drug-like properties, and produced therapeutic effects against cerebral ischemia. Amygdalin produced an anti-cerebral ischemia effect, likely by interacting with the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade C (antithrombin), member 1 (SERPINC1). These results form the basis for conducting studies to identify KACs in traditional medicinal preparations; such studies might improve quality control and allow the in vivo evaluation of synergistic interactions between the complex mixtures of compounds.

26974464|t|Soy Consumption with Risk of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.
26974464|a|BACKGROUND: The association of soy product consumption with the relative risk of cardiovascular disease remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed at investigating whether an association exists between soy consumption and the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) in observational studies. METHODS: A systematic search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed for case-control and cohort studies that assessed soy consumption and the risk of stroke and CHD. Summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95% CIs were combined by using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Of a total of 1,266 abstracts, 5 prospective cohort and 6 case-control studies met our inclusion criteria, and comprised 4,954 stroke and 7,616 CHD events. Based on the high vs. low analyses, combining cohort studies showed no association between soy intake and risk of stroke (SRR 0.92; 95% CI 0.70-1.10; Pheterogeneity = 0.236; I2 = 29.4%) or CHD (SRR 0.97; 95% CI 0.74-1.27; Pheterogeneity = 0.020; I2 = 62.7%), although a significantly inverse association between soy intake and the risk of stroke (SRR 0.54; 95% CI 0.34-0.87; Pheterogeneity = 0.001; I2 = 79.3%) and CHD (SRR 0.66; 95% CI 0.56-0.77; Pheterogeneity = 0.421; I2 = 0) was observed in case-control studies. No association between soy isoflavone intake and the risk of stroke and CHD was identified. CONCLUSION: There was limited evidence to indicate that soy consumption was inversely associated with the risk of stroke and CHD, although further studies, with prospective designs that use validated questionnaires and control for important confounders, are warranted.

27087890|t|YiQiFuMai Powder Injection Ameliorates Cerebral Ischemia by Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Neuronal Apoptosis.
27087890|a|YiQiFuMai (YQFM) powder injection as a modern preparation derived from Sheng Mai San, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, its neuroprotective effect and underlying mechanism in cerebral ischemia remain to be explored. The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of YQFM on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis in the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion- (MCAO-) injured mice and the oxygen-glucose deprivation- (OGD-) induced pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The results showed that single administration of YQFM (1.342 g/kg, i.p.) could reduce the brain infarction and improve the neurological deficits and the cerebral blood flow (CBF) after MCAO for 24 h in mice. Moreover, incubation with YQFM (100, 200, and 400 μg/mL) could increase the cell viability, decrease the caspase-3 activity, and inhibit the cell apoptosis in OGD-induced PC12 cells for 12 h. In addition, YQFM treatment could significantly modulate cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2 expressions and inhibit the expressions of ER stress-related marker proteins and signaling pathways in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence that YQFM ameliorates cerebral ischemic injury linked with modulating ER stress-related signaling pathways, which provided some new insights for its prevention and treatment of cerebral ischemia diseases.

26941888|t|NADPH Oxidase: A Potential Target for Treatment of Stroke.
26941888|a|Stroke is the third leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of stroke, and excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria is thought to be the main cause of oxidative stress. NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes have recently been identified and studied as important producers of ROS in brain tissues after stroke. Several reports have shown that knockout or deletion of NOX exerts a neuroprotective effect in three major experimental stroke models. Recent studies also confirmed that NOX inhibitors ameliorate brain injury and improve neurological outcome after stroke. However, the physiological and pathophysiological roles of NOX enzymes in the central nervous system (CNS) are not known well. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of our current understanding about expression and physiological function of NOX enzymes in the CNS and its pathophysiological roles in the three major types of stroke: ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

26986707|t|Predicting the prevalence of peripheral arterial diseases: modelling and validation in different cohorts.
26986707|a|BACKGROUND: To develop models for prevalence estimation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and to validate them in an external cohort. METHODS: Model training cohort was a population based cross-sectional survey. Age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), TC/HDL ratio, low density lipoprotein, fasting glucose, diabetes, hypertension, pulse pressure, and stroke history were considered candidate predicting variables. Ankle brachial index ≤ 0.9 was defined as the presence of peripheral arterial disease. Logistic regression method was used to build the prediction models. The likelihood ratio test was applied to select predicting variables. The bootstrap method was used for model internal validation. Model performance was validated in an external cohort. RESULTS: The final models included age, sex, pulse pressure, TC/HDL ratio, smoking status, diabetes, and stroke history. Area under receiver operating characteristics (AUC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the final model from the training cohort was 0.74 (0.70, 0.77). Model validation in another cohort revealed AUC (95% CI) of 0.72 (0.70, 0.73). P value of Hosmer-Lemeshow's model goodness of fit test was 0.75 indicating good model calibration. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model yielded a moderate usefulness for predicting the prevalence of PAD in general population.

26549268|t|Prescription patterns of traditional Chinese medicine for peptic ulcer disease in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study.
26549268|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Peptic ulcer disease is a common digestive disease. There is a lack of large-scale survey on the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of TCM for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a random sample comprised of one million individuals with newly diagnosed peptic ulcer disease between 2001 and 2010 from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Demographic characteristics and TCM usage, including Chinese herbal formulas and the single herbs prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 96,624 newly diagnosed subjects with peptic ulcer disease were included. 14,983 (15.5%) patients were TCM users. People residing in highly urbanized areas, younger people and female (compared with male) were more likely to use TCM. With regard to the comorbidities, TCM users had a lower prevalence of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis and stroke. The average time between onset of peptic ulcer disease and the first visit to a TCM clinic was 4.7 months. Majority of the patients (n=14,449; 96.4%) received only Chinese herbal remedies. The most frequently prescribed Chinese herbal formula and single herb was Ban-Xia-Xie-Xin-Tang (Pinelliae Decoction to Drain the Epigastrium) and Hai-Piao-Xiao (Os Sepiae), respectively. The core pattern analysis showed that combination of Ban-Xia-Xie-Xin-Tang, Hai-Piao-Xiao (Os Sepiae), Yan-Hu-Suo (Rhizoma Corydalis), Bei-Mu (Bulbus Fritillariae Thunbergii) and Chuan-Lian-Zi (Fructus Toosendan) was most frequently used for peptic ulcer disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified the core prescription patterns of TCM for patients with peptic ulcer disease in Taiwan. Further basic and clinical studies are necessary to elucidate the efficacy and mechanisms.

26700278|t|Design, methodology and baseline characteristics of Tai Chi and its protective effect against ischaemic stroke risk in an elderly community population with risk factors for ischaemic stroke: a randomised controlled trial.
26700278|a|INTRODUCTION: Controlling risk factors with regular exercise is effective and cost-effective for the primary prevention of ischaemic stroke. As a traditional Chinese form of exercise, Tai Chi might be beneficial in decreasing ischaemic stroke, but the evidence remains insufficient. We hypothesise that elderly community adults with risk factors for ischaemic stroke will decrease their ischaemic stroke risk by improving cerebral haemodynamic parameters, cardiopulmonary function, motor function, plasma risk indices, physical parameters or psychological outcomes after receiving 12 weeks of regular Tai Chi training compared with those who maintained their original physical activities. Therefore, we designed a randomised controlled trial that will systematically evaluate the protective effects of Tai Chi exercise on ischaemic stroke risk in an elderly community population with risk factors for ischaemic stroke. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A total of 170 eligible participants were randomly allocated into either the Tai Chi training group or the usual physical activity group. This paper reports on the design, intervention development and baseline characteristics of the participants. There were no significant differences between comparison groups in demographic characteristics or the baseline data of primary or secondary outcomes. Participants in the Tai Chi training group will receive 12 weeks of Tai Chi training with a frequency of 5 days/week and 60 min/day, while those in the usual physical activities group will maintain their original activities. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at the 12-week and 24-week follow-ups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of The Affiliated People's Hospital of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (number 2013-020-02). The findings of this study will be communicated to healthcare professionals, participants and the public through peer-reviewed publications or scientific conferences.

26654631|t|Evaluating the effects of Danhong injection in treatment of acute ischemic stroke: study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
26654631|a|BACKGROUND: Danhong injection (DHI) has been widely prescribed to patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, due to methodological deficiencies, previous research has not yet provided rigorous evidence to support the use of DHI in the treatment of AIS. Therefore, we designed this multicenter, randomized, controlled, and double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DHI for AIS. METHODS/DESIGN: It is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive clinical trial. A total of 864 eligible patients will be randomized into either the DHI or placebo group in a 2:1 ratio. All patients will be given the standard medical care as recommended by guidelines. Participants will undergo a 2-week treatment regimen and 76-day follow-up period. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome, defined as a score of 0-1 on the modified Rankin scale at day 90. Secondary outcomes include a change in the total score of the Chinese medicine symptom scales of "Xueyu Zheng" (blood stasis syndrome), the proportion of patients with a Barthel Index score of ≥90, the proportion of patients with an improvement in NIHSS score of ≥4 or NIHSS score of 0-1, quality of life measured by the EQ-5D scale, etc. Safety outcomes such as global disability (mRS ≥3) at day 90 will also be assessed. The changes in mRNA and microRNA profiles in 96 patients selected from certain centers will also be assessed. As this is an adaptive design, two interim analyses are prospectively planned, which will be carried out after one-third and two-thirds of patients have completed the trial, respectively. Based on the results of the interim analyses, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will decide how to modify the study. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide high-quality evidence for DHI in treatment of AIS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov NCT01677208 (Date of registration 22 December 2012).

METHODS: The focal cerebral I/R model was established by intraluminal thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). The animals were divided into sham operation group (sham group) and I/R group. The infarct area of the brain was measured by 2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining technique after 1 week. Protein expression levels of Notch3 and Frizzled2 in the cortex of frontal and parietal lobes were detected by immunohistochemical staining, and protein expression levels of Notch4 and Tead1 were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The infarct area of rats in I/R group was very obvious. The protein expressions of Notch3 and Frizzled2 in I/R group were higher than those in sham group (P<0.05, P<0.01). The protein expression of Notch4 in I/R group was significantly higher than that in sham group (P<0.01), but the protein expression level of Tead1 in I/R group was significantly lower than that in sham group(P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Notch signal transduction pathway was activated after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in MCAO rats.

26631161|t|Effects of acupuncture and computer-assisted cognitive training for post-stroke attention deficits: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
26631161|a|BACKGROUND: A majority of stroke survivors present with cognitive impairments. Attention disturbance, which leads to impaired concentration and overall reduced cognitive functions, is strongly associated with stroke. The clinical efficacy of acupuncture with Baihui (GV20) and Shenting (GV24) as well as computer-assisted cognitive training in stroke and post-stroke cognitive impairment have both been demonstrated in previous studies. To date, no systematic comparison of these exists and the potential beneficial effects of a combined application are yet to be examined. The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of computer-assisted cognitive training compared to acupuncture on the outcomes of attention assessments. The second objective is to test the effects of a combined cognitive intervention that incorporates computer-assisted cognitive training and acupuncture (ACoTrain). METHODS/DESIGN: An international multicentre, single-blinded, randomised controlled pilot trial will be conducted. In a 1:1:1 ratio, 60 inpatients with post-stroke cognitive dysfunction will be randomly allocated into either the acupuncture group, the computer-assisted cognitive training group, or the ACoTrain group in addition to their individual rehabilitation programme. The intervention period of this pilot trial will last 4 weeks (30 minutes per day, 5 days per week, Monday to Friday). The primary outcome is the test battery for attentional performance. The secondary outcomes include the Trail Making Test, Test des Deux Barrages, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and Modified Barthel Index for assessment of daily life competence, and the EuroQol Questionnaire for health-related quality of life. DISCUSSION: This trial mainly focuses on evaluating the effects of computer-assisted cognitive training compared to acupuncture on the outcomes of attention assessments. The results of this pilot trial are expected to provide new insights on how Eastern and Western medicine can complement one another and improve the treatment of cognitive impairments in early stroke rehabilitation. Including patients with different cultural backgrounds allows a more generalisable interpretation of the results but also poses risks of performance bias. Using standardised and well-described assessments, validated for each region, is pivotal to allow pooling of the data. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trails.gov ID: NCT02324959 (8 December 2014).

26376847|t|Electroacupuncture ameliorates cognitive impairment and regulates the expression of apoptosis-related genes Bcl-2 and Bax in rats with cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury.
26376847|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke cognitive impairment seriously affects the quality of life and functional rehabilitation of patients with stroke. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) at GV20 and GV24 on cognitive impairment and apoptosis including expression of apoptosis-related genes Bcl-2 and Bax in a rat model of cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: Thirty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to a sham operation control group (SC group, n=10) or underwent surgery and MCAO (n=25). Postoperatively the latter group was randomly subdivided into EA or untreated (IR) groups. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM). Apoptosis was examined by detection of Bcl-2 and Bax expression in the cerebral cortex. RESULTS: The EA group had significantly decreased neurological deficit scores compared to the IR group (p<0.05). In the MWM test, significant differences in escape latency and route were observed between the EA and IR groups (p<0.05). Rats in the EA group performed better in the probe trial than those in the IR group (p<0.05). EA treatment markedly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells compared to the IR group (20.13±4.30% vs 38.40±3.38%; p<0.001). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results showed the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was significantly increased in the EA group compared to the IR group (1.61±0.19 vs 0.50±0.05, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that EA ameliorates cognitive impairment of rats with IR injury by modulating Bcl-2 and Bax expression.

26383034|t|Traditional Chinese Acupuncture for Poststroke Depression: A Single-Blind Double-Simulated Randomized Controlled Trial.
26383034|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and possible side-effect of treating poststroke depression patients by traditional Chinese body acupuncture. DESIGN: Single-blind double-simulated randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Inpatient wards of neurology and rehabilitation departments. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight (68) participants who met the criteria were randomly assigned into two groups, 34 cases (32 completed) into intervention group and 34 cases (33 completed) into control group. INTERVENTIONS: Body acupuncture (Shuigou GV 26, Neiguan PC 6, and Zusanli ST 36) and oral placebo were used in intervention group while fluoxetine and minimal nontraditional acupuncture (minimally active penetrating) were used in control group. Patients in both groups were treated separately once a day for 6 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), and side-effects were measured using the Side Effect Rating Scale (SERS) of Asberg and a self-designed needling adverse events scale. Clinical effects of both groups were statistically valued before treatment, week-2, week-6, and month-3. RESULTS: The total curative effects of both groups are similar (p > 0.05; evaluated in week-6 and month-3), while intervention group had an earlier onset time at week-2 (p < 0.05). The intervention group has fewer side-effects in week-2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Body acupuncture was effective in reducing stroke patients' depressive symptoms and had fewer side-effects. It should be considered as an option for neuropsychiatric sequelae of stroke.

26889189|t|Acupuncture for ischemic stroke: cerebellar activation may be a central mechanism following Deqi.
26889189|a|The needling sensation of Deqi during acupuncture is a key factor of influencing acupuncture outcome. Recent studies have mainly focused on the brain function effects of Deqi in a physiological state. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on the effects of acupuncture at Waiguan (SJ5) in pathological and physiological states is controversial. In this study, 12 patients with ischemic stroke received acupuncture at Waiguan (SJ5) and simultaneously underwent fMRI scanning of the brain, with imaging data of the activated areas obtained. Based on the patient's sensation, imaging data were allocated to either the Deqi group or non-Deqi group. In the Deqi group, the activated/deactivated areas were the left superior temporal gyrus (BA39)/right anterior lobe of the cerebellum and left thalamus. In the non-Deqi group, the activated areas included the medial frontal gyrus of the right frontal lobe (BA11), right limbic lobe (BA30, 35), and left frontal lobe (BA47), while the only deactivated area was the right parietal lobe (BA40). Compared with the non-Deqi group, the Deqi group exhibited marked activation of the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum and right limbic lobe (BA30). These findings confirm that the clinical effect of Deqi during acupuncture is based on brain functional changes. Cerebellar activation may be one of the central mechanisms of acupuncture in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

26889188|t|Neuroprotective effects of salidroside on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury involve the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway.
26889188|a|Salidroside, the main active ingredient extracted from Rhodiola crenulata, has been shown to be neuroprotective in ischemic cerebral injury, but the underlying mechanism for this neuroprotection is poorly understood. In the current study, the neuroprotective effect of salidroside on cerebral ischemia-induced oxidative stress and the role of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway was investigated in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Salidroside (30 mg/kg) reduced infarct size, improved neurological function and histological changes, increased activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase, and reduced malon-dialdehyde levels after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, salidroside apparently increased Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 expression. These results suggest that salidroside exerts its neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia through anti-oxidant mechanisms and that activation of the Nrf2 pathway is involved. The Nrf2/antioxidant response element pathway may become a new therapeutic target for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

26621314|t|System-wide assembly of pathways and modules hierarchically reveal metabolic mechanism of cerebral ischemia.
26621314|a|The relationship between cerebral ischemia and metabolic disorders is poorly understood, which is partly due to the lack of comparative fusing data for larger complete systems and to the complexity of metabolic cascade reactions. Based on the fusing maps of comprehensive serum metabolome, fatty acid and amino acid profiling, we identified 35 potential metabolic biomarkers for ischemic stroke. Our analyses revealed 8 significantly altered pathways by MetPA (Metabolomics Pathway Analysis, impact score >0.10) and 15 significantly rewired modules in a complex ischemic network using the Markov clustering (MCL) method; all of these pathways became more homologous as the number of overlapping nodes was increased. We then detected 24 extensive pathways based on the total modular nodes from the network analysis, 12 of which were new discovery pathways. We provided a new perspective from the viewpoint of abnormal metabolites for the overall study of ischemic stroke as well as a new method to simplify the network analysis by selecting the more closely connected edges and nodes to build a module map of stroke.

26887215|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the regularities and features of clinical application of simplex reinforcing or reducing manipulation of filiform acupuncture needles by data mining in order to guide clinical decision in a better way. METHODS: A database about simplex reinforcing and reducing manipulations of filiform acupuncture needle was established first after collection, sorting, screening, type-in, and collation of the related papers, academic dissertations and theses of academic conferences published from January 1st of 1950 to January 31 of 2015 by using key word "acupuncture" "acupuncture and moxibustion" "needle manipulation" and "filiform needle" from database of China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, a full-text database of Chinese journals), followed by data extraction and statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1 304 articles were found to meet the standards formulated in the present study. Among them, 800 papers belong to the internal medicine covering apoplectic sequelae (153 papers), apoplexy (52), headache (63) and insomnia (60), 271 to surgery involving soft tissue injury (63) and backleg pain (46); 93 to five-sense-organs involving nasosinusitis (14), 64 gynecology involving dysmenorrhea (13), 41 to dematology involving struma (20), and 35 to pediatrics covering five kinds of tardy growth and five flaccid syndromes(8). These 1 304 papers contain 2 542 of simplex reinforcing and reducing manipulations, including 895 of twirling-thrusting reducing, 611 of twirling-rotating reinforcing, 571 of lifting-thrusting reducing, 303 of lifting-thrusting reinforcing, 32 of reinforcing and 32 of reducing in cooperation wihpatients' respiration, 23 open-close reducing, 12 open-close reinforcing, 21 reducing and 16 of reinforcing achieved by inserting the needle along or against the meridian, 14 rapid-slow reinforcing, and 12 rapid-slow reducing. Regarding the acupoint selection, distal and local acupoints are most frequently used, followed by symptoms-determined and syndrome-determined, respectively. The acupuncture needle retained time was from 0 min to 45 mn, and the therapeutic effect was relatively better for post-stroke. The totally therapeutic effects of the simplex reinforcing and reducing manipulations were 96.07% for problems of demotology, 94.19% for gynecology, 96. 58% for surgery, 92.85% for pediatrics, 91.78% for five-sense organs and 93. 70% for internal medicine, respectively. CONCLUSION: Simplex reinforcing and reducing manipulations of acupuncture has a definite effect in the treatment of different problems particularly in the internal medicine and surgery. Often, the twirling-rotating and lifting-thrusting reinforcing and reducing manipulations of acupuncture are employed in clinical practice.

27245023|t|[Complex network analysis on dynamic change regularity of combining use of Chinese and western medicine in 27,678 cases with ischemic stroke in acute phase].
27245023|a|The acute phase of ischemic stroke patients are often treated with both Chinese patent medicine:and western medicine therapies in clinical practice. This research included 27,678 cases of the acute phase of ischemic stroke came from 14 3A level hospitals. We collected data from patients with ischemic stroke who used both Chinese patent medicine and western medicine and were hopitalized within 14 days from hospital information system (HIS). Constructing complex network of Chinese patent medicine and western medicine were found to show scale-free network. Hierarchical structure of the core algorithm was used to analyze the characteristics of combined core Chinese patent medicine and western medicine in admission condition of "acute", "critically", and "general" of ischemic stroke acute phase patient within one day, 2-3 days, 4-7 days and 8-14 days. We found that the core Chinese patent medicine mainly used for activate blood and resolve stasis medicine, and phlegm eliminating brain refreshing medicine in all kinds of patients, but the phlegm eliminating brain refreshing medicine were used to reduce with time elapsing. The core western medicine mainly used for anti-platelet medicine, improve circulation medicine, neuroprotective medicine, anticoagulants medicine and dehydration medicine. The dehydration medicine as the core western medicine for critically patients within 14 days, but the patients for general admission as core western medicine within 3 days. The neuroprotective medicine was used to decreases after 7 days in hospital. Combination of Chinese patent medicine and western medicine were mainly for neuroprotective medicine + activate blood and resolve stasis medicine, and anti-platelet medicine + activate blood and resolve stasis medicine, and improve circulation medicine + activate blood and resolve stasis medicine. The phlegm eliminating brain refreshing medicine was mainly combined with neuroprotective medicine by urgent and general admission condition patients, and it was more combined with dehydration medicine by critically admission condition patients. This research found that the dynamic characteristics for the combination of Chinese patent medicine and western medicine of acute phase of ischemic stroke patients by big data analytics and complex networks modeling, and provide basis for acute phase of ischemic stroke patients, it provide basis for ischemic stroke treatment strategy making.

26572875|t|A new prognostic scale for the early prediction of ischemic stroke recovery mainly based on traditional Chinese medicine symptoms and NIHSS score: a retrospective cohort study.
26572875|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a common disease, often resulting in death or disability. Previous studies on prognosis of stroke mainly focused on the baseline condition or modern expensive tests. However, the change of clinical symptoms during acute stage is considerably neglected. In our study, we aim to develop a new prognostic scale to predict the 90-day outcome of IS patients. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a secondary data analysis was performed on 489 patients extracted from 1046 patients of 4 hospitals. A new prognostic scale was constructed to predict the recovery of IS mainly based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) symptoms & signs and the changes during the first 3 days of patients in the 3 TCM hospitals. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the cutoff point for prediction. In the end, the scale was used to test the outcome of IS patients in Xuanwu hospital. RESULTS: The new prognostic scale was composed of 8 items including age degree (OR = 3.32; 95 % CI: 1.72-6.42), history of diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR = 2.20; 95 % CI: 1.19-4.08), NIHSS score (OR = 3.08; 95 % CI: 2.16-4.40), anxiety (OR = 3.17; 95 % CI: 1.90-5.29) and irritability (OR = 4.61; 95 % CI: 1.36-15.63) on the 1st day of illness onset, change in NIHSS score (OR = 2.49; 95 % CI: 1.31-4.73), and circumrotating (OR = 7.80; 95 % CI: 1.98-30.64) and tinnitus (OR = 13.25; 95 % CI: 1.55-113.34) during the first 3 days of stroke onset. The total score of the scale was 16.5 and the cutoff point was 9.5, which means patients would have poor outcome at 90 days of stroke onset if the score was higher than 9.5. The new scale was validated on the data of Xuanwu hospital, and the value of its sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy were 69.6 %, 83.3 % and 75.0 % respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 8-item scale, mainly based on TCM symptoms, NIHSS score and their changes during the first 3 days, can predict the 90-day outcome for IS patients while it still needs to be further validated and optimized clinically.

26560971|t|GRADE in Systematic Reviews of Acupuncture for Stroke Rehabilitation: Recommendations based on High-Quality Evidence.
26560971|a|Systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated acupuncture's effectiveness in stroke rehabilitation. The current study reviews the quality of evidence in SRs of acupuncture in stroke rehabilitation, and rates the strength of recommendation for its use based on this evidence using the GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations) approach. A comprehensive literature search was performed using multiple databases (e.g., Medline, Embase) with advanced search strategies. Two authors independently selected articles, collected data, and assessed the methodological quality of each identified SR according to AMSTAR (a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews) and OQAQ (Oxman and Guyatt's overview quality assessment questionnaire). Outcomes related to stroke rehabilitation were evaluated. SRs of high methodological quality (AMSTAR score ≥9 and OQAQ score ≥7) were graded using GRADE. Ultimately, acupuncture yields benefits in stroke rehabilitation (neurological function improvement: RR = 1.34; swallowing improvement: RR = 1.61, 1.49, 1.07; disability: SMD = 0.49 or 0.07). Poor evidentiary quality and insufficient information about harm led to weak recommendations. In conclusion, acupuncture may improve stroke rehabilitation, as the GRADE approach indicated a weak recommendation for acupuncture's usage in this context.

26329606|t|Electro-acupuncture exerts beneficial effects against cerebral ischemia and promotes the proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the cortical peri-infarct area through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
26329606|a|Electro-acupuncture (EA) is a novel therapy based on combining traditional acupuncture with modern electrotherapy, and it is currently being investigated as a treatment for ischemic stroke. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms through which EA regulates the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the cortical peri‑infarct area after stroke. The neuroprotective effects of EA on ischemic rats were evaluated by determining the neurological deficit scores and cerebral infarct volumes. The proliferation of the NPCs and the activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway in the cortical peri‑infarct area were examined. Our results revealed that EA significantly alleviated neurological deficits, reduced the infarct volume and enhanced NPC proliferation [nestin/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)‑double positive] in the cortex of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Moreover, the Wnt1 and β‑catenin mRNA and protein levels were increased, while glycogen synthase kinase‑3 (GSK3) transcription was suppressed by EA. These results suggest that the upregulatory effects of EA on the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway may promote NPC proliferation in the cortical peri-infarct area after stroke, consequently providing a therapeutic effect against cerebral ischemia.

26344870|t|The Prevalence and Determinants of Using Traditional Chinese Medicine Among Middle-aged and Older Chinese Adults: Results From the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study.
26344870|a|BACKGROUND: Although traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is known as an integrative part of China's health care system, little is known on the prevalence and determinants of using TCM among the middle-aged and older Chinese population, especially among those with chronic conditions. METHODS: The nationwide survey data of 17,708 Chinese adults aged 45 and older from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study were used to estimate the prevalence of TCM. SAS SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure was applied to identify factors associated with using TCM. Analysis took into account the complex survey design and nonresponse rate. RESULTS: The prevalence of using TCM was 19.3% (95% CI 18.4%-20.1%) among the overall participants and 24.5% (95% CI 23.4%-25.5%) among those with self-reported chronic conditions. Participants with stroke, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney diseases were the most frequent users of TCM to treat their conditions. Age, individual income, and family income were associated with TCM use; however, when further controlling for chronic diseases, these variables became nonsignificant. Besides TCM, 4.4% (3.8%-5.0%) and 4.6% (4.0%-5.2%) of the overall participants and those with chronic conditions, respectively, used other forms of complementary and alternative medicine. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of using TCM was high among the middle-aged and older Chinese population. The use of TCM was mainly driven by chronic conditions. The main conditions that patients used TCM to treat were stroke, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.

25940508|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increased cerebral blood flow velocity of basilar artery (BA) is common but often neglected. By using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to detect intracranial large artery stenosis, we performed transcranial Doppler (TCD) to evaluate cerebral hemodynamic changes of stroke patients. METHODS: Acute stroke patients with TCD-detected raised peak systolic velocity (PSV) in BA (≥100 cm/second) were recruited. RESULTS: Among 91 recruited patients, BA stenosis (>50%) was confirmed by using DSA in 29 patients (32%), among which 20 patients (70.0%) had coexistent internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA) stenoses. Among patients without BA stenosis (n = 62, 68%), severe stenosis or occlusion of ICA was evaluated in 22 patients (22/62, 35.4%) and severe stenosis or occlusion of VA was detected in 22 patients (22/62, 35.4%). Among the values of PSV (120, 140, 160, and 180 cm/second) and the stenotic-to-prestenotic ratio (SPR) (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0), 160 cm/second was found to show the highest predictive value (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve: .75, 95% CI: .65-.86), with a sensitivity of .70 and a specificity of .81. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from an intrinsic BA stenosis, high-grade steno-occlusion of ICA or VA may contribute a lot to induce an elevated flow velocity in BA. A higher value of cutoff point may increase the accuracy of diagnosing BA stenosis.

25821139|t|Positive effects of the traditional Chinese medicine MLC901 in cognitive tasks.
25821139|a|MLC901 (NurAiDII) is used as a treatment for stroke patients. It has been shown that MLC901 improves motor and cognitive recovery in ischemic and traumatic brain-injured rodents. The present study seeks to delineate cognitive effects induced by MLC901 in normal, noninjured mice. To this end, the behaviors of vehicle- and MLC901-treated C57BL/6 mice in hippocampus-dependent (passive avoidance, Morris water maze) and hippocampus-independent (novel object recognition) cognitive tasks are compared. The potential influence of the compound on the anxiety level and nycthemeral rhythm of mice is also assessed. In addition, the long-term effects of MLC901 on hippocampal neurogenesis are measured. The results clearly demonstrate that MLC901 promotes extinction in passive avoidance and reversal learning in the Morris water maze and improves the performance of mice in novel object recognition. In parallel, this study shows the long-term proneurogenesis effects of MLC901 that result in the increase in the number of mature neurons in the hippocampus. If these observations can be extended to humans, then MLC901 could represent a promising therapeutic strategy.

26449858|t|Approach based on high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint coupled with multivariate statistical analysis for the quality evaluation of Gastrodia Rhizoma.
26449858|a|Gastrodia Rhizoma is a Traditional Chinese Medicine applied in the treatment of stroke, numbness of limb, headache and dizziness. However, its clinical effect is threatened by sulfur-fumigation used in the process of storage. This article employs content determination coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint to investigate the effect of sulfur-fumigation on Gastrodia Rhizoma so as to evaluate the quality of Gastrodia Rhizoma. The result was that most active ingredient in Gastrodia Rhizoma decreased after sulfur-fumigation and the fingerprints analyzed by mathematical statistics between sulfur-fumigated Gastrodia Rhizoma and unfumigated Gastrodia Rhizoma have substantial differences, which reveals that sulfur-fumigation has a significant influence on the quality of Gastrodia Rhizoma. The conclusion of hierarchical clustering analysis, principal component analysis and partial least squares could validate each other, which implies that the method of mathematical statistics applied for assessing the quality of Gastrodia Rhizoma is effective and stable. The method not only affords a viable strategy for distinguishing Gastrodia Rhizoma whether sulfur-fumigated or not and assessment of the quality of Gastrodia Rhizoma, but also provides a reference for other herbal medicine that suffers from sulfur-fumigation.

26397995|t|Electroacupuncture ameliorates learning and memory in rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and promoting p-CREB expression in the hippocampus.
26397995|a|The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which electroacupuncture (EA) ameliorates learning and memory in rats with cerebral ischemic‑reperfusion (I/R) injury. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in adult male Sprague‑Dawley (SD) rats by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Following MCAO surgery, the rats received EA at the Shenting (DU24) and Baihui (DU20) acupoints. The results of the present study demonstrated that treatment with EA significantly ameliorated neurological deficits and reduced cerebral infarct volume (P<0.05). In addition, EA improved the learning and memory ability of the rats, and markedly activated the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element‑binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway, resulting in the inhibition of cerebral cell apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra. Furthermore, EA increased the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, the protein expression levels of phosphorylated‑CREB and B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2), and the mRNA expression levels of Bcl‑2. Conversely, EA decreased the levels of malondialdehyde and inhibited the expression levels of Bcl2‑associated X protein. The results of the present study suggest that treatment with EA may result in the amelioration of learning and memory ability in rats with cerebral I/R injury.

26116440|t|Suppression of mitochondrial fission in experimental cerebral ischemia: The potential neuroprotective target of p38 MAPK inhibition.
26116440|a|In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of p38 inhibition on experimental stroke in rats. p38 inhibition treatment alleviated the brain infarction volume and neurological deficits following ischemia, promoted the activation of Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), suppressed the activation of Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3b). Application of two p38 inhibitors, both SB239063 and Losmapimod could down-regulate DLP1 and MFF, which were involved in mitochondrial fission and fragmentation. Losmapimod application progressively suppressed DLP1/MFF from 6 h to 24 h after ischemia-reperfusion injury. SB239063 pretreatment further showed the suppression of DLP1/MFF, and up-regulated the protein levels of p62 and Mitochondrial Complex I at 5 mg/kg dose. Our results suggested that inhibition of p38 MAPK attenuated mitochondrial fragmentation/mitophagy after ischemic attack. In conclusion, p38 inhibition treatment might promote cellular survival signaling pathways, attenuate mitochondrial autophagy to maintain mitochondrial contents. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective target of p38 inhibition via suppressing mitochondrial fragmentation/mitophagy in cerebral ischemic injury.

26441223|t|Rhynchophylline Protects Against the Amyloid β-Induced Increase of Spontaneous Discharges in the Hippocampal CA1 Region of Rats.
26441223|a|Accumulated soluble amyloid β (Aβ)-induced aberrant neuronal network activity has been recognized as a key causative factor leading to cognitive deficits which are the most outstanding characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As an important structure associated with learning and memory, the hippocampus is one of the brain regions that are impaired very early in AD, and the hippocampal CA1 region is selectively vulnerable to soluble Aβ oligomers. Our recent study showed that soluble Aβ1-42 oligomers induced hyperactivity and perturbed the firing patterns in hippocampal neurons. Rhynchophylline (RIN) is an important active tetracyclic oxindole alkaloid isolated from Uncaria rhynchophylla which is a traditional Chinese medicine and often used to treat central nervous system illnesses such as hypertension, convulsions, tremor, stroke etc. Previous evidence showed that RIN possessed neuroprotective effects of improving the cognitive function of mice with Alzheimer-like symptoms. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of RIN against soluble Aβ1-42 oligomers-induced hippocampal hyperactivity. The results showed that (1) the mean frequency of spontaneous discharge was increased by the local application of 3 μM soluble Aβ1-42 oligomers; (2) 30 μM RIN did not exert any obvious effects on basal physiological discharges; and (3) treatment with RIN effectively inhibited the soluble Aβ1-42 oligomers-induced enhancement of spontaneous discharge, in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 = 9.0 μM. These in vivo electrophysiological results indicate that RIN can remold the spontaneous discharges disturbed by Aβ and counteract the deleterious effect of Aβ1-42 on neural circuit. The experimental findings provide further evidence to affirm the potential of RIN as a worthy candidate for further development into a therapeutic agent for AD.

26444387|t|Atopic Diseases and Subsequent Ischemic Stroke Among Patients With Schizophrenia: A Nationwide Longitudinal Study.
26444387|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation plays an important role in schizophrenia and atopic diseases, and studies have suggested that chronic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of stroke. The role of atopic diseases in the development of stroke among patients with schizophrenia is still unknown. METHODS: A total of 63,913 patients with schizophrenia without a stroke history between 2002 and 2008 and 63,913 age- and sex-matched controls were included and followed up to the end of 2011. Patients with schizophrenia and the reference group were divided into subgroups based on the presence or absence of atopic diseases. Individuals who developed stroke during follow-up were identified. RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia had an increased risk of developing ischemic stroke (no atopic disease: hazard ratio [HR] = 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.88-2.53; with atopic disease: HR = 3.11, 95% CI = 2.63-3.69) compared with the reference group without atopic diseases. Among patients with schizophrenia, the presence of atopic diseases increased the risk of developing ischemic stroke (HR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.24-1.66), with a cumulative relationship between greater numbers of atopic comorbidities and a greater risk of ischemic stroke (one atopic disease: HR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.19-1.63; two atopic comorbidities: HR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.10-2.00; at least 3 atopic comorbidities: HR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.55-5.12). CONCLUSIONS: The combined presence of schizophrenia and atopic diseases is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in later life compared with individuals without these conditions.

26822042|t|[Thrombus length evaluated by CT perfusion imaging and its value in prediction of recanalization after intravenous thrombolysis therapy].
26822042|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the thrombus length on CT perfusion imaging and to assess its predictive value for recanalization and clinical outcome after intravenous thrombolysis therapy (IVT). METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients with proximal middle cerebral artery (M1 segment) occlusion underwent CT perfusion imaging examination before IVT between June 2009 and May 2015. The onset-to needle time was (214.3 ± 82.0) min, and the pretreatment NIHSS score of patients was 13 (IQR 8-17). The thrombus length was determined as the distance between the proximal and distal thrombus end delineated on dynamic angiography, which was reconstructed from CT perfusion source images. Recanalization was evaluated according to Arterial Occlusive Lesion (AOL) scale, and functional outcome was based on modified Rankin scale (mRS) 3 months after IVT. Logistic regression model was used to investigate the relationship between thrombus length and recanalization, and the optimal cut-off points were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). RESULTS: Among 56 patients, 42 (75%) achieved recanalization 24 h after IVT with mean thrombus length of (9.0 ± 4.7) mm; and 14 (25%) patients remained occlusion with mean thrombus length of (10.0 ± 5.4) mm. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that thrombus length was an independent predictor for both recanalization (OR=0.869; 95% CI:0.764-0.987; P=0.031) and unfavorable outcome (OR=1.180;95% CI:1.023-1.362; P=0.023). Thrombus length of 11.3 mm was identified as the optimal cut-off value for recanalization (AUC=0.697, sensitivity 71.4%, specificity 76.2%), while thrombus length of 9.9 mm was the optimal cut-off value for unfavorable functional outcome (AUC=0.689, sensitivity 64.7%, specificity 71.4%). CONCLUSION: The thrombus length evaluated on CT perfusion imaging is an effective predictor for recanalization and unfavorable outcome after IVT in acute ischemic stroke patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion.

26775478|t|[Treatment of Chronic Heart Failure with Carotid Plaque Patients by Yiqi Huoxue Tongyang Xezhuo Recipe].
26775478|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of Yiqi Huoxue Tongyang Xiezhuo Recipe (YHTXR, capable of supplementing qi, activating blood, warming yang, and discharge turbidity) in treating coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAHD). and chronic heart failure (CHF) with carotid plaque patients, and to explore new ways of Chinese medicine (CM). METHODS: Totally 69 CAHD-CHF patients of qi deficiency phlegm stasis syndrome (QDPSS) with carotid plaque were recruited in this study using parallel cohort method. They were assigned to the treatment group (35 cases) and the control group (34 cases). Patients in the control group received routine treatment of Western medicine, while those in the treatment group were additionally treated with YHTXR (twice daily). The therapeutic course for all was three months. Cardiac function levels, echocardiography, carotid plaque, blood lipids and safety indicators were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment the improvement of cardiac function levels was better in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Decreased LDL-C levels were higher in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.01). There was statistical difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), LDL-C, TC, TG in the treatment group between before and after treatment (P < 0.05). LDL-C and TG also decreased in the control group after treatment (P <0.05). There was no significant difference in the left ventricular ejection fraction, carotid IMT, or TC in the control group between before and after treatment (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in stroke volume, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, the area of carotid artery plaque, or HDL-C in the two groups between before and after treatment (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YHTXR could effectively improve cardiac functions of CAHD-CHF patients of QDPSS with carotid plaque, reduce blood lipids and IMT. It had no significant adverse reactions for elderly patients in short term.

27071272|t|[Mechanism of "treating heart and brain with same methods" based on data science].
27071272|a|The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory of "treating heart and brain diseases with same methods (Nao Xin Tong Zhi: NXTZ)" has great significance to the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. It has been proven effective by a great deal of clinical researches. However, the underlying mechanism for this theory is still unclear. To provide insights into the potential mechanism of "NXTZ", this study attempts to deeply investigate the mechanism from two representative cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebral apoplexy. First, various data resources were integrated to obtain different types of biomedical entities including drugs, targets, pathways and diseases. Then, three different approaches including text mining, biological network and enrichment analysis were utilized to recognize the potential common features between CHD and cerebral apoplexy, and the corresponding functions of drugs which could treat both diseases, thus unveiling the mechanism of NXTZ.

26579046|t|Mirror neuron system based therapy for aphasia rehabilitation.
26579046|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of hand action observation training, i.e., mirror neuron system (MNS) based training, on language function of aphasic patients after stroke. In addition, to reveal the tentative mechanism underlying this effect. METHODS: Six aphasic patients after stroke, meeting the criteria, undergo 3 weeks' training protocol (30 min per day, 6 days per week). Among them, four patients accepted an ABA training design, i.e., they implemented Protocol A (hand action observation combined with repetition) in the first and third weeks and carried out Protocol B (static object observation combined with repetition) in the second week. Conversely, for the other two patients, BAB training design was adopted, i.e., patients took Protocol B in the first and third weeks and accepted Protocol A in the second week. Picture naming test, western aphasia battery (WAB) and Token Test were applied to evaluate the changes of language function before and after each week's training. Furthermore, two subjects (one aphasic patient and one healthy volunteer) attended a functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, by which we tried to reveal the mechanism underlying possible language function changes after training. RESULTS: Compared with static object observation and repetition training (Protocol B), hand action observation and repetition training (Protocol A) effectively improved most aspects of the language function in all six patients, as demonstrated in the picture naming test, subtests of oral language and aphasia quotient (AQ) of WAB. In addition, the fMRI experiment showed that Protocol A induced more activations in the MNS of one patient and one healthy control when compared to Protocol B. CONCLUSION: The mirror neuron based therapy may facilitate the language recovery for aphasic patients and this, to some extent, provides a novel direction of rehabilitation for aphasia patients.

26535620|t|Association between the interleukin-6-174 G/C polymorphism and risk of ischemic stroke: a meta-analysis.
26535620|a|Numerous studies have evaluated the association between the -174 G/C polymorphism in the interleukin-6 (IL6) gene and ischemic stroke risk. However, the results have been inconsistent. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association of the IL6 -174 G/C polymorphism with ischemic stroke. Published literatures from PubMed and Embase databases were retrieved. Pooled ORs with 95%CIs were calculated using fixed- or random-effect models. A total of seven case-control studies containing 2025 patients and 2174 controls were enrolled into this meta-analysis. In combined analysis, the results showed no significant association between the IL6 -174 G/C polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk in the overall population (GG vs CC: OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 0.50-3.01; TT vs TC: OR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.81-1.15; dominant: OR = 0.98, 95%CI = 0.70-1.38; or recessive: OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 0.57-2.70) models. In the subgroup analysis by race, no significant associations between the -174 G/C polymorphism in the IL6 gene and ischemic stroke risk were found in Caucasians or Asians. No publication bias was found in the present study (all P > 0.05). Overall, the meta-analysis results suggested that the IL6 -174 G/C polymorphism was not associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Further large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this conclusion.

26492191|t|Multiplex Brain Proteomic Analysis Revealed the Molecular Therapeutic Effects of Buyang Huanwu Decoction on Cerebral Ischemic Stroke Mice.
26492191|a|Stroke is the second-leading cause of death worldwide, and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is the only drug used for a limited group of stroke patients in the acute phase. Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD), a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, has long been used for improving neurological functional recovery in stroke. In this study, we characterized the therapeutic effect of TPA and BHD in a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CIR) injury mouse model using multiplex proteomics approach. After the iTRAQ-based proteomics analysis, 1310 proteins were identified from the mouse brain with <1% false discovery rate. Among them, 877 quantitative proteins, 10.26% (90/877), 1.71% (15/877), and 2.62% (23/877) of the proteins was significantly changed in the CIR, BHD treatment, and TPA treatment, respectively. Functional categorization analysis showed that BHD treatment preserved the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Alb, Fga, and Trf), suppressed excitotoxicity (Grm5, Gnai, and Gdi), and enhanced energy metabolism (Bdh), thereby revealing its multiple effects on ischemic stroke mice. Moreover, the neurogenesis marker doublecortin was upregulated, and the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and Tau was inhibited, which represented the neuroprotective effects.

26481508|t|XingNaoJing, prescription of traditional Chinese medicine, prevents autophagy in experimental stroke by repressing p53-DRAM pathway.
26481508|a|BACKGROUND: Xingnaojing (XNJ), a well known prescription in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for treatment of stroke in China. However, the effects and mechanisms of XNJ on autophagy are not clear. Here, we used the cell models of autophagy induced by serum-free condition and ischemia stroke in rats to further investigate whether the p53-DRAM pathway is involved in the effects of XNJ on autophagy. METHODS: We used the cell model of autophagy induced by serum-free condition and the rat model of ischemia caused by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The effects of XNJ on p53 transcriptional activity of PC12 cells were evaluated by the luciferase activity assay. The mRNA levels and the expression of p53 and its target autophagy gene DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator) were analyzed respectively by Quantitative-RTPCR and Western blot assay. The activation of autophagy was detected by the levels of autophagy markers, microtubule associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and p62 by Immunofluorescence and Western blot. p53 inhibitor was used to determine whether p53 is responsible for the effects of XNJ on preventing autophagy. RESULTS: The assay for luciferase activity of p53 promoter indicated that XNJ inhibited p53 transcriptional activity. XNJ reduced the expression of p53 and its target autophagy gene DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator) in serum-free condition PC12 cells and the cortex in MCAO rats. XNJ reduced autophagy of PC12 cells induced by serum-free condition and the cortex in MCAO rats. Furthermore, suppression of p53 by p53 inhibitor significantly reduced the effects of XNJ on the autophagy of PC12 cells in serum-free condition. CONCLUSION: XNJ prevents autophagy in experimental stroke by repressing p53/DRAM pathway. Our findings are therefore of considerable therapeutic significance and provide the novel and potential application of XNJ for the treatment of brain diseases.

26528130|t|Combination Low-Dose Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator Plus Annexin A2 for Improving Thrombolytic Stroke Therapy.
26528130|a|Risk of hemorrhagic transformation, incomplete reperfusion, neurotoxicity, and a short treatment time window comprises major challenges for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) thrombolytic stroke therapy. Improving tPA therapy has become one of the highest priorities in the stroke field. This mini review article focuses on our recent efforts aimed at evaluating a novel combination approach of low-dose tPA plus recombinant annexin A2 (rA2, a tPA, and plasminogen co-receptor), which might enhance tPA thrombolytic efficacy, while reducing its associated complications related to intracerebral hemorrhagic transformation. Results of our experimental studies using a focal embolic stroke model in rats support the feasibility of the combination approach and suggest the potential for successful clinical translation.

26452268|t|The Association of Four-Limb Blood Pressure with History of Stroke in Chinese Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study.
26452268|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI), interarm blood pressure (BP) difference and interankle BP difference, obtained by simultaneous four-limb BP measurement, with history of stroke in a Chinese adult population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1485 participants aged ≥35 years in the framework of the China Hypertension Survey. We performed simultaneous four-limb BP measurement using oscillometric devices with the participants in the supine position and calculated ABI and interarm/interankle BP differences between the 4 limbs. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association of these BP parameters and other factors with a history of stroke. RESULTS: In univariate analyses, participants with ABI <0.9, interarm BP difference ≥15 mmHg, and interankle BP difference ≥10 mmHg had a higher prevalence of stroke than those without (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0152, p = 0.002, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analyses suggested, ABI <0.9 was independently associated with a history of stroke after adjustment for interarm BP difference ≥15 mmHg, interankle BP difference ≥10 mmHg, and traditional risk factors for stroke (p = 0.001). An interankle BP difference ≥10 mmHg was associated with prior stroke after the two variables of hypertension and ABI were removed from the logistic regression model (p = 0.0142). Net reclassification improvement analysis showed that inclusion of interankle BP difference ≥10 mmHg to the independent risk factors (age, family history of stroke, hypertension, and ABI) improved net reclassification by 11.92%. CONCLUSION: ABI <0.9 is an independent risk factor for stroke prevalence in Chinese adults and it just detected a small propotion of paticipants. The addition of interankle BP difference ≥10 mmHg to the independent risk factors for stroke may improve the prediction of stroke.

26335518|t|Fully automated multidimensional reversed-phase liquid chromatography with tandem anion/cation exchange columns for simultaneous global endogenous tyrosine nitration detection, integral membrane protein characterization, and quantitative proteomics mapping in cerebral infarcts.
26335518|a|Protein tyrosine nitration (PTN) is a signature hallmark of radical-induced nitrative stress in a wide range of pathophysiological conditions, with naturally occurring abundances at substoichiometric levels. In this present study, a fully automated four-dimensional platform, consisting of high-/low-pH reversed-phase dimensions with two additional complementary, strong anion (SAX) and cation exchange (SCX), chromatographic separation stages inserted in tandem, was implemented for the simultaneous mapping of endogenous nitrated tyrosine-containing peptides within the global proteomic context of a Macaca fascicularis cerebral ischemic stroke model. This integrated RP-SA(C)X-RP platform was initially benchmarked through proteomic analyses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, revealing extended proteome and protein coverage. A total of 27 144 unique peptides from 3684 nonredundant proteins [1% global false discovery rate (FDR)] were identified from M. fascicularis cerebral cortex tissue. The inclusion of the S(A/C)X columns contributed to the increased detection of acidic, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic peptide populations; these separation features enabled the concomitant identification of 127 endogenous nitrated peptides and 137 transmembrane domain-containing peptides corresponding to integral membrane proteins, without the need for specific targeted enrichment strategies. The enhanced diversity of the peptide inventory obtained from the RP-SA(C)X-RP platform also improved analytical confidence in isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic analyses.

26869821|t|Ginsenoside Rd and ischemic stroke; a short review of literatures.
26869821|a|Panax ginseng is a well-known economic medical plant that is widely used in Chinese traditional medicine. This species contains a unique class of natural products-ginsenosides. Recent clinical and experimental studies have presented numerous lines of evidence on the promising role of ginsenosides on different diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancer. Nowadays, most of the attention has focused on ginsenoside Rd as a neuroprotective agent to attenuate ischemic stroke damages. Some of the evidence showed that ginsenoside Rd ameliorates ischemic stroke-induced damages through the suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation. Ginsenoside Rd can prolong neural cells' survival through the upregulation of the endogenous antioxidant system, phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 pathways, preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential, suppression of the nuclear factor-kappa B, transient receptor potential melastatin, acid sensing ion channels 1a, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, protein tyrosine kinase activation, as well as reduction of cytochrome c-releasing and apoptosis-inducing factor. In the current work, we review the available reports on the promising role of ginsenoside Rd on ischemic stroke. We also discuss its chemistry, source, and the molecular mechanism underlying this effect.

26169548|t|Shortened Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time Is Associated With Acute Ischemic Stroke, Stroke Severity, and Neurological Worsening.
26169548|a|BACKGROUND: The role played by hemostasis in the pathogenesis of ischemic strokes is still controversial. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) measures the time necessary to generate fibrin from initiation of the intrinsic pathway. In the present study, we looked for a possible association of ischemic strokes with the shortened APTT. METHODS: The study population consisted of 154 patients with acute ischemic strokes who had been admitted from December 2013 to December 2014 to the Department of Neurology, Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and 71 control subjects with no history of stroke. RESULTS: In a univariate risk analysis, shortened APTT was associated with an odds ratio (OR) for acute ischemic strokes of up to 1.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.29, P = .031). In a multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and shortened APTT, shortened APTT was still found to significantly add to the risk of ischemic stroke (OR = 2.12 with 95% CI, 1.13-3.98, P = .020). Shortened APTT was also associated significantly with neurological worsening (OR = 3.72 with 95% CI 1.03-13.5, P = .046). As for stroke severity, shortened APTT was associated with an OR for moderate/severe stroke of up to 3.42 (95% CI, 1.53-7.61, P = .003). CONCLUSION: Shortened APTT is a prevalent and independent risk factor for ischemic stroke, stroke severity, and neurological worsening after acute stroke.

26260947|t|Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction attenuates post‑stroke spasticity via the modulation of GABAB receptors.
26260947|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective and antispastic effects of Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction (GLGZD) in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The MCAO rats were treated with GLGZD (14.3 g/kg body weight) once a day for a period of seven days. Neurological deficit scores and screen tests were analyzed every other day. Following treatment with GLGZD for 7 days, the ischemic infarct volume of the rat brains was measured using 2,3,5‑triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction was performed in order to determine the mRNA expression levels of γ‑amino butyric acid B (γ‑GABAB) receptor (R) in the cortical infarct region. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of GABAB R were detected in the cortical infarct region by western blot analysis. Following 7 days, treatment with GLGZD significantly ameliorated the neurological defects and cerebral infarction in the MCAO rats. In addition, treatment with GLGZD ameliorated motor performance in the MCAO rats, as determined by screen tests. Furthermore, GLGZD was able to upregulate the mRNA and protein expression levels of GABAB1 R and GABAB2 R in the ischemic cerebral cortex. The results of the present study suggested that GLGZD may exert neuroprotective and antispastic effects in a cerebral ischemia model, through upregulating the expression of GABAB R.

25937213|t|The effect of trans-resveratrol on post-stroke depression via regulation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.
25937213|a|Post-stroke depression (PSD) occurs about 40% among all stroke survivors, but the effective pharmacotherapy is inadequately understood. The present study investigated the effects of a natural polyphenol trans-resveratrol (RES) on behavioral changes after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and examined what its molecular targets may be. RES was shown to decrease the infarct size and neurological scores after MCAO, suggesting the amelioration of brain damage and motor activity. RES also reversed the depressive-like behaviors 13 days after MCAO, both in the forced swimming and sucrose consumption tests. Moreover, MCAO-induced series abnormalities related to depressive-like behaviors, such as an abnormal adrenal gland weight to body weight ratio, an increased expression of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus, the differential expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in these three brain regions, and a decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level, were ameliorated after treatment with increasing doses of RES at 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg via gavage. These findings provide compelling evidence that RES protects the brain against focal cerebral ischemia-induced injury, but most of all is its antidepressant-like effect on PSD, which might at least in part be mediated by regulation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis function.

26232047|t|MiR-207/352 regulate lysosomal-associated membrane proteins and enzymes following ischemic stroke.
26232047|a|The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lysosome-mediated neuronal death and survival following ischemic stroke remains unknown. Herein, using miRNA and mRNA gene expression profiling microarrays, we identified the differentially expressed 24 miRNAs and 494 genes in the cortical peri-infarct area, respectively. Integrating the miRNA targets and mRNA expression profiles, we found 47 genes of miRNA targets, including lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), Hexb, Bcl2, etc. MiR-207 and miR-352 were mainly downregulated after ischemic stroke, followed by a slight return to baseline during post-middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 1d to 7d. Furthermore, the luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that LAMP2 and Hexb were the direct targets of miR-207 and miR-352, respectively. After lateral ventricle injection with miR-207 agonist mimics, the neurological deficit scores and infarct volumes were attenuated, and the structure of mitochondria ridges was improved. In addition, miR-207 mimics could reduce the number of cellular lysosome and autophagosome, whereas increase the number of autophagic vacuoles, indicating miR-207 might affect the latter part of lysosomal-autophagy pathway and mitochondria-induced apoptosis. These results suggested that miR-207 and miR-352 were involved in lysosomal pathway for mediating ischemic injury and spontaneous recovery. MiR-207 mimics as potential target drugs could protect against autophagic cell death after ischemic stroke.

26677672|t|[Recurrence of Cerebral Infarction Associated Aspirin Resistance or Chinese Medical Constitutions: a Correlation Study].
26677672|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between the recurrence of cerebral infarction and aspirin resistance (AR)/Chinese medical (CM) constitutions. METHODS: Totally 413 cerebral infarction patients took Aspirin Enteric-coated Tablet (100 mg per day) while receiving routine therapy, 5 days at least in a week. They were followed-up for 12 months. Aspirin sensitivity (AS) was determined using turbidimetry. CM constitutions among patients with different AS were compared. Ratios of AR patients and AS patients of different CM constitutions in cerebral infarction recurrent patients were compared. Platelet membrane glycoproteins (GP) II b HPA-3 gene polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Correlation between recurrence of cerebral infarction and AR, bb genotypes, CM constitutions times AS were analyzed by Logistic regression. RESULTS: Totally 11 patients dropped out, 101 (25.12%)with recurrent cerebral infarction and 301 (74.88%) without recurrent cerebral infarction. There were 152 (37.81%) AR patients and 250 (62.19%) AS patients. AR accounted for 26.6% (80/ 301) and AS accounted for 73.4% (221/301) in non-recurrent cerebral infarction patients. AR accounted for 71.3% (72/101) and AS accounted for 28.7% (29/101) in recurrent cerebral infarction patients. There was statistical difference in AR and AS ratios (χ2 = 64.287, P = 0.000). The proportion of yin deficiency constitution (YDC) was the largest [28.3% (43/152)] in AR patients. The proportion of blood stasis constitution (BSC) was the largest [23.6% (59/250)] in AS patients. There was statistical difference in CM constitutions between AR patients and AS patients (χ2 = 21.574, P < 0.01). The former 4 recurrent rates occurred in AR patients of YDC, BSC, damp-phlegm constitution (DPC), qi deficiency constitution (QDC). YDC occupied the first place [22.4% (34/152)]. The former 4 recurrent rates occurred in AS patients of BSC, QDC, DPC, damp-heat constitution (DHC). BSC occupied the first place [3.2% (2/250)]. Compared with non-recurrent cerebral infarction patients and AS patients, bb gene occurred most often, but aa gene and ab gene occurred obviously lesser in non-recurrent cerebral infarction patients and AR patients (χ2 = 20.171, χ2 = 55.139, P < 0.01). AR and bb gene were positively correlated with recurrent cerebral infarction (OR = 18.423, P = 0.000; OR = 1.304, P = 0.028). Body constitutions interacted with AS (OR = 0.707, P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent cerebral infarction was closely related to AR and constitutional types. The recurrence rate was higher in AR patients of YDC. GP I b HPA-3 bb genotype might be a risk factor for AR and recurrent cerebral infarction.

26629210|t|Relationship between adiponectin receptor 1 gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke.
26629210|a|OBJECTIVE: Previous study suggested adiponectin receptor 2 (ADIPOR2) genetic polymorphisms were associated with the risk of ischemic stroke. However, the relation between adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1) gene polymorphism and stroke remains unclear. METHODS: In the present study, we utilized the polymerase chain reaction-sequencing method to detect rs2275737 and s1342387 genotypes of ADIPOR1 gene in 300 cases of ischemic stroke patients and 300 age- and sex- matched healthy controls. RESULTS: For rs2275737, we found A allele carriers have increased risk to ischemic stroke (OR=2.570, 95% CI: 1.999-3.305); also, we found rs1342387 A allele was associated with the risk for stroke (OR=1.351, 95% CI: 1.074-1.699). After adjusted for confounders such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, we found the association remains significant. CONCLUSION: ADIPOR1 genetic polymorphism may increase the risk of ischemic stroke.

26239152|t|Common and unique mechanisms of Chinese herbal remedies on ischemic stroke mice revealed by transcriptome analyses.
26239152|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Four traditional Chinese herbal remedies (CHR) including Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD), Xuefu Zhuyu decoction (XZD), Tianma Gouteng decoction (TGD) and Shengyu decoction (SYD) are popular used in treating brain-related dysfunction clinically with different syndrome/pattern based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) principles, yet their neuroprotective mechanisms are still unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were subjected to an acute ischemic stroke to examine the efficacy and molecular mechanisms of action underlying these CHR. RESULTS: CHR treatment significantly enhanced the survival rate of stroke mice, with BHD being the most effective CHR. All CHR were superior to recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment in successfully ameliorating brain function, infarction, and neurological deficits in stroke mice that also paralleled to improvements in blood-brain barrier damage, inflammation, apoptosis, and neurogenesis. Transcriptome analyses reveals that a total of 774 ischemia-induced probe sets were significantly modulated by four CHR, including 52 commonly upregulated genes and 54 commonly downregulated ones. Among them, activation of neurogenesis-associated signaling pathways and down-regulating inflammation and apoptosis pathways are key common mechanisms in ischemic stroke protection by all CHR. Besides, levels of plasma CX3CL1 and S100a9 in patients could be used as biomarkers for therapeutic evaluation before functional recovery could be observed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that using CHR, a combinatory cocktail therapy, is a better way than rt-PA for treating cerebral ischemic-associated diseases through modulating a common as well as a specific group of genes/pathways that may partially explain the syndrome differentiation and treatment principle in TCM.

26187277|t|Prescription patterns of Chinese herbal products for patients with fractures in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study.
26187277|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in the treatment of fracture for thousands of years. However, large-scale surveys examing the utilization of Chinese herbal products (CHPs) for treating fractures and their related symptoms are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the prescription patterns of CHPs among patients with fractures in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TCM usage in patients with fractures was analyzed using a sample of one million individuals randomly selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database who were newly diagnosis with fractures in 2001-2008, with a followed-up period through 2010. RESULTS: We identified 115,327 patients who were newly diagnosed with fractures in the study population. Among them, 4.97% (n=5731) adjunctively utilized TCM for fracture treatment. TCM users were mostly young or middle-aged, female, and resided in highly urbanized areas. With regard to the comorbidities of fractures, TCM users had a lower prevalence of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and stroke than non-TCM users, except for osteoporosis. Shu-jing-huo-xue-tang was the most frequently prescribed Chinese herbal formula, while Rhizoma Drynariae (Gu-sui-bu) was the most common single herb for patients with fractures. The CHPs were found to cover not only bone healing but also fracture-related symptoms. TCM users had lower medical expenditure for hospitalization for the first six months after incident fractures than non-TCM users (1749±2650 versus 2274±3159 US dollars, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified the TCM utilization for patients with fractures in Taiwan. Integration of TCM treatment reduced the medical costs for hospitalization. Further basic research and clinical studies to investigate the mechanism and clinical efficacies of CHPs are warranted.

26342636|t|Treadmill exercise enhances therapeutic potency of transplanted bone mesenchymal stem cells in cerebral ischemic rats via anti-apoptotic effects.
26342636|a|BACKGROUND: The transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) has proved to ameliorate ischemic brain injury in animals, but most transplanted MSCs undergo apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra, greatly compromising the therapeutic value of this treatment. Meanwhile, cell apoptosis can be inhibited by post-ischemia exercise which has been demonstrated to improve the expression of related anti-apoptotic proteins. The present study investigated whether treadmill exercise enhances the neuroprotective effects of transplanted MSCs in a rat experimental stroke model. RESULT: Rats were subjected to 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, they were assigned randomly to receive no MSCs treatment and no exercise (control group), intravenous transplantation of MSCs and treadmill exercise (MSCs + Ex group), MSCs transplantation only (MSCs group) and treadmill exercise only (Ex group). Neurological assessment, TUNEL staining and western blot were performed. Compared with the MSCs group and Ex group, the MSCs + Ex group reported markedly improved neurological function, significantly decreased apoptotic cells, and increased expressions of survivin and bcl-2 (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, respectively). Interestingly, the treadmill exercise significantly inhibited the apoptosis of transplanted MSCs. As a result, the number of engrafted MSCs in the MSCs + Ex group was significantly higher than that in the MSC group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Treadmill exercise enhances the therapeutic potency of MSCs by improving neurological function and possibly inhibiting the apoptosis of neuron cells and transplanted MSCs. These effects may involve an increased expression of survivin and bcl-2.

27333830|t|BNG-1 in the Recovery of Acute Ischemic Stroke: A phase 2, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Randomized Trial.
27333830|a|PURPOSE: Few strategies have been approved for acute therapy of ischemic stroke in Western medicine. Hundreds of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have been used for stroke therapy and were rarely tested by qualified studies. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of BNG-1, a novel mixture of TCMs, in patients with acute ischemic stroke, we conducted the clinical trial. METHODS: This was a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which the safety and efficacy of orally administered BNG-1 based on oral aspirin 100 mg daily for consecutive 14 days were measured in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 10 days after onset. The primary efficacy endpoint was the functional status assessed by the Barthel Index. The safety was evaluated by the incidence of adverse events and significant changes in vital signs, parameters of physical and laboratory examinations. RESULTS: There were 42 patients randomized for the intention-to-treat efficacy analysis. The study failed to prove the significantly statistical difference of efficacy assessment between patients receiving BNG- 1 and placebo in the recovery of acute ischemic stroke. The clinical and laboratory safety profiles had no significant difference between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: BNG-1 trial was feasible, safe and well tolerated for patients with acute ischemic stroke based on the treatment of aspirin, though there was no statistically significant difference of efficacy between BNG-1 and placebo groups. A further large Phase 3 trial of BNG-1 is needed before recommending such treatments for general clinical use.

24938446|t|Appraisal of clinical practice guidelines for ischemic stroke management in Chinese medicine with appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation instrument: A systematic review.
24938446|a|OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for ischemic stroke in Chinese medicine (CM) with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. METHODS: CM CPGs for ischemic stroke were searched in 5 online databases and hand-searches in CPGrelated handbooks published from January 1990 to December 2012. The CPGs were categorized into evidence based (EB) guideline, consensus based with no explicit consideration of evidence based (CB-EB) guideline and consensus based (CB) guideline according to the development method. Three reviewers independently appraised the CPGs based on AGREE II instrument, and compared the CPGs' recommendations on CM pattern classification and treatment. RESULTS: Five CM CPGs for ischemic stroke were identified and included. Among them, one CPG was EB guideline, two were CB guidelines and two were CB-EB guidelines. The quality score of the EB guideline was higher than those of the CB-EB and CB guidelines. Five CM patterns in the CPGs were recommended in the EB CPG. The comprehensive protocol of integrative Chinese and Western medicine recommended in the EB CPG was mostly recommended for ischemic stroke in the CPGs. The recommendations varied based on the CM patterns. CONCLUSION: The quality of EB CPG was higher than those of CB and CB-EB CPGs in CM for ischemic stroke and integrative approaches were included in CPGs as major interventions.

26141965|t|Borderline ankle-brachial index is associated with increased prevalence of micro- and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes: A cross-sectional analysis of 12,772 patients from the Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation Program.
26141965|a|Borderline ankle-brachial index is increasingly recognised as a marker of cardiovascular risk. We evaluated the impact of borderline ankle-brachial index in 12,772 Chinese type 2 diabetes patients from the Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation Program between 2007 and 2012. Cardiovascular risk factors, complications and health-related quality of life were compared between patients with normal ankle-brachial index (1.0-1.4), borderline ankle-brachial index (0.90-0.99) and peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial index < 0.9). The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease and borderline ankle-brachial index was 4.6% and 9.6%, respectively. Borderline ankle-brachial index patients were older, more likely to be smokers and hypertensive, had longer duration of diabetes, poorer kidney function and poorer health-related quality of life than patients with normal ankle-brachial index. After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, borderline ankle-brachial index was an independent predictor of diabetes-related micro- and macrovascular complications including retinopathy (odd ratios: 1.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.37)), macroalbuminuria (1.31 (1.10-1.56)), chronic kidney disease (1.22 (1.00-1.50)) and stroke (1.31 (1.05-1.64)). These findings suggest that patients with diabetes and borderline ankle-brachial index are at increased cardiovascular risk and may benefit from more intensive management.

26622408|t|Preconditioning with Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction enhances H2O2-induced Nrf2/HO-1 activation in PC12 cells.
26622408|a|Spasticity is common in various central neurological conditions, including after a stroke. Such spasticity may cause additional problems, and often becomes a primary concern for afflicted individuals. A number of studies have identified nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) as a key regulator in the adaptive survival response to oxidative stress. Elevated expression of Nrf2, combined with heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) resistance, in the central nervous system is known to elicit key internal and external oxidation protection. Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction (GLGZD) is a popular traditional Chinese formula with a long history of clinical use in China for the treatment of muscular spasticity following a stroke, epilepsy or a spinal cord injury. However, the mechanism underlying the efficacy of the medicine remains unclear. In the present study, the antioxidative effects of GLGZD were evaluated and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated, using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) as an in vitro oxidative stress model of neural cells. Upon application of different concentrations of GLGZD, a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and ATP measurement were conducted to assess the impact on PC12 cell proliferation. In addition, inverted microscopy observations, and the MTT and ATP assessments, revealed that GLGZD attenuated H2O2-induced oxidative damage and signaling repression in PC12 cells. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, which are associated with oxidative stress, were analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy observations, as well as the quantitative PCR assay, revealed that GLGZD exerted a neuroprotective function against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells. Therefore, the results demonstrated that GLGZD protected PC12 cells injured by H2O2, which may be associated with the upregulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA and protein expression levels in PC12 cells.

25443438|t|The experiences and needs of Chinese-Canadian stroke survivors and family caregivers as they re-integrate into the community.
25443438|a|Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability and community re-integration is a priority for stroke rehabilitation. In North America, we have a growing population of individuals whose first language is not English. Little is known about the experiences of visible minorities living in North America as they re-integrate into the community post stroke or how these experiences change over time. Specifically, this research aimed to explore the experiences and needs of Chinese stroke survivors and family caregivers as they return to community living using the Timing it Right Framework as a conceptual guide. We recruited Cantonese-speaking stroke survivors and family caregivers from outpatient rehabilitation programmes. Using qualitative interviews conducted in Cantonese or English, we examined their experiences and needs as they return to community living and explored the influence of culture and time on their experiences. The interviews were transcribed and translated, and then analysed using framework analysis. Using framework analysis, we coded the data corresponding to the phases of the Timing it Right framework to determine the influence of time on the themes. We interviewed five Cantonese-speaking stroke survivors and 13 caregivers in 2009. We identified two main themes: (i) Participants' education and support needs change over time and (ii) Chinese resources are needed across care environments. These resources include access to care in their preferred language, traditional Chinese medicine, and Chinese food during their recovery and rehabilitation. To optimise Chinese stroke survivors' and caregivers' community re-integration, healthcare professionals should provide timely and accessible education and be aware of the role of Chinese diet and traditional medicine in stroke survivors' rehabilitation.

26617842|t|Electroacupuncture modulated the inflammatory reaction in MCAO rats via inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in microglia.
26617842|a|In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of electroacupuncture on the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in microglia. Male Wistar rat of SPF grade (weighing 200 ± 20 g) were randomly divided into (i): sham control group, which was subjected to sham operation (ii) vehicle group, which underwent the occlusion of middle cerebral artery; (iii-v): acupuncture groups, which were subjected to the occlusion of middle cerebral artery and treated with acupuncture on the Neiguan acupoint (P6), Quchi acupoint (LI11), and Diji acupoint (SP8), respectively. HE staining was performed to detect the necrotic rate of neurons. Mediators of inflammation were measured using ELISA. Immunofluorescence was performed to measure the expression of TLR4, HMGB1, TRAF6, IKKβ and NF-κB p65 in microglia. Severe decrease was noticed in the neurological score, necrotic rates of neuron, expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TLR4, HMGB1, TRAF6, IKKβ and NF-κB p65 in microglia. Compared with the vehicle group, significant decrease was revealed in the neurological score, necrotic rate, IL-1β, TLR4, TRAF6, IKKβ and NF-κB p65 in Neiguan group and Quchi group, respectively. In addition, remarkable decrease was observed in the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in Quchi group. Compared with the Diji group, the necrotic rate of neurons in hippocampus region was significantly decreased in the Quchi group (P < 0.05). In Neiguan group, the expression of TLR4 and IKKβ was significantly attenuated (P < 0.05). The expression of TRAF6 was remarkably decreased in the Neiguan group and Quchi group, respectively. Electroacupuncture on Neiguan and Quchi could improve the neurological injury, attenuate the inflammation, and inhibit the activity of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in microglia.

26196346|t|Prediction of Reperfusion-Associated Hemorrhagic Transformation Using Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Imaging in a Rat Stroke Model.
26196346|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reperfusion-associated hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is an important complication of recanalization therapy. A method to identify stroke victims that may undergo HT will improve the patient selection and safety of this treatment. In this study, we determined the relationship between timing of reperfusion and the frequency and severity of HT, and whether very early dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging predicts the occurrence of reperfusion-associated HT in a model of experimental stroke. METHODS: Intraluminal suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was used to produce transient ischemia in male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 50). Reperfusion was performed by withdrawal of the occluding filament after 3 (n = 10), 4 (n = 10), 5 (n = 10), 6 (n = 10), or 7 (n = 10) hours. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed before reperfusion using DCE, susceptibility-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and T2- and T1-weighted imaging. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging and histological studies were performed at 24 hours. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic transformation occurred by 24 hours after injury in 8 of 50 animals. The HT rate increased with prolonged ischemic duration. All animals exhibiting acute blood-brain barrier (BBB) perturbation subsequently developed HT by 24 hours. Statistically significant differences in the BBB permeability parameters (P < 0.05) between the HT group and non-HT group were detected by DCE imaging. There were also statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between the HT area and adjacent HT area. Among the permeability parameters, subcortex rK was the most sensitive and specific predictor of HT. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the use of quantitative BBB measurements may further improve early prediction and identification of HT. The DCE parameters were the sensitive early independent predictor of reperfusion-associated HT.

26343099|t|Autophagy in cerebral ischemia and the effects of traditional Chinese medicine.
26343099|a|Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated degradation process for non-essential or damaged cellular constituents, playing an important homeostatic role in cell survival, differentiation and development to maintain homeostasis. Autophagy is involved in tumors as well as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Recently, active compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been found to modulate the levels of autophagy in tumor cells, nerve cells, myocardial cells and endothelial cells. Ischemic stroke is a major cause of neurological disability and places a heavy burden on family and society. Regaining function can significantly reduce dependence and improve the quality of life of stroke survivors. In healthy cells, autophagy plays a key role in adapting to nutritional deprivation and eliminating aggregated proteins, however inappropriate activation of autophagy may lead to cell death in cerebral ischemia. This paper reviews the process and the molecular basis of autophagy, as well as its roles in cerebral ischemia and the roles of TCM in modulating its activity.

26159646|t|Variants in the Atherogenic ALOX5AP, THBD, and KNG1 Genes Potentiate the Risk of Ischemic Stroke via a Genetic Main Effect and Epistatic Interactions in a Chinese Population.
26159646|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a multifactorial disease that displays a strong genetic predisposition. However, the genetic architecture of IS has yet to be fully elucidated. It was hypothesized that epistasis between genes in multiple atherothrombotic pathways may play a vital role in determining the susceptibility to IS. The aim of the present study was to investigate the contributions of the hypothesized genetic factors to IS and the interactions between these genetic factors in a Chinese population. METHODS: In this study, 351 cases with IS and 417 control subjects from a Chinese population were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 genes hypothesized to be involved in atherosclerosis, coagulation, and related pathways. We examined SNP main effects and epistatic interactions between these polymorphic loci. RESULTS: rs710446 of the KNG1 gene was associated with IS susceptibility based on an additive genetic model (rs710446: P = .012; odds ratio [OR], 1.247; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.050-1.481) after adjusting for covariates. Furthermore, an epistatic interaction between the ALOX5AP, THBD, and KNG1 gene was also identified in association with stroke susceptibility (P < .001 after 1000 permutations). Based on the chi-squared test, the OR of the high-risk combination of the three-locus model increased the risk of IS by 2.53-fold (95% CI, 1.60-4.01; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the association of the epistatic interactions of ALOX5AP, THBD, and KNG1 and present novel evidence for the main effect of KNG1 gene on IS susceptibility, suggesting a modulation of stroke risk by a genetic main effect and gene-gene interactions.

26983210|t|[Preliminary study on substitution of Antelope Horn in Danqi Piantan capsule with artificial bezoar].
26983210|a|To study the protective effect of Danqi Piantan capsule ( DPC) and its antelope horn substitution (DPCAS) on the cerebral ischemia, in order to preliminary study the possibility of replacing antelope horn with artificial bezoar. In this study, the left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was adopted. Totally 150 SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: the sham operation group, the model group, the Danqi Piantan capsule (DPC) group (0.246 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)), the Danqi Piantan capsule without antelope horn (DPCRA) group (0.246 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)), the Danqi Piantan capsule without antelope horn and with double artificial bezoar (DPCDB) group (0.246 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)). The MCAO model was prepared 1 h later after the administration on the 5th day. At 24 h after the operation, the inner canthus blood was collected to determine the serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the endothelin (ET) content. At 72 h after the operation, the cerebral infarct size and the cerebral index were determined by TTC-staining. The fluorescent quantitative PCR method was used to detect brain Bcl-2, Caspase-3, IL-1β, P-selectin, E-selectin, ICAM-1 mRNA expressions. The mmunohistochemical method was used to detect ICAM-1, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 expressions in ischemic penumbra. According to the results, compared with the model group, DPCDB and DPC groups showed almost consistent results, indicating both of the two group can significantly improved cerebral infarction index and cerebral index (P < 0.05), increase the serum SOD activity (P < 0.05), decrease the serum ET level and Caspase-3 expression, IL-1β, P-selectin, E-selectin, ICAM-1 mRNA expressions in brain tissues (P < 0.05) and expressions of ICAM-1, IL-1,6, TNF-α, IL-6 positive cells in ischemic penumbra (P < 0.05) and increase the Bcl-2 expression (P < 0.05). The DPCRA group showed much lower impacts on indexes than DPCDB and DPC groups. This suggests that DPCDB and DPC reveal similar efficacies and antelope horn in Danqi Piantan capsule can be substitutes by artificial bezoar.

26322893|t|Demographic and Prescribing Patterns of Chinese Herbal Products for Individualized Therapy for Ischemic Heart Disease in Taiwan: Population-Based Study.
26322893|a|OBJECTIVE: Combinations of Chinese herbal products (CHPs) are widely used for ischemic heart disease (IHD) in Taiwan. We analyzed the usage and frequency of CHPs prescribed for patients with IHD. METHODS: A nationwide population-based cross-sectional study was conducted, 53531 patients from a random sample of one million in the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from 2000 to 2010 were enrolled. Descriptive statistics, the multiple logistic regression method and Poisson regression analysis were employed to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) for utilization of CHPs. RESULTS: The mean age of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) nonusers was significantly higher than that of TCM users. Zhi-Gan-Cao-Tang (24.85%) was the most commonly prescribed formula CHPs, followed by Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang (16.53%) and Sheng-Mai-San (16.00%). The most commonly prescribed single CHPs were Dan Shen (29.30%), Yu Jin (7.44%), and Ge Gen (6.03%). After multivariate adjustment, patients with IHD younger than 29 years had 2.62 times higher odds to use TCM than those 60 years or older. Residents living in Central Taiwan, having hyperlipidemia or cardiac dysrhythmias also have higher odds to use TCM. On the contrary, those who were males, who had diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) were less likely to use TCM. CONCLUSIONS: Zhi-Gan-Cao-Tang and Dan Shen are the most commonly prescribed CHPs for IHD in Taiwan. Our results should be taken into account by physicians when devising individualized therapy for IHD. Further large-scale, randomized clinical trials are warranted in order to determine the effectiveness and safety of these herbal medicines.

26345966|t|Investigation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in phosphodiesterase 4D gene in Mongol and Han patients with ischemic stroke in Inner Mongolia.
26345966|a|We investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at 87 sites of the phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene in Mongol and Han patients with ischemic stroke in Inner Mongolia. SNPs in 226 patients with ischemic stroke (case group, 110 Mongol patients, 116 Han patients) and 220 patients without neurological disease (control group, 102 Mongol patients, 118 Han patients) were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and gene sequencing. The genotype and allele frequencies of all groups were compared. There were no statistically significant differences in genotypes in the PDE4D gene at 87 sites between the case and control groups (P > 0.05). The C allele frequency in the case group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The CC genotype and C allele frequencies in the Mongol case subgroup were higher than those in the Mongol control subgroup (P < 0.05). The CC genotype and C allele frequencies in the Han case subgroup were higher than those in the Han control subgroup (P < 0.05). In the case group, there were no significant differences at 87 sites for genotypes and allele frequencies between the Mongol and Han subgroups. In the control group, there were no significant differences at 87 site genotypes and allele frequencies between the Mongol and Han subgroups. The increase in the C allele frequency at 87 SNP sites in PDE4D may increase ischemic stroke risk. We found no differences in the risk between Mongol and Han populations in Inner Mongolia.

26291978|t|Effect of Traditional Chinese Exercise on Gait and Balance for Stroke: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
26291978|a|OBJECTIVE: A systematic review is conducted to determine the effect of traditional Chinese exercise for patients with stroke. METHODS: Studies are obtained from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, Web of Science, and CNKI. Only randomized controlled trials were left to evaluate the effects of traditional Chinese exercise for patients with stroke, and with no limits on study data or language. The primary outcome was the Berg balance score (BBS), Functional walking scale. And a random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 9 studies on 820 participants conform to the inclusion criteria, whereas eight studies on 704 participants are used as data sources for the meta-analysis, all trials were published between 2004 and 2013. The BBS indicates that the efficacy of traditional Chinese exercise on balance of patients with stroke is better than that of other training or no training in short term [MD (95%CI) = 11.85 [5.41, 18.30], P < 0.00001]. And the short physical performance battery, Functional walking scale, limit of stability were observed significant differences on balance (p<0.05) and gait (p<0.05) between traditional Chinese exercise and other exercises or no exercise. In addition, there is an article showed that some other form (physiotherapy exercises focused on balance) significantly improved balance ability for stroke patients compared to tai chi chuan practice (Berg test = 0.01, Romberg, and standing on one leg). CONCLUSION: In our meta analysis, the positive findings of this study suggest traditional Chinese exercise has beneficial effects on the balance ability in short term. However, we drew the conclusion according to the extreme heterogeneity, and evidence of better quality and from a larger sample size is required. Because of the inconsistent outcomes, there are short of enough good evidence for patients with stroke to prove the effects of traditional Chinese exercise on gait.

26149229|t|Low dose tPA plus annexin A2 combination attenuates tPA delayed treatment-associated hemorrhage and improves recovery in rat embolic focal stroke.
26149229|a|We previously have shown that tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) in combination with its receptor annexin A2 (rA2) protein significantly improved tPA thrombolytic efficacy. In this study we aimed to examine the therapeutic effects of the combination when treated at delayed 4-hour window after stroke compared to standard conventional tPA alone in an embolic focal stroke rat model. We compared effects of intravenous tPA alone (10 mg/kg) versus a combination of low-dose tPA (5 mg/kg) plus 10 mg/kg rA2. Totally 152 rats were used. Our results showed that: (1) at 24 h after stroke, the combination slightly reduced brain infarction compared to saline (9.2% reduction), and tPA (7.4% reduction), although the reductions did not reach statistical significance; while the combination significantly reduced (22.2% reduction) the conventional tPA-elevated intracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) transformation; (2) at 7 days after stroke, the combination significantly attenuated conventional tPA alone-elevated iron deposition at peri-lesion area (68.2% reduction); (3) at 28 days after stroke, the combination significantly improved performance of adhesive tape-removal test, which was accompanied by a significantly higher micro vessel density at peri- infarct areas compared to conventional tPA alone group.In conclusion, compared to conventional tPA alone, when treated at delayed 4-hour after stroke, the combination of low-dose tPA plus rA2 therapy provides a safer profile by lowering risk of ICH transformation and improves neurological function recovery after stroke.

26236546|t|Herbal Formula Danggui-Shaoyao-San Promotes Neurogenesis and Angiogenesis in Rat Following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion.
26236546|a|Current studies demonstrated that traditional Chinese herbal formula Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS) is not only used for the treatment of menstrual disorder, but has also found its use in neurological diseases. However, the neuroprotective role of DSS on ischemia-induced brain injury is still unclear. The aim of the present study is to explore the effect of DSS in ischemic brain injury. Total 30 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 90 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). DSS (600 mg/kg) was administered through the intragastric route at the time of reperfusion and then performed every day thereafter until sacrifice. Results showed that DSS treatment significantly improved neurobehavioral outcomes (N=10 per group, P<0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that microvessel density in the perifocal region of DSS-treated rats was significantly increased compared to the saline-treated group (N=4 per group, P<0.01). Similarly, the numbers of BrdU(+)/DCX(+) cells in the subventricular zone were increased in DSS-treated rats compared to the saline-treated group (P<0.05). Furthermore, we demonstrated that DSS treatment activated vascular endothelial growth factor (N=4 per group, P<0.05) and promoted eNOS phosphorylation (N=4 per group, P<0.05). Thus, we concluded that DSS promoted focal angiogenesis and neurogenesis, and attenuated ischemia-induced brain injury in rats after MCAO, suggesting that DSS is a potential drug for ischemic stroke therapy.

25098257|t|Combination treatment with Gua Sha and Blood-letting causes attenuation of systemic inflammation, activated coagulation, tissue ischemia and injury during heatstroke in rats.
25098257|a|OBJECTIVE: Gua Sha and Blood-letting at the acupoints were Chinese traditional therapies for heatstroke. The purpose of present study was to assess the therapeutic effect of Gua Sha on the DU Meridian and Bladder Meridian combined with Blood-letting acupoints at Shixuan (EX-UE 11) and Weizhong (BL 40) on heatstroke. METHODS: Anesthetized rats, immediately after the onset of heatstroke, were divided into four major groups: Gua Sha group, Blood-letting group, Gua Sha combined with Blood-letting group and model group. They were exposed to ambient temperature of 43 °C to induce heatstroke. Another group of rats were exposed to room temperature (26 °C) and used as normal control group. Their survival times were measured. In addition, their physiological and biochemical parameters were continuously monitored. RESULTS: When rats underwent heatstroke, their survival time values were found to be 21-25 min. Treatment of Gua Sha combined with Bloodletting greatly improved the survival time (230±22 min) during heatstroke. All heatstoke animals displayed and activated coagulation evidenced by increased prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), D-dimer, and decreased platelet count, protein C. Furthermore, the animals displayed systemic inflammation evidenced by increased the serum levels of cytokines interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Biochemical markers evidenced by cellular ischemia and injury/dysfunction included increased plasma levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were all elevated during heatstroke. Core temperatures (Tco) were also increased during heatstroke. In contrast, the values of mean arterial pressure were signifificantly lower during heatstroke. These heatstroke reactions were all signifificantly suppressed by treatment of Gua Sha and Blood-letting, especially the combination therapy. CONCLUSION: Gua Sha combined with Blood-letting after heatstroke may improve survival by ameliorating systemic inflflammation, hypercoagulable state, and tissue ischemia and injury in multiple organs.

26197838|t|Trace Amounts of Copper in Drinking Water Aggravate Cerebral Ischemic Injury via Impairing Endothelial Progenitor Cells in Mice.
26000464|t|Exosomes/microvesicles from induced pluripotent stem cells deliver cardioprotective miRNAs and prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the ischemic myocardium.
26000464|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) exhibit enhanced survival and proliferation in ischemic tissues. However, the therapeutic application of iPS cells is limited by their tumorigenic potential. We hypothesized that iPS cells can transmit cytoprotective signals to cardiomyocytes via exosomes/microvesicles. METHODS: Exosomes/microvesicles secreted from mouse cardiac fibroblast (CF)-derived iPS cells (iPS-exo) were purified from conditioned medium and confirmed by electron micrograph, size distribution and zeta potential by particle tracking analyzer and protein expression of the exosome markers CD63 and Tsg101. RESULTS: We observed that exosomes are at low zeta potential, and easily aggregate. Temperature affects zeta potential (-14 to -15 mV at 23 °C vs -24 mV at 37 °C). The uptake of iPS-exo protects H9C2 cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress by inhibiting caspase 3/7 activation (P < 0.05, n = 6). Importantly, iPS-exo treatment can protect against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MIR) injury via intramyocardial injection into mouse ischemic myocardium before reperfusion. Furthermore, iPS-exo deliver cardioprotective miRNAs, including nanog-regulated miR-21 and HIF-1α-regulated miR-210, to H9C2 cardiomyocytes in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes/microvesicles secreted by iPS cells are very effective at transmitting cytoprotective signals to cardiomyocytes in the setting of MIR. iPS-exo thus represents novel biological nanoparticles that offer the benefits of iPS cell therapy without the risk of tumorigenicity and can potentially serve as an "off-the-shelf" therapy to rescue ischemic cardiomyocytes in conditions such as MIR.

25796380|t|Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) Enhances Angiogenic Effect of Mesenchymal Stem Cell by Upregulating VEGF Expression After Focal Cerebral Ischemia.
25796380|a|Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD) has been used for centuries to treat paralysis and stroke. Previously, we have demonstrated that BYHWD combined with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation attenuates ischemic injury partly by upregulating angiogenesis. However, the mechanisms of this drug for stroke treatment are not completely understood. Here, we aimed to clarify the mechanism of BYHWD on angiogenesis mediated by MSCs. Firstly, we verified microvessels with a size of 50-100 nm produced by either MSCs or MSCs treated by 500 μg/ml BYHWD. These exosomes were purified and found to be able to activate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in endothelial cells (ECs). Moreover, exosomes from MSCs and MSCs treated by BYHWD induced elevated microRNA (miRNA)-126 expression and reduced miR-221 and miR-222 expression. In MSCs, disruption of dicer, an enzyme responsible for miRNA maturation, by dicer small interfering RNA (siRNA), or RNase pretreatment abolished this ability of the exosomes. Additionally, exosomes from MSCs treated by BYHWD promoted VEGF and Ki-67 expression and augmented vascular density in rat brain after bilateral carotid artery ligation. In conclusion, our study revealed that BYHWD exposure augmented angiogenetic miRNA and VEGF expression in exosomes secreted by MSCs and elevated angiogenesis in rat brain.

26037401|t|Electro-acupuncture up-regulates astrocytic MCT1 expression to improve neurological deficit in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats.
26037401|a|AIMS: Cerebral ischemia is one of the common diseases treated by electro-acupuncture (EA). Although the clinical efficacy has been widely affirmed, the mechanisms of action leading to the health benefits are not understood. In this study, the role of EA in modulating the lactate energy metabolism and lactate transportation was explored on the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) ischemic rat model. MAIN METHODS: Repeated EA treatments once daily for 7 days were applied to the MCAO rats and neurological function evaluation was performed. Brain tissues were harvested for lactate concentration examination, immunohistochemical staining, Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses for the expressions of lactate transporter (monocarboxylate transporter 1, MCT1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). KEY FINDINGS: The animal behavioral tests showed that the 7-day EA treatments significantly promoted the recovery of neurological deficits in the MCAO rats, which correlated with the enhanced lactate energy metabolism in the ischemic brain. In the cortical ischemic area of the MCAO rats, EA treatments led to the activation of astrocytes, and induced a further increase of lactate transporter (monocarboxylate transporter 1, MCT1) expression in astrocytes at both protein and mRNA levels. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the EA treatments activated lactate metabolism in the resident astrocytes around the ischemic area and up-regulated the expression of MCT1 in these astrocytes which facilitated the transfer of intracellular lactate to extracellular domain to be utilized by injured neurons to improve the neurological deficit.

25936438|t|Electroacupuncture pretreatment attenuates blood‑brain barrier disruption following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
25936438|a|Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and subsequent brain edema are major contributors to the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, however, current clinical therapeutic methods remains unsatisfactory. Electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment has a protective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the effect of EA pretreatment on BBB disruption was investigated in a focal I/R rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (280-320 g) were pretreated with EA at the acupoint 'Baihui' (GV20) 30 min/day, for five days consecutively prior to focal cerebral I/R, which was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h. The results demonstrated that the infarction volume, brain water content and neurological deficits increased in the MCAO model rats at 3 h and 24 h post-reperfusion, and were attenuated significantly by EA pretreatment. Furthermore, electron microscopy examination confirmed a reduction in brain edema reduction in the EA pretreated rats. Western blot analysis revealed that the tight junction proteins between endothelial cells, including claudin-5, occludin, were significantly degraded, while the protein expression of phosphorylated (p-)caveolin-1 and p-Akt increased following reperfusion, all of which were alleviated by EA pretreatment. However, no significant differences were observed in the expression of caveolin-1 or Akt. Overall, the results demonstrated that EA pretreatment significantly reduced BBB permeability and brain edema, which were correlated with alleviation of the degradation of tight junction proteins and inhibition of the expression of p-caveolin-1 in the endothelial cells.

25911293|t|Salidroside-Mediated Neuroprotection is Associated with Induction of Early Growth Response Genes (Egrs) Across a Wide Therapeutic Window.
25911293|a|Salidroside exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic properties. To identify whether salidroside might be a candidate for treating ischemic stroke, we investigated the effects of salidroside or vehicle, given daily for 6 days, after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h and reperfusion for either 1 or 48 h in rats. Salidroside reduced cerebral infarct volume and significantly improved neurological scores whether started after 1 or 48 h of reperfusion. Microarray analysis showed that 20 % (133/678) of the genes down-regulated by ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion were up-regulated by salidroside, whereas 13 % (105/829) of the genes induced by ischemia-reperfusion were inhibited by salidroside, suggesting that salidroside can reverse effects of ischemia-reperfusion on gene expression. The main enriched functional categories induced by salidroside were genes related to synaptic plasticity, whereas salidroside inhibited genes related to inflammation. Induction of Egr1, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc by salidroside was confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blotting in ischemic brains treated after either 1 or 48 h of reperfusion. The potential protective role of Egr4 in salidroside-mediated neuroprotection was subsequently investigated in CoCl2-treated PC12 cells. Egr4 was dose-dependently induced by salidroside in PC12 cells, and depleting Egr4 with target-specific siRNA increased caspase-3 activity and Bax, but decreased Bcl-xl, which were reversed by salidroside. Finally, we confirmed that salidroside inhibited the Bax/Bcl-xl-related apoptosis after MCAO with reperfusion. In conclusion, salidroside is highly neuroprotective with a wide therapeutic time window after ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat, and this partially involves induction of Egrs, leading to inhibition of Bax/Bcl-xl-related apoptosis.

26190397|t|Effects of Salvia miltiorrhiza on CNS Neuronal Injury and Degeneration: A Plausible Complementary Role of Tanshinones and Depsides.
26190397|a|Salvia miltiorrhiza is a very important herbal drug of traditional Chinese medicine. Bioactive constituents are represented by two main groups of secondary metabolites, the lipophilic diterpenic quinones known as tanshinones and the hydrophilic depsides known as salvianolic acids. S. miltiorrhiza extracts and single constituents have been shown to have positive effects in central nervous system neuronal injury and degeneration in several animal models by various biological mechanisms. Both tanshinones and depsides protect against β-amyloid-induced toxicity, but their mechanisms are complementary due to their different structure, the lipophilic tanshinones and the hydrophilic depsides. A number of anti-inflammatory mechanisms is also reported for both tanshinones and depsides. Common mechanisms are the effects on cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. In addition, depsides are inhibitors of nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase-2, while tanshinones inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and nuclear factor kappa β. Both constituents can also modulate the protection of the central nervous system from oxidative stress with different but complementary mechanisms: tanshinones can enhance the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, while depsides can decrease reactive oxygen species.Furthermore, neuronal death underlies the symptoms of many human neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, stroke, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Both classes of constituents can enhance the antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia protein-2 family members and decrease the translocation of cytochrome c, and, in addition, depsides decrease caspase-3 and intracellular Ca(2+). Again, both classes of constituents have an activity on vascular endothelial growth factor but it is opposite, whereas tanshinones are inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase.Besides the extensive studies reporting on the biological mechanisms of depsides and tanshinones, pharmacokinetics studies are still very limited and not conclusive, especially for brain distribution. Further research is warranted to address the mechanisms of the multitarget actions of S. miltiorrhiza constituents and to translate this knowledge into clinical practice.

25687091|t|A Systems Biology Perspective on the Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Therapeutic Effects of Buyang Huanwu Decoction on Ischemic Stroke.
25687091|a|Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide. The outcome is worse in older patients, especially in terms of disability. Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD), a famous traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been used extensively in the treatment of ischemic stroke for centuries. However, its pharmacological mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, 82 putative targets for 411 composite compounds contained in BHD were predicted on the basis of our previously developed target prediction system. On the basis of large-scale molecular docking, more than 80% compound-putative target pairs had medium to strong binding efficiency. The pharmacological networks of BHD were built according to relationships among herbs, putative targets, and known therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke, and 121 major nodes were identified by calculating three topological features-degree, node betweenness, and closeness. Importantly, the pathway enrichment analysis identified several signaling pathways involved with major putative targets of BHD, such as the calcium signaling pathway, vascular smooth muscle contraction, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway, which have not hitherto been reported. These data are expected to help find new therapeutic effects of BHD and optimize clinical use of this formula. Collectively, our study developed a comprehensive systems approach integrating drug target prediction and network and functional analyses to reveal the relationships of the herbs in BHD with their putative targets, and for the first time with ischemic stroke-related pathway systems. This is a pilot study based on bioinformatics analysis; thus, further experimental studies are required to validate our findings.

26571884|t|[The effect of the acupuncture intervention of dredging Governor Vessel and regulating mentality for the medication treatment of post-stroke depression].
26571884|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the differences in onset time and the overall efficacy of the acupuncture therapy of dredging Governor Vessel and regulating mentality combined with fluoxetine and the fluoxetine for post-stroke depression(PSD). METHODS: Sixty-three patients were randomly divided into an acupuncture intervention of dredging Governor Vessel and regulating mentality group(acupuncture and medication group, 33 cases) and a control group (medication group, 30 cases). In the medication group, 20 mg fluoxetine was used by oral administration, once a day at 7:00 in the morning, continuously for 4 weeks. In the acupuncture and medication group, based on the oral administration of fluoxetine, the acupuncture intervention of dredging Governor Vessel and regulating mentality was applied mainly at Baihui(GV 20), Fengfu(GV 16), Shenting(GV 24), Shuigou(GV 26), Dazhui(GV 14) and Shendao(GV 11), once a day, 6 times a week, continuously for 4 weeks. Twenty-four items in Hamilton Depression Scale(HAMD), modified Edinburgh Scandinavia Stroke Scale(MESSS) and activity of daily life scale(ADL, Barthel index, BI) were used before and after 2-week and 4-week treatment. The efficacy was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: After 2-week treatment, the HAMD score and the MESSS score in the acupuncture and medication group were obviously decreased and the BI score was apparently increased(all P<0. 01). In the medication group, however, the score of every scale was not statistically different from that before treatment(P'>0. 05). After 4-week treatment, HAMD scores and MESSS scores in the two groups were obviously decreased and the BI scores I were apparently increased(all P<0. 01). After 2-week and 4-week treatment, the HAMD scores and the MESSS scores in the acupuncture and medication group were lower than those in the medication group and the BI scores were higher than those in the medication group(P<0. 01, P<0. 05). The total effective rate of anti-depression (97. 0%, 32/33) the total effective rate of nerve function impairment(90. 9%, 30/33) and the total effective rate of daily life activity(97. 0% 32/33) in the acupuncture and medication group were better than 80. 0% (24/30), 80. 0%(24/30), 83. 3%(25/30) in the medication group(all P<0. 05). CONCLUSION: The acupuncture therapy of dredging Governor Vessel and regulating mentality could reduce the onset time of anti-depression medicine treatment of PSD and enhance the overall efficacy. Therefore, it enhances the clinical compliance.

25328135|t|Myocyte enhancer factor 2C regulation of hepatocellular carcinoma via vascular endothelial growth factor and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
25328135|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading malignancies worldwide. Myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) was traditionally regarded as a development-associated factor and was recently reported to be an oncogene candidate. We have previously reported overexpression of MEF2C in HCC; however, the roles of MEF2C in HCC remain to be clarified. In this study, HCC cell lines and a xenograft mouse model were used to determine the functions of MEF2C in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Specific plasmids and small interfering RNA were used to upregulate and downregulate MEF2C expression, respectively. Functional assays were performed to assess the influence of MEF2C on cell proliferation, and VEGF-induced vasculogenic mimicry, migration/invasion as well as angiogenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation was conducted to identify the interaction of MEF2C and β-catenin. Human HCC tissue microarrays were used to investigate correlations among MEF2C, β-catenin and involved biomarkers. MEF2C was found to mediate VEGF-induced vasculogenic mimicry, angiogenesis and migration/invasion, with involvement of the p38 MAPK and PKC signaling pathways. However, MEF2C itself inhibited tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. MEF2C was upregulated by and directly interacted with β-catenin. The nuclear translocation of β-catenin blocked by MEF2C was responsible for MEF2C-mediated growth inhibition. The nuclear translocation of MEF2C was associated with intracellular calcium signaling induced by β-catenin. HCC microarrays showed correlations of nuclear MEF2C with the angiogenesis-associated biomarker, CD31, and cytosolic MEF2C with the proliferation-associated biomarker, Ki-67. MEF2C showed double-edged activities in HCC, namely mediating VEGF-induced malignancy enhancement while inhibiting cancer proliferation via blockade of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The overall effect of MEF2C in HCC progression regulation was dictated by its subcellular distribution. This should be determined prior to any MEF2C-associated intervention in HCC.

25827654|t|Resistance training improves hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, highly prevalent among nonelderly, nondiabetic, chronically disabled stroke patients.
25827654|a|OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of 8 weeks of lower body resistance training on hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, which may be prevalent among nonelderly, nondiabetic, chronically disabled stroke patients. DESIGN: Randomized controlled study. SETTING: Outpatient clinics of rehabilitation centers. PARTICIPANTS: Nonelderly, nondiabetic, chronically disabled stroke subjects (N=56) were enrolled and randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=28) and a control group (n=28). INTERVENTIONS: Lower body resistance training was performed by subjects in the experimental group 3 times a week for 8 weeks. The control group was given duration-matched stretch exercises. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting glucose level, fasting insulin level, 2-hour blood glucose level during oral glucose tolerance test, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A1c), total triglyceride level, total cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, body mass index, lower limb muscle strength, and Fugl-Meyer motor score. RESULTS: Before the intervention, 34 subjects (60.7%) had hyperglycemia and 38 (67.9%) had dyslipidemia. Fifty-one subjects finished the study. Subjects in the experimental group (n=26) showed significant improvements in fasting insulin and 2-hour blood glucose levels; HOMA-IR; total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol levels; and muscle strength compared with control subjects (n=25) after the intervention (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Resistance training may play a significant role in improving hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, which are frequently present among nonelderly, nondiabetic, chronically disabled stroke patients.

25829099|t|Whether Metal Element-Containing Herbal Formula Angong Niuhuang Pill Is Safe for Acute Brain Disorders?
25829099|a|"Angong Niuhuang Pill" (AGNH Pill) has been used as patented herbal formula for treatment of acute brain disorders including ischemic stroke, hemorrhage stroke, and trauma brain injury in traditional Chinese medicine for a thousand years. It is widely used in treatment of many diseases. As AGNH Pill contains metal elements named realgar and cinnabar, whether AGNH Pill is safe attracts great concerns. To address this question, we reviewed adverse drug reactions (ADR) and adverse events (AE) to assess the safety of AGNH Pill clinically. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, TOXNET, and Chinese databases CNKI and Wanfang for articles published between January 1974 and January 2015. A total of 49 cases contained in 10 articles were included in this study. We were unable to determine the frequency of ADR/AE induced by AGNH Pill due to the lack of complete production and market information provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers and hospitals. Based on current literature data, we estimated that the risk of ADR/AE from AGNH Pill administration was low. The majority of ADR/AE was attributed to the improper use of AGNH Pill, such as use in children with overdosage or use with incompatible drugs. We were unable to distinguish whether incidents were ADR or AE because of the poor reports. To date, published evidence indicates that AGNH Pill appears to carry a relatively low risk of ADR/AE. As the quality of clinical assessment for the safety of AGNH Pill is poor, it is desirable to conduct well-designed randomized clinical trials to assess its safety for the treatment of acute brain disorders.

25716336|t|Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Thrombolysis for the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Saccular Intracranial Aneurysms of ≤3 mm.
25716336|a|To explore the effectiveness and safety of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in treating acute ischemic stroke patients with concomitant intracranial aneurysms (IA) of ≤3 mm. Clinical data of patients who were treated in Tianjin Huanhu Hospital from June 2012 to September 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into the following groups: (a) IVT group, in which there were 30 acute ischemic stroke patients with IA of ≤3 mm and 30 patients without aneurysms; and (b) IA group, in which there were 30 patients who did not receive IVT and 30 patients who received IVT. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, case-fatality, and good outcome rate was compared within these two groups. Inside the IVT group, the incidence of systematic intracranial hemorrhage and case-fatality showed no significant differences between patients with concomitant IA and those without IA. The 3-month good outcome rate was also not significantly different (24 [80.0 %] vs. 27 [90 %]; P = 0.278). In IA group, patients who had received IVT showed significantly superior good outcome rate than those who had not received IVT (24 [80.0 %] vs. 16 [53.3 %]; P = 0.028).The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and case-fatality rate were not significantly different between these two subgroups as well. IVT is effective and safe method for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients with saccular IA of ≤3 mm.

25492947|t|Dynamic analysis of blood pressure changes in progressive cerebral infarction.
25492947|a|BACKGROUND: Progressive cerebral infarction is one of the leading causes of high disability and lethality for stroke patients. However, the association between progression of BP changes and cerebral infarction is not currently well understood. METHODS: We analyzed the dynamic changes in the BP of patients with acute ischemic stroke and explored the correlation between BP change and cerebral infarction progression. RESULTS: 30.9% (30/97) of the patients investigated developed to progressive cerebral infarction 17-141 h after admission. The percentage of patients with a long history of hypertension was significantly higher in the progressive group than in the non-progressive group. The mean systolic BP of the patients 16 h to 5 d after admission was also much higher in the progressive group. A greater abnormality of circadian blood pressure was also observed among patients in the progressive group. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension history of more than 5 years is an important risk factor for progressive cerebral infarction. Both the elevation of systolic blood pressure 16 h to 5 d after admission and abnormal circadian blood pressure are associated with the disease progression.

25890854|t|Effect of the -148C/T, 448G/A, and -854G/A Polymorphisms of the β-Fibrinogen Gene on the Risk of Ischemic Stroke in Chinese Population.
25890854|a|BACKGROUND: Several investigations have been performed to examine the influence of the β-fibrinogen (FGβ) gene polymorphisms on the risk of ischemic stroke, but the results of these studies are controversial. Our study aimed at investigating whether the FGβ gene (-148 C/T, 448 G/A, and -854 G/A) polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility to ischemic stroke by conducting meta-analysis. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified from 4 Chinese databases, PUBMED and EMBASE before May 30, 2014. The strength of association was evaluated by the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Inconsistency index and the Cochran's Q statistic were used to check heterogeneity. Publication bias was tested using funnel plots and Egger's regression test. RESULTS: Thirty-two independent studies with 4311 cases and 4124 controls were included. Significant association between -148 C/T polymorphism and the risk of ischemic stroke was found in overall analysis and middle-age, but not in young adults and elderly people. Similarly, association was also observed for -854 G/A polymorphism, especially in cerebral arterial main trunk infarction (MCI) and cerebral penetrating arterial infarction (PCI). However, no significance was found between 448 G/A polymorphism and ischemic stroke in Chinese people; likewise, no evidence of a significant association was observed when stratified according to the subtype of ischemic stroke (MCI and PCI). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that -148 C/T and -854 G/A polymorphisms probably contribute to susceptibility of ischemic stroke.

25904285|t|Complexity Analysis of Beat-to-Beat Skin-Surface Laser-Doppler Flowmetry Signals in Stroke Patients.
25904285|a|OBJECTIVES: This study performed skin-surface LDF measurements and SampEn analysis with the aims of (i) capturing the temporal complexity of cerebral hemodynamics in stroke patients and (ii) discriminating stroke patients from healthy control subjects. We also investigated the response induced by AS in beat-to-beat SampEn indexes of LDF signals. METHODS: LDF signals were obtained at bilateral TaiYang acupoints in 52 stroke patients. Each assessment involved a 20-minute baseline recording, a 20-minute AS, and a subsequent 20-minute recording. The FDT, FRT, and PW were calculated for each pulse of the LDF signals, and then their SampEn values were calculated. RESULTS: The SampEn values of FRT were significantly larger in the stroke group (1.064 ± 0.052 and p = 0.013 at the stroke side; 1.059 ± 0.055 and p = 0.017 at the controlateral side) than in the control group (0.975 ± 0.120). On the stroke side, the SampEn of value of FRT was significantly decreased following AS (1.064 ± 0.052 to 1.008 ± 0.060; p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Larger SampEn values of FRT can be partly attributed to the local regulatory activities that are present in the stroke subjects when facing the induced abnormal vascular conditions and blood flow perfusion resistance. The present findings could aid the development of a noninvasive monitoring technique that will enable discrimination of the different microcirculatory responses in stroke patients.

25815894|t|Ameliorative effects of Gualou Guizhi decoction on inflammation in focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury.
25815894|a|Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) is a well-established Traditional Chinese Medicinal formulation which has long been used to treat stroke in a clinical setting in China. The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of GLGZD on inflammation in focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was employed. Rats were administrated GLGZD (7.2 and 14.4 g/kg per day) or saline as control 2 h after reperfusion and daily over the following seven days. Neurological deﬁcit score and screen test were evaluated at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after MCAO. Brain infarct size and brain histological changes were observed via 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and regular hematoxylin & eosin staining. Furthermore, inflammation mediators and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were investigated using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. GLGZD treatment significantly improved neurological function, ameliorated histological changes to the brain and decreased infarct size in focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury. GLGZD was found to significantly reduce interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor-α and NF-κB levels, while increasing levels of IL-10. In conclusion, the present study suggested that GLGZD has a neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury and this effect is likely to be associated with the anti-inflammatory function of GLGZD.

25815607|a|The present study aimed to estimate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of Gualou Guizhi granules (GLGZG) in normal rats and in rat models of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and to examine the neuroprotective effects of GLGZG. A sensitive high‑performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry analytical method was developed to determinate the components of GLGZG in the plasma and brain tissue. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats served as a model of in vivo I/R. Citrulline, gallic acid, albiflorin, peoniflorin, liquiritin apioside, liquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside, isoliquiritin, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin and glycyrrhizinic acid rapidly passed into the bloodstream. Citrulline, albiflorin, peoniflorin, liquiritin apioside, liquiritin, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin and glycyrrhizinic acid also passed the BBB and reached the brain tissue of MCAO rats, while isoliquiritigenin and glycyrrhizinic acid were not detected in the brain tissue of the normal rats. The potential neuroprotective effect of GLGZG was determined in MCAO rats. The intragastric administration of GLGZG following reperfusion of rats for 2 h decreased the neurological defects and infarction volume, attenuated pathological changes of brain tissue and exerted a significant protective effect in cerebral ischemia injury. In conclusion, certain components of GLGZG passed through the BBB, particularly following cerebral ischemia injury, and this may be therapeutically effective for the treatment of cerebral ischemia injury in the human brain.

25815521|t|Anti-inflammatory effects of Gualou Guizhi decoction in transient focal cerebral ischemic brains. [Corrected].
25815521|a|The aim of the present study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: Sham (no MCAO), MCAO (MCAO with no GLGZD treatment) and GLGZD (MCAO with GLGZD treatment). Rats in the MCAO and GLGZD groups were subjected to permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Neurological function and infarct volume were measured. Microglial activation and inflammatory cell accumulation were measured using immunohistochemistry. mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory mediators were examined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of proteins associated with the nuclear factor κ-B (NF-κB) inflammation signaling pathway was analyzed using western blotting. The results of the present study suggested that infarct size was significantly reduced and neurological behavior function was improved in rats with MCAO treated with GLGZD compared with rats in the MCAO group. Amoeboid microglial expansion and inflammatory cell migration were observed in the infarcted areas of rats in the GLGZD group and were not identified in those of the MCAO group. Target mRNA and protein levels, and inflammatory cell infiltration were significantly reduced in the GLGZD group compared with the MCAO model group. Notably, GLGZD treatment induced neuroprotective effects, reducing inflammation and inhibiting NF-κB signaling compared with the MCAO group. Therefore, GLGZD may exhibit anti-inﬂammatory effects against ischemia-reperfusion brain injury and may be a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.

25649278|t|Anemoside A3 Enhances Cognition through the Regulation of Synaptic Function and Neuroprotection.
25649278|a|Compounds that have the ability to both strengthen synaptic function and facilitate neuroprotection are valuable cognitive enhancers that may improve health and quality of life, as well as retard age-related cognitive deterioration. Medicinal plants are an abundant source of potential cognitive enhancers. Here we report that anemoside A3 (AA3) isolated from Pulsatilla chinensis modulates synaptic connectivity in circuits central to memory enhancement. AA3 specifically modulates the function of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) by increasing serine phosphorylation within the GluA1 subunit, which is a modification required for the trafficking of GluA1-containing AMPARs to synapses. Furthermore, AA3 administration activates several synaptic signaling molecules and increases protein expressions of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor and monoamine neurotransmitters in the mouse hippocampus. In addition to acting through AMPARs, AA3 also acts as a non-competitive NMDA receptor (NMDAR) modulator with a neuroprotective capacity against ischemic brain injury and overexcitation in rats. These findings collectively suggest that AA3 possesses a unique ability to modulate the functions of both AMPARs and NMDARs. Concordantly, behavioral studies indicate that AA3 not only facilitates hippocampal long-term potentiation but also enhances spatial reference memory formation in mice. These multifaceted roles suggest that AA3 is an attractive candidate for further development as a cognitive enhancer capable of alleviating memory dysfunctions associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

26077459|t|The effect of a therapeutic regimen of Traditional Chinese Medicine rehabilitation for post-stroke cognitive impairment: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
26077459|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) lessens quality of life, restricts the rehabilitation of stroke, and increases the social and economic burden stroke imposes on patients and their families. Therefore effective treatment is of paramount importance. However, the treatment of PSCI is very limited. The primary aim of this protocol is to propose a lower cost and more effective therapy, and to confirm the long-term effectiveness of a therapeutic regimen of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) rehabilitation for PSCI. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective, multicenter, large sample, randomized controlled trial will be conducted. A total of 416 eligible patients will be recruited from seven inpatient and outpatient stroke rehabilitation units and randomly allocated into a therapeutic regimen of TCM rehabilitation group or cognitive training (CT) control group. The intervention period of both groups will last 12 weeks (30 minutes per day, five days per week). Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline, 12 weeks (at the end of the intervention), and 36 weeks (after the 24-week follow-up period). DISCUSSION: This protocol presents an objective design of a multicenter, large sample, randomized controlled trial that aims to put forward a lower cost and more effective therapy, and confirm the long-term effectiveness of a therapeutic regimen of TCM rehabilitation for PSCI through subjective and objective assessments, as well as highlight its economic advantages. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (identifier: ChiCTR-TRC-14004872 ) on 23 June 2014.

26059793|t|Levo-tetrahydropalmatine attenuates mouse blood-brain barrier injury induced by focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion: Involvement of Src kinase.
26059793|a|The restoration of blood flow following thrombolytic therapy causes ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury leading to blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and subsequent brain edema in patients of ischemic stroke. Levo-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP) occurs in Corydalis genus and some other plants. However, whether l-THP exerts protective role on BBB disruption following cerebral I/R remains unclear. Male C57BL/6N mice (23 to 28 g) were subjected to 90 min middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by reperfusion for 24 h. l-THP (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) was administrated by gavage 60 min before ischemia. We found I/R evoked Evans blue extravasation, albumin leakage, brain water content increase, cerebral blood flow decrease, cerebral infarction and neurological deficits, all of which were attenuated by l-THP treatment. Meanwhile, l-THP inhibited tight junction (TJ) proteins down-expression, Src kinase phosphorylation, matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 (MMP-2/9) and caveolin-1 activation. In addition, surface plasmon resonance revealed binding of l-THP to Src kinase with high affinity. Then we found Src kinase inhibitor PP2 could attenuate Evans blue dye extravasation and inhibit the caveolin-1, MMP-9 activation, occludin down-expression after I/R, respectively. In conclusion, l-THP attenuated BBB injury and brain edema, which were correlated with inhibiting the Src kinase phosphorylation.

25937634|t|Deciphering the pharmacological mechanism of the Chinese formula huanglian-jie-du decoction in the treatment of ischemic stroke using a systems biology-based strategy.
25937634|a|AIM: Huanglian-jie-du decoction (HLJDD) is an important multiherb remedy in TCM, which is recently demonstrated to be effective to treat ischemic stroke. Here, we aimed to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of HLJDD in the treatment of ischemic stroke using systems biology approaches. METHODS: Putative targets of HLJDD were predicted using MetaDrug. An interaction network of putative HLJDD targets and known therapeutic targets for the treatment of ischemic stroke was then constructed, and candidate HLJDD targets were identified by calculating topological features, including 'Degree', 'Node-betweenness', 'Closeness', and 'K-coreness'. The binding efficiencies of the candidate HLJDD targets with the corresponding compositive compounds were further validated by a molecular docking simulation. RESULTS: A total of 809 putative targets were obtained for 168 compositive compounds in HLJDD. Additionally, 39 putative targets were common to all four herbs of HLJDD. Next, 49 major nodes were identified as candidate HLJDD targets due to their network topological importance. The enrichment analysis based on the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation system and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway demonstrated that candidate HLJDD targets were more frequently involved in G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions and gap junctions, which all played important roles in the progression of ischemic stroke. Finally, the molecular docking simulation showed that 170 pairs of chemical components and candidate HLJDD targets had strong binding efficiencies. CONCLUSION: This study has developed for the first time a comprehensive systems approach integrating drug target prediction, network analysis and molecular docking simulation to reveal the relationships between the herbs contained in HLJDD and their putative targets and ischemic stroke-related pathways.

25937632|t|DanHong injection dose-dependently varies amino acid metabolites and metabolic pathways in the treatment of rats with cerebral ischemia.
25937632|a|AIM: To determine how the relative amino acid contents and metabolic pathways regulate the pharmacological phenotypes in rats with cerebral ischemia after treatment with varying doses of DanHong injection (DHI). METHODS: Adult male rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and were injected with DHI (DH-1: 1 mL/kg; DH-2: 2.5 mL/kg; DH-3: 5 mL/kg, and DH-4: 10 mL/kg, iv) daily for 3 d. The neurological deficit score, body weights and infarct volume were assessed. Serum levels of 20 free amino acids were determined using HPLC, and the values were transformed through the quantitative analysis of the amino acids in the serum metabolic spectrum. Multivariate statistical analysis methods (PCA and PLS-DA) and web-based metabolomics tools (MetPa and MetaboAnalyst) were used to analyze the biological data sets for the amino acids. RESULTS: Administration of DHI dose-dependently decreased cerebral infarct volume, and ameliorated neurological deficits. A total of 5, 6, 7 and 7 non-overlapping metabolites were identified in the DH-1, DH-2, DH-3, and DH-4 groups, respectively. Eight metabolites were shared between the DHI groups and the vehicle group. In addition, the serum levels of glutamic acid, aspartic acid and serine increased with increasing DHI dose. A total of 3, 2, 2 and 5 non-overlapping metabolic pathways were identified in the DH-1, DH-2, DH-3 and DH-4 groups, respectively, and glycine, serine, threonine and histidine metabolism were identified as overlapping pathways among the 4 dose groups. CONCLUSION: Overlapping and non-overlapping amino acid metabolites and metabolic pathways are associated with the dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of DHI.

25828908|t|Effectiveness of acupuncture combined with rehabilitation for treatment of acute or subacute stroke: a systematic review.
25828908|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the combination of acupuncture and rehabilitation produces better results in the treatment of acute or subacute stroke sequelae than rehabilitation alone. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out. A search was conducted in March 2014 using PubMed, Medline, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI) and Wanfang databases. English and Chinese language articles published within 10 years of the search were reviewed for inclusion. Randomised control trials comparing combined treatment with acupuncture and rehabilitation and rehabilitation alone in patients with acute or subacute stroke (onset until 3 months after stroke) were included in this review. Three review authors independently checked the titles and abstracts of trials for inclusion based on selection criteria. Studies measuring changes of motor function, activities of daily living, neurological deficit or spasticity/range of motion during the treatment period and at the end of follow-up were included. RESULTS: 17 trials met the inclusion criteria, of which five were of good quality. 14 trials had results favourable to acupuncture combined with rehabilitation, compared with conventional rehabilitation treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture in combination with rehabilitation may have benefits for the treatment of acute and subacute stroke sequelae in comparison with rehabilitation alone. However, many of the studies were at risk of bias. Future studies should focus on reaching a consensus about the most appropriate modality of acupuncture intervention, and the appropriate length of treatment for both interventions, to maximise the potential synergistic outcomes.

26136945|t|Antioxidant and anti-excitotoxicity effect of Gualou Guizhi decoction on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.
26136945|a|Stroke is the leading cause of disability in adults and the second most common cause of mortality worldwide. There is currently intense interest in the use of natural products in the treatment of the condition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) on rats subjected to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and the possible mechanisms involved. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced by the middle cerebral artery occlusion method. Ischemic injury was assessed by estimating neurological function and measuring brain infarct volume, and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling method was employed to examine ischemia-induced apoptosis. The levels of the antioxidative enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the concentrations of the non-enzymatic scavenger glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured to investigate the antioxidant mechanisms. In addition, the levels of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) and glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) were examined using an automatic amino acid analyzer and immunohistochemical analysis. The administration of GLGZD attenuated the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced neural deficits and cerebral infarct volume, reduced the levels of MDA and EAAs (glutamate and aspartate), significantly increased the activity of the antioxidant GSH and notably elevated the activity of SOD. Consistently, GLGZD inhibited ischemia-induced apoptosis and downregulated the expression of GluR1. In conclusion, this study suggested that GLGZD exerts a neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through the modulation of multiple antioxidant and anti-excitotoxicity pathways.

26261541|t|Qiliqiangxin improves cardiac function and attenuates cardiac remodeling in rats with experimental myocardial infarction.
26261541|a|OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that Qiliqiangxin (QL), a traditional Chinese medicine compound, could inhibit cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, and improve cardiac function. However, whether and how it reverses cardiac remodeling in rats post myocardial infarction (MI) remains unknown. This study aims to explore related mechanisms linked with cardiac function improvement and attenuation of cardiac remodeling by QL in rats with experimental MI. METHODS: MI was induced by ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats with LVEF < 50% at four weeks after procedure were treated for another 6 weeks with placebo, QL and captopril. Echocardiography and plasma NT-proBNP were measured at the end of study, and histological studies were performed. Protein expressions of Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), total-Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), hydroxy-HIF-1α (Pro564), VEGF, Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase 3 were examined by Western blot. mRNA expression of NRG-1 and p53 was detected by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, QL improved cardiac function, reduced left ventricular dimension, inhibited interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, increased neovascularization, and attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Meanwhile QL significantly upregulated the expression of HIF-1α, VEGF, enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, decreased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and Caspase 3 expression. Furthermore, we observed upregulation of NRG-1 and downregulation of p53 after QL treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the beneficial effects of QL on improving cardiac function and attenuating cardiac remodeling post MI are associated with angiogenesis enhancement and apoptosis inhibition, which may be mediated via activation of NRG-1/Akt signaling and suppression of p53 pathway.

25672910|t|Naotaifang extract treatment results in increased ferroportin expression in the hippocampus of rats subjected to cerebral ischemia.
25672910|a|The expression of Ferroportin (Fpn) was examined at different time points in rats following focal cerebral ischemia treated with or without the traditional Chinese medicine Naotaifang. Initially, rats were randomly divided into 2, 6, 12, 24 and 72 h groups following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and the mRNA and protein level of Fpn was detected by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) at the above time points. Secondly, the rats were randomly divided into five groups as follows: Sham surgery group, model group, low‑dose group (3 g/kg NTE), medium dose group (9 g/kg NTE) and the high‑dose group (27 g/kg NTE). After 3 days of corresponding therapy by intragastric administration once a day, the regional cerebral ischemia model was reproduced by the MCAO suture method. On the third day, the neurological behavior of the rats was analyzed by neurobehavioral assessment. Fpn in the hippocampal CA2 region was measured by immunohistochemistry and the mRNA level of Fpn was detected by RT‑PCR. Expression of Fpn in the hippocampal CA2 region reached a peak 12 h after surgery (P<0.05, compared with the model group). The high‑dose group (27 g/kg NTE) exhibited a lower neurological behavior score (P<0.05) and a higher level of expression of Fpn at the mRNA and protein level compared with the sham surgery group and model group (P<0.05). Dysregulation of intracellular iron balance is possibly a new mechanism underlying cerebral ischemia. NTE can protect the neuronal population in the hippocampal CA2 region by adjusting the expression of Fpn to balance iron levels following cerebral ischemia.

25891842|t|Safety of the direct-acting anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation: a meta-analysis.
25891842|a|INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is known as one of the independent risk factors for stroke and might significantly increase its risk. Nowadays, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed and demonstrated a more promising option to warfarin, the conclusion for safety is heterogeneous in different studies. It indicates the importance of comprehensive comparison of safety between DOACs and warfarin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four studies including ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, RE-LY and ROCKET-AF were included in the meta-analysis to perform separate meta-analyses for high-dose regimen, low-dose regimen and their combination. The events included major bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, non-major clinically relevant and minor bleeding. RESULTS: Regardless of high dose or low dose regimen, DOACs were associated with lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage but due to no significant association for gastrointestinal bleeding, the overall effect measured by the major bleeding was also insignificant (High dose: RR=0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; Low dose: RR=0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.04). However, the combined result of high-dose and low-dose regimens showed DOACs were associated with lower risk of major bleeding events (RR=0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analyses have showed the comparative safety of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants than warfarin in most endpoints and even better in intracranial haemorrhage. Therefore, without the need of INR monitoring, DOACs demonstrated promising alternatives to warfarin in prevention of stroke in patients with AF.

25800798|t|Alteration of glutamate/GABA balance during acute alcohol intoxication in rats: effect of Xingnaojing injection.
25800798|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xingnaojing Injection (XNJI) is a modern Chinese formula came from famous Chinese medicine An Gong Niu Huang Pill. XNJI has been used for treatment of cerebral diseases and stroke in China, and is approved by the State Food and Drug Administration of China for the treatment of acute alcohol intoxication (AAI). XNJI belongs to the ethnopharmacological family of medicines. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of the XNJI effect on AAI. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effects of XNJI on glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and related receptor in lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of AAI rat. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with microdialysis probes in LHA. Rats were randomly divided into control, model, 1.36mg/kg XNJI, 0.68mg/kg XNJI and 0.34mg/kg XNJI groups. During microdialysis, baseline samples were collected from 1h to 2.5h; thereafter, the rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of 52% ethanol, 5.2g/kg, or saline for control group. Twenty minutes later, three doses of XNJI was given by unilateral injection respectively, while saline for control and model groups, and samples were collected for the next 4h. The extracellular glutamate and GABA levels were measured in the LHA by a high performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLU). The expression levels of related receptors N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NR) subunit NR2A, NR2B and GABAA were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Ethanol (5.2g/kg) significantly decreased the extracellular levels of glutamate and increased extracellular GABA in LHA. On the other hand ethanol significantly decreased NR2A and NR2B mRNAs expression, and increase GABAA mRNA expression. XNJI could increase the extracellular level of glutamate and decrease that of GABA; moreover, induced an increase in NR2A and NR2B mRNA expression, and a decrease in GABAA mRNA expression in LHA. CONCLUSIONS: The current changes in glutamate, GABA and mRNA expressions of related receptors in LHA after injection of XNJI suggest that changes in these neurotransmitters and receptors as a potential mechanism of action for AAI.

25994188|t|Clinical assessment of Shenfu injection loading in the treatment of patients with exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to coronary heart disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
25994188|a|BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbation is a common cause of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure, and coronary heart disease is the most common cause. Shenfu injection, a Traditional Chinese Medicine injection, widely used in the adjuvant treatment of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, shows some treatment effect in improving the symptoms and the quality of life, but it lacks the rigorous clinical evaluation of research reports. This paper describes the protocol for the clinical assessment of Shenfu injection loading in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. METHODS: This protocol adopts the design of a prospective, randomized, multicenter, blind imitation, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Shenfu injection loading in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to coronary heart disease. The research will be carried out in 12 hospitals in China and is expected to enroll 160 inpatients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to coronary heart disease (yang and qi deficiency syndrome). On the basis of the conventional therapy of western medicine, patients will be randomized to either the treatment group (100 ml 5% glucose injection + 50 ml Shenfu injection) or the control group (150 ml 5% glucose injection) for 7 ± 1 days and follow-up for 28 ± 3 days. The primary outcomes are New York Heart Association cardiac function classification and Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes. The secondary outcomes are left ventricular ejection fraction, brain natriuretic peptide level, Lee's heart failure score, 6-minute walking distance, and the incidence and readmission rate of cardiovascular events (including the emergency rate due to acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure). DISCUSSION: This trial will assess the effect of loading Shenfu injection in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure caused by coronary heart disease (yang-qi deficiency syndrome) on the symptoms and signs of heart failure, exercise tolerance, and other aspects, and observe its influence on the short-term prognosis with follow-up. The results of the study will provide clinical research evidence for application of Shenfu injection in the treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on 26 December 2012 at the Chinese Clinical Trials Register (Identifier: ChiCTR-TRC-12002857 ).

26579457|t|Ginsenoside Rg1 protects against transient focal cerebral ischemic injury and suppresses its systemic metabolic changes in cerabral injury rats.
26579457|a|Ginsenoside Rg1 (GR), a major bioactive compound of traditional Chinese medicine, such as Panax ginseng or Radix Notoginseng, has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke. However, pharmacokinetic studies have suggested that GR could not be efficiently transported through the blood-brain barrier. The mechanism by which GR attenuates cerebral ischemic injury in vivo remains largely unknown. Therefore, this study explored potential neuro-protective effects of GR through its systemic metabolic regulating mechanism by using mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling. Rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were treated with GR intravenously. Their metabolic profiles in serum were measured by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry on 1 and 3 days after MCAO. GR exhibited a potent neuro-protective effect by significantly decreasing the neurological scores and infarct volume in the MCAO rats. Moreover, 18 differential metabolites were tentatively identified, all of which appeared to correlate well with these disease indices. Our findings suggested that GR carries a therapeutic potential in stroke possibly through a feed-back mechanism by regulating systematic metabolic mediation.

26136889|t|Ligustrazine reduces blood-brain barrier permeability in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
26136889|a|Ligustrazine, also known as 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), one of the major active compounds of Ligusticum wallichii Franchat., has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation and protect neurons during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, whether it reduces blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability during ischemic stroke is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role that TMP plays in protecting the BBB integrity in ischemia/reperfusion injury and to investigate the relevant mechanisms involved. Rats received an intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg TMP 15 min before the onset of ischemia, which was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volume, neurological score, brain edema, BBB permeability and tight junction protein impairment were observed. The results showed that TMP reduced the neurological score and levels of brain infarction and edema. In addition, TMP significantly decreased BBB permeability and prevented the impairment of occludin and claudin-5, two tight junction protein components of the BBB, in rat brains with ischemia/reperfusion injury. In addition, the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases, enzymes responsible for the degradation of the extracellular matrix and tight junctions, were reduced in the rat brains by TMP treatment. These results combined suggest that TMP reduces BBB permeability as well as neuronal damage in focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.

24485247|t|Ischemic stroke risk in a southeastern Chinese population: Insights from 5-lipoxygenase activating protein and phosphodiesterase 4D single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
24485247|a|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Through a genome-wide linkage scan, an Icelandic genetic research group identified two new genes associated with ischemic stroke: the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (ALOX5AP) gene and the phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene. Because they regulate arterial inflammation and are closely related to atherosclerosis and plaque instability, these two mutated genes have become a research hotspot. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the risk of ischemic stroke and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ALOX5AP and PDE4D genes in a southeastern Chinese population. METHODS: A total of 459 patients with stroke and 462 control individuals were recruited in the study. Four ALOX5AP SNPs (SG13S32, SG13S42, SG13S89, and SG13S114), and three PDE4D SNPs (SNP83, SNP87, and SNP45) were studied. SNP genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by allele-specific primer extension, with detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. Data were coded and entered in SPSS Windows (version 16.0). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analysis was applied to detect gene-gene interactions. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in the SNP genotype frequencies between cases and controls for the seven SNPs studied. GMDR analysis revealed no evidence of interactions between these seven polymorphic sites and an increased stroke risk. In addition, no association between different stroke types and the control group was detected. Results showed that only the ALOX5AP gene, and specifically the rs9551963 and rs4769060 genotypes, exhibited significantly different distributions between the stroke and control groups in female participants. CONCLUSION: No association was found between SNPs of ALOX5AP or PDE4D and the risk of overall ischemic stroke in a southeastern Chinese population. Interactions between these two genes were not risk factors for cerebral infarction. In atherothrombotic and small-artery disease subtypes, none of the seven SNPs was associated with any stroke risk; however, the ALOX5AP gene might be related to ischemic stroke incidence in females.

25813063|t|The hospital costs of stroke patients in Chinese island populations: an 11-year tendency analysis.
25813063|a|BACKGROUND: The impact of stroke is devastating the life of patients, families, and even the communities. The cost of treatment; however, has the tendency of increasing nowadays, which has brought a heavy burden to patients and their families. Our study aims to collect the data of the hospital cost among stroke patients in Chinese island populations over the past decade and provide the scientific improvement for stroke. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the basic information and hospital costs of the stroke patients in Dalian Changhai Hospital from 2003 to 2013 using the Information Registration System of Inpatient. RESULTS: The total cumulative hospital admissions for stroke in Dalian Changhai Hospital were 1367 and showed a rising tendency from 2003 to 2013. Our results illustrated that the annual cumulative hospital costs of stroke inpatients increased rapidly in the past 11 years (the average rise was 37.71% per year), and the mean hospital cost per admission was 1.66% higher than that before, when the mean length of hospital days showed a downward tendency. Medication cost was found to be the largest part in the overall hospital cost (as a high percentage of 73.94%); however, traditional Chinese medicine only occupied quite a small proportion in the medicines. CONCLUSIONS: The hospital cost for stroke in Dalian Changhai County has brought an increasingly heavy economic burden to the local government and residents.

26109950|t|Changes of resting cerebral activities in subacute ischemic stroke patients.
26109950|a|This study aimed to detect the difference in resting cerebral activities between ischemic stroke patients and healthy participants, define the abnormal site, and provide new evidence for pathological mechanisms, clinical diagnosis, prognosis prediction and efficacy evaluation of ischemic stroke. At present, the majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies focus on the motor dysfunction and the acute stage of ischemic stroke. This study recruited 15 right-handed ischemic stroke patients at subacute stage (15 days to 11.5 weeks) and 15 age-matched healthy participants. A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed on each subject to detect cerebral activity. Regional homogeneity analysis was used to investigate the difference in cerebral activities between ischemic stroke patients and healthy participants. The results showed that the ischemic stroke patients had lower regional homogeneity in anterior cingulate and left cerebrum and higher regional homogeneity in cerebellum, left precuneus and left frontal lobe, compared with healthy participants. The experimental findings demonstrate that the areas in which regional homogeneity was different between ischemic stroke patients and healthy participants are in the cerebellum, left precuneus, left triangle inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus and anterior cingulate. These locations, related to the motor, sensory and emotion areas, are likely potential targets for the neural regeneration of subacute ischemic stroke patients.

25765726|t|B-type natriuretic peptides help in cardioembolic stroke diagnosis: pooled data meta-analysis.
25765726|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Determining the underlying cause of stroke is important to optimize secondary prevention treatment. Increased blood levels of natriuretic peptides (B-type natriuretic peptide/N-terminal pro-BNP [BNP/NT-proBNP]) have been repeatedly associated with cardioembolic stroke. Here, we evaluate their clinical value as pathogenic biomarkers for stroke through a literature systematic review and individual participants' data meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched publications in PubMed database until November 2013 that compared BNP and NT-proBNP circulating levels among stroke causes. Standardized individual participants' data were collected to estimate predictive values of BNP/NT-proBNP for cardioembolic stroke. Dichotomized BNP/NT-proBNP levels were included in logistic regression models together with clinical variables to assess the sensitivity and specificity to identify cardioembolic strokes and the additional value of biomarkers using area under the curve and integrated discrimination improvement index. RESULTS: From 23 selected articles, we collected information of 2834 patients with a defined cause. BNP/NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated in cardioembolic stroke until 72 hours from symptoms onset. Predictive models showed a sensitivity >90% and specificity >80% when BNP/NT-proBNP were added considering the lowest and the highest quartile, respectively. Both peptides also increased significantly the area under the curve and integrated discrimination improvement index compared with clinical models. Sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the models were validated in 197 patients with initially undetermined stroke with final pathogenic diagnosis after ancillary follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Natriuretic peptides are strongly increased in cardioembolic strokes. Future multicentre prospective studies comparing BNP and NT-proBNP might aid in finding the optimal biomarker, the best time point, and the optimal cutoff points for cardioembolic stroke identification.

26159020|t|[Efficacy of Chinese Herbs for Supplementing Qi and Activating Blood Circulation on Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: a Clinical Observation].
26159020|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of Chinese herbs for supplementing qi and activating blood circulation (CHSQABC) on patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: In this ChiCTR-TRC-00000021, a total of 281 ACS patients complicated with type 2 DM after successful PCI were randomly assigned to the Western medicine treatment group (the control group, treated by routine Western medicine treatment) and the combined treatment group (the treatment group, treated by CHSQABC + routine Western medicine treatment). Patients in the combined treatment group took Xinyue Capsule (2 pills each time, 3 times per day) and Compound Chuanxiong Capsule (2 pills each time, 3 times per day for half a year and 1-year follow-ups). Primary endpoints covered incidence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia-driven revascularization, and secondary endpoints included stroke, heart failure, and rehospitalization for ACS. At the same time scores for blood stasis syndrome (BSS) and the incidence of angina pectoris were evaluated before treatment, at month 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after treatment. RESULTS: The incidence of ischemia-driven revascularization was obviously less in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.05). No patient had nonfatal MI in the treatment group, while 5 patients in the control group had it. The incidence of non-fatal MI showed an obvious lowering tendency in the treatment group, but with no statistical difference when compared with that in the control group (P > 0.05). Four patients readmitted to hospital in the treatment group, while 12 patients readmitted. There existed obvious tendency in the treatment group, but with no statistical difference when compared with that in the control group (P > 0.05). The incidence of angina was significantly lower in the treatment group at month 6, 9, and 12 than that at month 1 , but it was lower in the control group at 9 months (P < 0.05). The incidence of angina was 15. 4% in the treatment group, obviously lower than that in the control group (26.2%, P < 0.05). Compared with before treatment, scores for BSS were obviously lowered in the treatment group at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment and in the control group at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment (P < 0.05). It was obviously lower in the treatment group than in the control group at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Administration of CHSQABC combined routine Western medicine treatment could reduce the event of revascularization and post-PCI recurrent angina, and improve scores for BSS of ACS patients complicated with DM after PCI.

25925312|t|The efficacy and safety of the Chinese herbal medicine Di-Tan decoction for treating Alzheimer's disease: protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
25925312|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in the elderly. It is estimated that the global prevalence of dementia will rise from 24.3 million in 2005 to 81.1 million in 2040. AD has a devastating impact on sufferers, caregivers, their communities and the healthcare system in general. "Di-tan decoction" (DTD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula frequently used to treat symptoms that are now defined as AD in clinical treatment. However, the existing evidence for recommending DTD in clinical practice derives from studies that were methodologically flawed. In this study, we aim to determine the efficacy and safety of DTD in AD patients based on a rigidly randomized controlled trial. It will provide critical information on sample size and treatment regimen for conducting a full-scale clinical trial of DTD later. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a 2-week run-in period, eligible patients with mild to moderate AD will be recruited and given either DTD or placebo twice daily for 24 weeks with follow-up 6 weeks after the last treatment. An increase of four points or greater on the scores of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAD-cog) will be considered as a positive primary outcome. Total scores of the ADAD-cog, the Chinese version of Mini-Mental State Examination (C-MMSE), and the Chinese version of the Disability Assessment for Dementia (C-DAD) score will be used as secondary outcomes. Adverse events will also be reported. DISCUSSION: This randomized trial will be the first rigorous empirical study on the efficacy of DTD for treating cognitive symptoms in AD patients. Its success will justify and warrant a large-scale clinical trial to further consolidate the evidence for DTD's efficacy in treating AD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( ChiCTR-TRC-12004548 , Date of registration: 22 November 2012).

25698615|t|Senkyunolide I protects rat brain against focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by up-regulating p-Erk1/2, Nrf2/HO-1 and inhibiting caspase 3.
25698615|a|Oxidative damage and apoptosis are critical factors contributing to neuronal death during a stroke. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of senkyunolide I (SEI) on focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats, and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 2h, followed by 24h reperfusion, and then randomly assigned into four groups: Sham (sham-operated), Vehicle (tMCAO +normal saline), SEI-L (tMCAO +SEI 36 mg/kg) and SEI-H (tMCAO +SEI 72 mg/kg) groups. SEI was administered intravenously, 15 min after occlusion. Neurological deficit, brain edema and infarct volume were detected after 24h of reperfusion. Histological structures of cortices and hippocampus were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical indexes in the cortex were assayed by colorimetry. The impact of SEI on the Nrf2-ARE-interaction was assayed using a luciferase reporter gene. Western blotting was performed to analysis the expressions of proteins related to anti-oxidation and apoptosis. SEI administration significantly ameliorated the neurological deficit, reduced the infarct volume and brain edema, reversed the cerebral morphologic damage, decreased the levels of MDA and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase. Furthermore, the high dose SEI could significantly activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway by up-regulating the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and inducing Nrf2 nuclear translocation with enhanced HO-1 and NQO1 expressions. Additionally, treatment with SEI remarkably promoted the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and inhibited the expressions of cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9. These results suggest that the neuroprotective mechanisms of SEI are associated with its anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis properties.

25954164|t|Neuroprotective effects of DAHP and Triptolide in focal cerebral ischemia via apoptosis inhibition and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation.
25954164|a|Triptolide (TP), one of the major active components of the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, and 2, 4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP), an inhibitor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis, have been reported to have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. However, the protective effects of TP and DAHP on cerebral ischemia have not been reported yet. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of TP and DAHP in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. Furthermore, we examined whether the neuroprotective effects of TP and DAHP were associated with the inhibition of apoptosis through suppressing BH4 and inducible NOS (iNOS) synthesis or the activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/serine-threonine kinase Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway. Our results showed that pretreatments with TP (0.2 mg/kg) and DAHP (0.5 g/kg) significantly reduced ischemic lesion volume, water content, and neuronal cell death compared with the vehicle MCAO rats. In addition, compared with the MCAO group, TP, and DAHP pretreatment groups significantly reduced astrocyte numbers, caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and NF-κB up-regulation, while increased Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, protein expressions of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR increased, while extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2) phosphorylation decreased in both the TP-treated rats and DAHP-treated rats. These results demonstrate that TP and DAHP can decrease cell apoptosis in focal cerebral ischemia rat brains and that the mechanism may be related to the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and inactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Thus our hypothesis was reached PI3K/Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways may provide distinct cellular targets for a new generation of therapeutic agents for the treatment of stroke, and TP and DAHP may be potential neuroprotective agents for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

25897666|t|Methylophiopogonanone A Protects against Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury and Attenuates Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption In Vitro.
25897666|a|Methylophiopogonanone A (MO-A), an active homoisoflavonoid of the Chinese herb Ophiopogon japonicus which has been shown to have protective effects on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. However, little is known about its role in cerebral I/R injury. Therefore, in this study, by using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion rat model, the effect of MO-A on cerebral I/R injury was examined. The results showed that MO-A treatment reduced infarct volume and brain edema, improved neurological deficit scores, reversed animal body weight decreases, and increased animal survival time in the stroke groups. Western blotting showed that MO-A suppressed MMP-9, but restored the expression of claudin-3 and claudin-5. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy were monitored to determine the blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations in vitro. The results showed that MO-A markedly attenuated BBB damage in vitro. Additionally, MO-A inhibited ROS production in ECs and MMP-9 release in differentiated THP-1 cells in vitro, and suppressed ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in ECs and leukocyte/EC adhesion. In conclusion, our data indicate that MO-A has therapeutic potential against cerebral I/R injury through its ability to attenuate BBB disruption by regulating the expression of MMP-9 and tight junction proteins.

25875333|t|The microstructural status of the corpus callosum is associated with the degree of motor function and neurological deficit in stroke patients.
25875333|a|Human neuroimaging studies and animal models have suggested that white matter damage from ischemic stroke leads to the functional and structural reorganization of perilesional and remote brain regions. However, the quantitative relationship between the transcallosal tract integrity and clinical motor performance score after stroke remains unexplored. The current study employed a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the relationship between white matter diffusivity changes and the clinical scores in stroke patients. Probabilistic fiber tracking was also used to identify structural connectivity patterns in the patients. Thirteen ischemic stroke patients and fifteen healthy control subjects participated in this study. TBSS analyses showed that the corpus callosum (CC) and bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST) in the stroke patients exhibited significantly decreased fractional anisotropy and increased axial and radial diffusivity compared with those of the controls. Correlation analyses revealed that the motor and neurological deficit scores in the stroke patients were associated with the value of diffusivity indices in the CC. Compared with the healthy control group, probabilistic fiber tracking analyses revealed that significant changes in the inter-hemispheric fiber connections between the left and right motor cortex in the stroke patients were primarily located in the genu and body of the CC, left anterior thalamic radiation and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral CST, anterior/superior corona radiate, cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus, strongly suggesting that ischemic induces inter-hemispheric network disturbances and disrupts the white matter fibers connecting motor regions. In conclusion, the results of the present study show that DTI-derived measures in the CC can be used to predict the severity of motor skill and neurological deficit in stroke patients. Changes in structural connectivity pattern tracking between the left and right motor areas, particularly in the body of the CC, might reflect functional reorganization and behavioral deficit.

25669874|t|Validation of the use of B-type natriuretic peptide point-of-care test platform in preliminary recognition of cardioembolic stroke patients in the ED.
25669874|a|AIM: The aim of the study is to validate of the use of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) point-of-care test platform in preliminary recognition of cardioembolic stroke patients in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: In our ED, emergency physicians prospectively assessed consecutive adult patients with acute phase of ischemic stroke and measured plasma BNP by point-of-care test platform on admission. The included patients with plasma BNP concentration more than 66.50 pg/mL were presumed to be classified as the cardioembolism (CE) subtype and were then followed up. Stroke neurologists evaluated patients' functional outcome at hospital discharge and also made discharge diagnosis and stroke etiologic subtypes according to Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria: large artery atherosclerosis, CE, small artery occlusion, stroke of other determined etiology, and stroke of other undetermined etiology. RESULTS: In this study, 172 of 262 acute ischemic stroke patients met the study criteria (mean age, 71.18 ± 11.65 years; 53.49% female). Of the 172 patients, 38.95% were diagnosed with large artery atherosclerosis at discharge; 26.16%, with CE; 24.42%, with small artery occlusion; and 10.47%, with stroke of other determined etiology or stroke of other undetermined etiology. Age, previous cardiac disease, atrial fibrillation, length of hospital stays, Scandinavian Stroke Scale score on admission less than or equal to 25, and modified Rankin Scale greater than or equal to 3 or death at discharge were all significantly higher in the CE patients compared to other subtypes (P < .01). The mean BNP concentration was significantly higher in the CE group than in other 3 subtypes (P < .01). The plasma BNP level greater than 66.50 pg/mL had good corresponding diagnostic performance in preliminary recognition of cardioembolic stroke patients (sensitivity, 75.56%; specificity, 87.40%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that the plasma BNP level greater than 66.50 pg/mL as a reference index had good corresponding diagnostic performance in preliminary recognition of cardioembolic stroke patients. However, the single BNP biomarker panel cannot be used to confidently identify CE subtype as a diagnosis and must be taken in context with clinical assessment and judgment before making management decisions.

25698764|t|Risk of stroke among patients with post-traumatic stress disorder: nationwide longitudinal study.
25698764|a|BACKGROUND: Previous evidence has shown positive associations between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus, which are all risk factors for stroke, but the role of PTSD in the subsequent development of stroke is still unknown. AIMS: To investigate the temporal association between PTSD and the development of stroke. METHOD: Identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 5217 individuals aged ≥18 years, with PTSD but with no history of stroke, and 20 868 age- and gender-matched controls were enrolled between 2002 and 2009, and followed up until the end of 2011 to identify the development of stroke. RESULTS: Individuals with PTSD had an increased risk of developing any stroke (hazard ratio (HR) 3.37, 95% CI 2.44-4.67) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 3.47, 95% CI 2.23-5.39) after adjusting for demographic data and medical comorbidities. Sensitivity tests showed consistent findings (any stroke HR = 3.02, 95% CI 2.13-4.28; ischaemic stroke HR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.79-4.66) after excluding the first year of observation. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with PTSD have an increased risk of developing any stroke and ischaemic stroke. Further studies are required to investigate the underlying mechanisms.

25410304|t|Identification of circulating microRNAs as potential biomarkers for detecting acute ischemic stroke.
25410304|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are present in serum and have the potential to serve as disease biomarkers. As such, it is important to explore the clinical value of miRNAs in serum as biomarkers for ischemic stroke (IS) and cast light on the pathogenesis of IS. In this study, we screened differentially expressed serum miRNAs from IS and normal people by miRNA microarray analysis, and validated the expression of candidate miRNAs using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. Furthermore, we performed gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses to disclose functional enrichment of genes predicted to be regulated by the differentially expressed miRNAs. Notably, our results revealed that 115 miRNAs were differentially expressed in IS, among which miR-32-3p, miR-106-5p, and miR-532-5p were first found to be associated with IS. In addition, GO and KEGG pathway analyses showed that genes predicted to be regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs were significantly enriched in several related biological process and pathways, including axon guidance, glioma, MAPK signaling, mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, and ErbB-signaling pathway. In conclusion, we identified the changed expression pattern of miRNAs in IS. Serum miR-32-3p, miR-106-5p, miR-1246, and miR-532-5p may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for IS. Our results also demonstrate a novel role for miRNAs in the pathogenesis of IS.

25847568|t|Wen Dan Decoction for hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke.
25847568|a|OBJECTIVE: The use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in stroke is increasing worldwide. Here we report the existing clinical evidence of the Pinellia Ternata containing formula Wen Dan Decoction (WDD) for the treatment of ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. METHODS: PubMed, CNKI, Wan Fang database, Cochrane Library and online Clinical Trial Registry were searched up to 26 February 2013 for randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) using WDD as intervention versus Western conventional medicine as control to treat stroke. Clinical outcomes were improvement of the Neurological Functional Deficit Scores (NFDS) and overall therapeutic efficacy rates including rate of cure. Meta-regression analysis using Hedges'g was performed for RCTs with significant heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 22 RCTs of ischemic stroke and 4 RCTs of hemorrhagic stroke, involving 2214 patients (1167 used WDD), met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of the 13 RCTs reporting NFDS improvement favored WDD over the control (mean difference=-3.40, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=[-4.64, -2.15]). Rate of overall therapeutic efficacy (odds ratio [OR]=3.39, 95%CI=[1.81, 6.37]) for hemorrhagic stroke were significantly higher in WDD treated patients than the control subjects. In the 1898 patients with ischemic stroke, WDD medication also achieved higher rates of cure (OR=2.22, 95%CI=[1.66, 2.97]) and overall therapeutic efficacy (OR=3.31, 95%CI=[2.54, 4.31]) than the conventional treatment. CONCLUSIONS: WDD displays benefits on improvement of neurological function and overall therapeutic efficacy in post-stroke patients. TCM such as WDD may serve as a therapeutic tool of dual actions to explore the common mechanisms underlying cerebral hemorrhage and ischemia.

25710597|t|Chemical profiling and quantification of Gua-Lou-Gui-Zhi decoction by high performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry.
25710597|a|Gua-Lou-Gui-Zhi decoction (GLGZD) is a classical formula of traditional Chinese medicine, which has been commonly used to treat dysfunction after stroke, epilepsy and spinal cord injury. In this study, a systematic method was established for chemical profiling and quantification analysis of the major constituents in GLGZD. For qualitative analysis, a method of high performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS) was developed. 106 compounds, including monoterpene glycosides, galloyl glucoses, phenolic acids, flavonoids, gingerols and triterpene saponins were identified or tentatively presumed by comparison with reference standards or literature data. According to the qualitative results, a new quantitative analysis method of ultra-performance liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (QqQ-MS) was established. 24 representative compounds were simultaneously detected in 10 batches of GLGZD samples in 7.5 min. The calibration curves for all analytes showed good linearity (r>0.9959) within the test ranges. The LODs and the LOQs were less than 30.6 and 70.9 ng/mL, respectively. The RSDs of intra- and inter-day precision, repeatability and stability were below 3.64%, 4.85%, 4.84% and 3.87%, respectively. The overall recoveries ranged from 94.94% to 103.66%, with the RSDs within 5.12%. This study established a high sensitive and efficient method for the integrating quality control, including identification and quantification of Chinese medicinal preparation.

26170818|t|Systematic review of long-term Xingnao Kaiqiao needling effcacy in ischemic stroke treatment.
26170818|a|OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the long-term effect and safety of Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method in ischemic stroke treatment. DATA RETRIEVAL: We retrieved relevant random and semi-random controlled trials that used the Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method to treat ischemic stroke compared with various control treatments such as conventional drugs or other acupuncture therapies. Searched databases included China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Weipu Information Resources System, Wanfang Medical Data System, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Cochrane Library, and PubMed, from May 2006 to July 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two authors independently conducted literature screening, quality evaluation, and data extraction. The quality of articles was evaluated according to the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook 5.1, and the study was carried out using Cochrane system assessment methods. RevMan 5.2 was used for meta-analysis of the included studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality rate, recurrence rate, and disability rate were observed. RESULTS: Nine randomized and semi-randomized controlled trials treating 931 cases of ischemic stroke were included in this review. Meta-analysis results showed that there were no significant differences in mortality reduction (risk ratio (RR) = 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-1.93, Z = 0.89, P = 0.37) or recurrence rate (RR = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.18-1.70, Z = 1.04, P = 0.30) of ischemic stroke patients between the Xingnao Kaiqiao needling and control treatment groups. However, the Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method had a tendency towards higher efficacy in mortality reduction and recurrence rates. The Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method was significantly better than that of the control treatment in reducing disability rate (RR = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.27-0.98, Z = 2.03, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method has a better effect than control treatment in reducing disability rate. The long-term effect of Xingnao Kaiqiao needling against ischemic stroke is better than that of control treatment. However, the limitations of this study limit the strength of the conclusions. Randomized controlled trials with a strict, reasonable design, and multi-center, large-scale samples and follow-up are necessary to draw conclusions about Xingnao Kaiqiao needling.

25510970|t|Momordica charantia polysaccharides could protect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through inhibiting oxidative stress mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 signaling pathway.
25510970|a|Momordica charantia (MC) is a medicinal plant for stroke treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine, but its active compounds and molecular targets are unknown yet. M. charantia polysaccharide (MCP) is one of the important bioactive components in MC. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that MCP has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through scavenging superoxide (O2(-)), nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) and inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK3) signaling cascades. We conducted experiments with in vivo global and focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rat models and in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) neural cells. The effects of MCP on apoptotic cell death and infarction volume, the bioactivities of scavenging O2(-), NO and ONOO(-), inhibiting lipid peroxidation and modulating JNK3 signaling pathway were investigated. Major results are summarized as below: (1) MCP dose-dependently attenuated apoptotic cell death in neural cells under OGD condition in vitro and reduced infarction volume in ischemic brains in vivo; (2) MCP had directing scavenging effects on NO, O2(-) and ONOO(-) and inhibited lipid peroxidation; (3) MCP inhibited the activations of JNK3/c-Jun/Fas-L and JNK3/cytochrome C/caspases-3 signaling cascades in ischemic brains in vivo. Taken together, we conclude that MCP could be a promising neuroprotective ingredient of M. charantia and its mechanisms could be at least in part attributed to its antioxidant activities and inhibiting JNK3 signaling cascades during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

26054191|t|[Effect of Electroacupuncture stimulation of acupoints of the Pericardium Meridian on serum NGF and Nogo-A contents and cerebral NGF and Nogo-A expression in cerebral ischemia rats].
26054191|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation of "Tianquan"(PC 2), "Quze" (PC 3), "Neiguan" (PC 6), "Daling" (PC 7) of the Pericardium Meridian on cerebral angiogenesis in cerebral ischemia (CI) rats, so as to reveal its mechanisms underlying improvement of stroke. METHODS: A total of 50 SD rats were equally randomized into normal control, sham, model, EA-Pericardium-Meridian acupoints (EA-PCM) and EA-Lung-Meridian acupoint (EA-LUM) groups. The CI model was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. EA (2-4 V, 20 Hz) was applied to PC 2, PC 3, PC 6, PC 7 and "Tianfu"(LU 3), "Chize" (LU 5), "Lieque" (LU 7), "Taiyuan" (LU 9) of the Lung Meridian for 30 min, once at time-points of 0 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively after modeling. Serum nerve growth factor (NGF) and Nogo protein-A (Nogo-A) contents were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cerebral NGF and Nogo-A immunoactivity levels in the ischemic cerebral tissue were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: (1) Compared to the normal control group, serum NGF and Nogo-A contents, and cerebral NGF immunoactivity level in the model group were significantly increased (P < 0.01). Following EA interventions, serum and cerebral NGF levels were further significantly up-regulated in the EA-PCM and EA-LUM groups (P < 0.01), while serum Nogo-A contents were down-regulated in the two EA groups (P < 0.01). The effect of EA-PCM was markedly superior to that of EA-LUM in up-regulating serum and cerebral NGF levels and down-regulating serum No- go-A level (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found between the normal control and sham groups in serum and cerebral NGF and Nogo-A levels (P > 0.05) , and among the 5 groups in cerebral Nogo-A levels (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: EA stimulation of acupoints of both Pericardium Meridian and Lung Meridian can up-regulate serum NGF, cerebral NGF expression and down-regulate serum Nogo-A in CI rats, and the effect of Pericardium Meridian is markedly superior to that of Lung Meridian, suggesting a possible better nerve repair effect of EA-PCM acupoints on ischemic brain.

25660232|t|miR-487b promotes human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation through regulating THBS1.
25660232|a|Angiogenesis is essential for recovery from various neurovascular diseases, such as ischemic stroke. Previous studies have revealed the regulatory role of MicroRNAs in angiogenesis in various types of cancer cells. However, the role of miR-487b in angiogenesis and how it regulates the angiogenic process of endothelial cells remain unclear. In this study, we found miR-487b was up-regulated in the plasma of ischemic stroke patients. Further, over-expression of miR-487b enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Using bioinformatic analysis, we found a putative binding site of miR-487b in the 3' untranslated regions of Thrombospondin 1 mRNA, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis. This direct binding was confirmed by luciferase assay. These results demonstrate that miR-487b regulates angiogenesis by directly targeting THBS1 in HUVECs, indicating that miR-487b may contribute to angiogenesis and the functional recovery from ischemic stroke. miR-487b could represent a potential therapeutic option for neurovascular disease.

25886469|t|Buyang huanwu decoction promotes angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 activation through the PI3K/Akt pathway in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage.
25886469|a|BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a fatal subtype of stroke that lacks effective treatments. Angiogenesis following ICH is an important response mediating brain recovery and repair. Phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (pVEGFR2) via PI3K/Akt signaling plays a key role in mediating cellular processes involved in repair, such as mitogenesis, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability. This study aimed to investigate the potential effects of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, on angiogenesis by VEGFR2 activation through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway in a mouse model of ICH. METHODS: Adult male Kunming mice (n = 50) were randomly assigned into sham and ICH-operated groups and treated with one of the followings SU5416 (VEGFR2 inhibitor), BYHWT and BYHWT + SU5416. ICH was induced in mice by injecting collagenase (type VII) into the right globus pallidus of the mouse brain. BYHWD (4.36 g/kg) was administrated in mice by intragastric infusion. Neurological function was evaluated in mice by a modified Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS) as well as corner turn and foot-fault tests. Angiogenesis was examined by intraperitoneal injection of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in mice to quantify new brain vessel growth. SU5416 treatment and assessment of VEGFR2 phosphorylation as well as alterations in PI3K/Akt signaling were performed to determine whether the effect of BYHWD on angiogenesis was partly mediated by phosphorylation of VEGFR2 via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. RESULTS: We show that BYHWD treated mice exhibited (i) significantly better recovery from neurological dysfunction, (ii) increased BrdU(+) nuclei in vWF(+) dilated brain vessels and (iii) higher VEGFR2 phosphorylation immunoreactivity in brain microvessels (P <0.05), (iv) higher expression of PI3K and pAkt at the protein level (P <0.05) when compared to untreated ICH mice. These beneficial effects were reversed by SU5416 (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: BYHWD promoted neurological recovery and angiogenesis after ICH in mice by enhancing VEGFR2 phosphorylation through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

25560670|t|The natural therapeutic magnesium lithospermate B potently provides neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.
25560670|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Salvia miltiorrhiza, a perennial plant in the genus Salvia and popularly known as "Danshen", is highly valued for its roots in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). It has widely used for the treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases in China. Recently, the cerebral protection of magnesium lithospermate B (MLB), a working extract from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has received more attention. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of MLB on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) injury using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to CI/R using a thread to occlude the right middle cerebral artery. After 2h of cerebral ischemia, the middle cerebral artery was reperfused for 24 h. Rats were injected with different doses of MLB (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg). Infarct zones, neurological deficit scores, brain water content, glutamate levels and protein expressions were evaluated after 24h of reperfusion. RESULTS: We found that MLB treatment of rats exposed to focal CI/R decreased neurological deficit scores, brain water content, glutamate levels and cerebral infarct zones. We also demonstrated that MLB can inhibit CI/R injury-induced activation of caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis. This protection by MLB against CI/R injury was accompanied by an upregulation of p-Akt in the ischemic hemisphere. Furthermore, the MLB-induced protection was prevented by treatment with a PI3K inhibitor (LY-294002). CONCLUSIONS: The data in the present study suggest a potential protective role of MLB against CI/R injury in rats. The salient finding of the present study is that this protective effect of MLB is likely mediated through an Akt-dependent pathway.

25575944|t|Tanshinone IIA attenuates the cerebral ischemic injury-induced increase in levels of GFAP and of caspases-3 and -8.
25575944|a|Tanshinone IIA (TSA) is a lipid soluble agent derived from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen). This plant is a traditional Chinese herb, which has been used widely in China especially for enhancing circulation. However mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain poorly understood. The present study was designed to illuminate events that may underlie the apparently neuroprotective effects of TSA following ischemic insult. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia by use of a middle cerebral artery occlusion model. They were then randomly divided into a sham-operated control group, and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion groups receiving a two-hour occlusion. Further subsets of groups received the same durations of occlusion or were sham-operated but then received daily i.p. injections of high or low doses of TSA, for seven or 15days. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed lesions in the entorhinal cortex of both rats subject to ischemia and to a lesser extent to those receiving TSA after surgery. Levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), caspase-3 and caspase-8, were quantified by both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. TSA treatment after middle cerebral artery occlusion, markedly reduced infarct size, and reduced the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8. These changes were considered protective and were generally proportional to the dose of TSA used. These results suggest that TSA may effect neuroprotection by way of reduction of the extent of cell inflammation and death within affected regions.

25727354|t|Mirror neuron therapy for hemispatial neglect patients.
25727354|a|Mirror neuron system(MNS) based therapy has been employed to treat stroke induced movement disorders. However, its potential effects on patients with hemispatial neglect were uninvestigated. The present study set out to test the therapeutic efficiency of video watching of series of hand actions/movements (protocol A) in two patients with left hemispatial neglect, due to the right hemisphere stroke. The video containing dynamic landscape of natural scene or cities but not human/animals was used as the protocol B. The "ABA" training procedure for 3 weeks therefore allows us to internally control the individual differences. Before and after each week of training, the Chinese behavioral inattention test- Hongkong version (CBIT-HK) was implemented to evaluate the hemispatial neglect severity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment was implemented in two health subjects to reveal the difference of brain activation between protocol A and B. The results showed that protocol A rather than protocol B significantly improved the CBIT-HK scores at first and third weeks, respectively. Protocol A induced more bilateral activations including right inferior parietal lobe (supramarginal gyrus), which belongs to MNS and is also critical region resulting to hemineglect.CONCLUSION: MNS activation can provide a novel therapy for hemispatial neglect patients.

24858257|t|A randomized clinical study on optimum proposal of integration of disease and syndrome to treat viral myocarditis.
24858257|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimum treatment for viral myocarditis (VMC). METHODS: A total of 126 VMC patients were randomly divided into the control group (42 cases) that was treated with conventional Western medicine, and the intervention group (84 cases) that was treated with a combination of Chinese medicine (CM) and Western medicine intervention termed optimum proposal of integration of disease and syndrome (OPIDS). Before and after 4 weeks of treatment, the integral of CM syndrome, self-rating depression and anxiety scales (SDS and SAS, respectively), echocardiograms (ECGs), heart rate variability and left ventricular systolic function were observed. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions on the SDS and SAS (P <0.05); improvement of premature ventricular beats, atrioventricular blocks, ST-segment abnormalities, and significant T wave changes (P <0.05); greater reductions in standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), standard deviation for per 5 min averages NN intervals (SDANN), and root-mean-square of successive difference of NN intervals (rMSSD) (P <0.05); and increases in cardiac output, stroke volume, and ejection fraction, the last of which was statistically significant (P <0.05). Overall, the treatment efficacy rate was significantly better P<0.05) in the intervention group (75.61%) compared with the control group (69.70%). CONCLUSION: OPIDS is quite effective in treating VMC and improves symptoms such as anxiety and depression, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, premature ventricular contraction, and cardiac autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

25491769|t|Implantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells for ischemic stroke: perspectives and challenges.
25491769|a|Ischemic stroke is a focal cerebral insult that often leads to many adverse neurological complications severely affecting the quality of life. The prevalence of stroke is increasing throughout the world, while the efficacy of current pharmacological therapies remains unclear. As a neuroregenerative therapy, the implantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) has shown great possibility to restore function after stroke. This review article provides an update role of hUC-MSCs implantation in the treatment of ischemic stroke. With the unique "immunosuppressive and immunoprivilege" property, hUC-MSCs are advised to be an important candidate for allogeneic cell treatment. Nevertheless, most of the treatments are still at primary stage and not clinically feasible at the current time. Several uncertain problems, such as culture conditions, allograft rejection, and potential tumorigenicity, are the choke points in this cellular therapy. More preclinical researches and clinical studies are needed before hUC-MSCs implantation can be used as a routinely applied clinical therapy.

25497901|t|Rapid analysis of hypolipidemic drugs in a live zebrafish assay.
25497901|a|INTRODUCTION: Hyperlipidemia is the most common form of dyslipidemia, which is the key risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke. The development of effective and safe drug treatments for hyperlipidemia has been proven challenging. METHODS: In this study, taking advantage of the transparency of larval zebrafish, we developed a zebrafish hyperlipidemia model for drug screening and efficacy assessment. Zebrafish at 5 d.p.f (days post fertilization) were fed with 0.1% egg yolk for 48 h (hours), followed by drug treatment for 24h or 48 h. Tested drugs were administered into the zebrafish by direct soaking. Drug effect was evaluated based on quantitative analysis of Oil Red O (ORO) in zebrafish vena caudalis. RESULTS: All 5 human hypolipidemic drugs (simvastatin, lovastatin, ezetimibe, bezafibrate and hyodesoxycholic acid) showed significant hypolipidemic effects (p<0.01) in a dose-dependent manner in the zebrafish hyperlipidemia model. 'We also found a well-known Chinese tea Pu-erh tea significantly reduced lipids in this model (p<0.001 and p<0.01). DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that the zebrafish hyperlipidemia model developed and validated in this study could be used for in vivo hyperlipidemia studies and drug screening and for assessing hypolipidemic drugs with different mechanisms.

25501307|t|Adiponectin gene polymorphisms contributes to ischemic stroke risk: A meta-analysis.
25501307|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported the relation between the adiponectin polymorphisms and the risk of ischemic stroke. However, the findings is inclusive. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the relation between the adiponectin polymorphisms and the stroke. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, Wanfang database in China, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases (CNKI) through July 2013 and other method such as reviewing the reference of retrieved literatures. We selected literatures that reported Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the relation between the ischemic stroke and the adiponectin genetic polymorphisms. With 1720 stroke cases and 5549 controls, were included. Our results showed that rs2241766 was associated with the risk of ischemic stroke in a recessive model (GG vs (TT+TG), OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.64, p = 0.04). However, rs1501299 and rs266729 were not found to be associated with ischemic stroke in our analysis. CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that rs2241766 polymorphism of adiponectin gene was associated with the risk for ischemic stroke.

26248428|t|[Effects of Jiji decoction on the cognitive function and oxidative stress in mice with vascular dementia induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion].
26248428|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of Jiji decoction (Traditional Chinese Medicine) on the cognitive function and oxidative stress in mice with vascular dementia (VD) induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. METHODS: Thirty-two mice were randomly divided into nonnal group (n = 8), sham group (operation, but no cerebral ischemia/reperfusi6n, n = 8), model group (vascular dementia model induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, n = 8), and Jiji decoction-treated group (vascular dementia model plus treatment with Jiji decoction, n = 8). Fourteen days of treatment after operation, the cognitive behavior was measured in step-through test, spatial probe test and platform test. Afterwards, to assess the levels of oxidative stress, the activity of superoxide dismutase(SOD) and content of malonaldehyde (MDA) in brain of these mice were measured. RESULTS: Data from step-through test indicated that the escaping latency of Jiji decoction-treated group was prolonged and the error counts were decreased significantly ( P <0.01) compared with those of model group. Data from spatial probe test indicated that the time of entering darkroom, the time of climbing height and the time of entering bright room in Jiji decoction-treated group were shortened and the counts of climbing height were increased (P < 0.05-0.01) significantly compared with those of model group. Data from platform test showed that the escaping latency of Jiji decoction-treated group was prolonged significantly (P < 0.01) compared with that of model group. Compared with normal and sham group, the activity of SOD was decreased and the content of MDA was increased in model group significantly (P < 0.01). Compared with those of model group, the levels of SOD and MDA in Jiji decoction-treated group were improved significantly (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Jiji decoction could improve cognitive function of VD mice. Its mechanism might be related with the inhibition of oxidative stiess in the brain.

26062195|t|[Acupuncture therapy for regaining consciousness in terms of acupoint location, needle insertion and needle manipulation].
26062195|a|Acupuncture therapy for regaining consciousness activates soreness, numbness, distention, heaviness, radiating and moving, electric shock and ant climbing sensations at the specific acupoints in the stroke patients. Radiating and moving sensations are the summary of needling sensations such as soreness, numbness and twitching presenting during lifting and thrusting manipulation. These sensations are the essential factors of the therapeutic effect of regaining consciousness. Radiating sensation refers to the conduction along meridians and radiation of soreness and numbness. Moving sensation refers to the local muscular twitching at acupoints and the involuntary movement of limbs, joints and the distal. Acupuncture at the specific acupoints achieves radiating and moving sensations for promoting the circulation in meridians, regulating qi and mind and balancing yin and yang in stroke patients. This therapy was introduced in the paper in view of acupoint location, needle insertion and manipulation.

25951630|t|[Treating ischemic stroke patients of deficiency of qi and yin syndrome and static blood obstructing collaterals syndrome by Yangyin Yiqi Huoxue Recipe: a clinical study of therapeutic effect].
25951630|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect of Yangyin Yiqi Huoxue Recipe (YYHR, the basic recipe of Yangyin Tongnao Granule) in treatment of ischemic stroke patients of deficiency of qi and yin syndrome (DQYS) and static blood obstructing collaterals syndrome (SBOCS). METHODS: Totally 312 patients were assigned to the control group (86 cases) and the treatment group (226 cases) using strati- fied randomized allocation method. Patients in the treatment group were treated with modified YYHR, while those in the control group took Xueshuan Xinmaining. The treatment course was 4 weeks for all. Constituent ratios of the acute stage and the recovery stage of DQYS and SBOCS and their complicated syndromes were observed in the two groups. Changes of the clinical curative effect, clinical symptoms integral, whole blood viscosity ratio, plasma viscosity ratio, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), total cho- lesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were detected in the two groups before and after treatment. RESULTS: There was statistical difference in constituent ratios of the acute stage and the recovery stage of DQYS SBOCS and its complicated syndromes between the two groups (P < 0.01). DQYS and SBOCS was basic syndrome types of the two groups. The cured and markedly effective rate was 71.24%(161/226) in the treatment group and 43.02% (37/86) in the control group. The total effective rate was 91.15% (206/226) in the treatment group, higher than that of the control group (76.74%, 66/86) with statistical difference (P < 0.01). There was statistical difference in the clinical symptoms integral, whole blood viscosity ratio, plasma viscosity ratio, hematocrit, ESR, TC, TG,HDL-C, and LDL-C (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of ischemic stroke patients could be improved by modified YYHR. Indices such as the whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity ratio, hematocrit, ESR, abnormal metabolism of blood lipids were also significantly improved. Pathological changes of blood stasis induced by qi-yin deficiency exist in ischemic stroke patients, and DQYS and SBOCS were basic syndrome types.

25888114|t|Evaluation of Tai Chi Yunshou exercises on community-based stroke patients with balance dysfunction: a study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial.
25888114|a|BACKGROUND: Balance dysfunction after stroke limits patients' general function and participation in daily life. Previous researches have suggested that Tai Chi exercise could offer a positive improvement in older individuals' balance function and reduce the risk of falls. But convincing evidence for the effectiveness of enhancing balance function after stroke with Tai Chi exercise is still inadequate. Considering the difficulties for stroke patients to complete the whole exercise, the current trial evaluates the benefit of Tai Chi Yunshou exercise for patients with balance dysfunction after stroke through a cluster randomization, parallel-controlled design. METHODS/DESIGN: A single-blind, cluster-randomized, parallel-controlled trial will be conducted. A total of 10 community health centers (5 per arm) will be selected and randomly allocated into Tai Chi Yunshou exercise group or balance rehabilitation training group. Each community health centers will be asked to enroll 25 eligible patients into the trial. 60 minutes per each session, 1 session per day, 5 times per week and the total training round is 12 weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline and 4-weeks, 8-weeks, 12-weeks, 6-week follow-up, 12-week follow-up after randomization. Safety and economic evaluation will also be assessed. DISCUSSION: This protocol aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi Yunshou exercise for the balance function of patients after stroke. If the outcome is positive, this project will provide an appropriate and economic balance rehabilitation technology for community-based stroke patients.

25556683|t|Acupuncture improves locomotor function by enhancing GABA receptor expression in transient focal cerebral ischemia rats.
25556683|a|Stroke is the major cause of long-term disability among adults. Recent studies have found that GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission plays a vital role in ameliorate locomotor damage after ischemic injury. Acupuncture has been widely used to improve locomotor function. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study is designed to investigate whether GABA and GABA receptors are involved in the mechanism underlying acupuncture treatment in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). One week after acupuncture at JiaJi acupoint, the locomotor function and infarct volumes were tested. Then level of GABA and the expressions of GABAAγ2 and GABABR2 were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Compared with normal group, GABAAγ2 and GABABR2 expressions were decreased in striatum and spinal cord of the MCAO group. After acupuncture, the expressions of the two receptors were increased, but levels of GABA and trafficking protein, kinesin binding 1 (TRAK1), which plays a role in the intracellular transport of GABA receptors, were unchanged. The present study suggests that acupuncture could reverse locomotor function by modulating the expressions of GABA receptors in MCAO rats.

25680184|t|The effect of Tai Chi training on cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
25680184|a|BACKGROUND: Tai Chi may be efficient for healthy adults to improve the cardiorespiratory fitness, but there is no systematic evaluation for its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the effectiveness of Tai Chi on cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy adults. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched from their inception to October 2013. The controlled trails including randomized controlled trial (RCT), non-randomized controlled trial (NRCT), self-controlled trial (SCT), and cohort study (CS) testing Tai Chi exercise against non-intervention control conditions in healthy adults that assessed any type cardiorespiratory fitness outcome measures were considered. Two reviewers independently performed the selection of the studies according to predefined criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane criteria. RevMan 5.2 software was applied for data analysis. RESULTS: Twenty studies (2 RCTs, 8 NRCTs, 3 SCTs, and 7 CSs) with 1868 participants were included, but most of them belonged to low methodological quality. The results of systematic review showed that Tai Chi exercise had positive effect on majority outcomes of cardio function (Blood pressure: n = 536, SPB SMD = -0.93, 95% CI -1.30 to -0.56, P < 0.00001; DBP SMD = -0.54, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.18, P < 0.00001; heart rate at quiet condition: n = 986, SMD = -0.72, 95% CI -1.27 to -0.18, P = 0.010; stroke volume: n = 583, SMD = 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.61, P < 0.00001; cardio output: n = 583, MD = 0.32 L/min, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.56, P = 0.009), lung capacity (FVC at quiet condition: n = 1272, MD = 359.16 mL, 95% CI 19.57 to 698.75, P = 0.04 for less than one year intervention, and MD = 442.46 mL, 95% CI 271.24 to 613.68, P<0.0001 for more than one year intervention; V·O2peak: n = 246, SMD = 1.33, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.70, P < 0.00001), and cardiorespiratory endurance (O2 pulse at quiet condition: n = 146, SMD = 1.04; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.39; P < 0.00001; stair test index at quiet condition: n = 679, SMD = 1.34, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.40, p = 0.01). No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The results are encouraging and suggest that Tai Chi may be effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy adults. However, concerning the low methodological quality in the included studies, more larger-scale well-designed trails are needed till the specific and accurate conclusions can be perorated.

25653103|t|Xuebijing injection reduces organ injuries and improves survival by attenuating inflammatory responses and endothelial injury in heatstroke mice.
25653103|a|BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of heatstroke is a multi-factorial process involved with an interplay among subsequent inflammation, endothelial injury and coagulation disturbances, which makes pharmacological therapy of heatstroke a challenging problem. Xuebijing injection (XBJ), a traditional Chinese medicine used to sepsis, has been reported to suppress inflammatory responses and restore coagulation disturbances. However, little is known about the role of XBJ in heatstroke. METHODS: Mice were treated with indicated dose of XBJ before and/or after the induction of heatstroke. Serum inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and endothelial markers, von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and E-selectin, were measured by ELISA. Liver, kidney and heart profiles including alanine aminotransferase, aspartic aminotransferase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate dehydrogenase, were evaluated by UniCel DxC 800 Synchron Clinical Systems, and troponin was measured by ELISA. Coagulation profiles, including thrombin time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, and fibrinogen were examined by STA Compact® Hemostasis System. Jejunum injury was evaluated with H&E staining. Changes in mitochondrial structure in cardiac tissue were assesed by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Pretreatment with XBJ decreased serum pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-6, as well as endothelial injury markers, vWF and E-selectin, in a dose-dependent manner in heatstroke mice. Similar protective effects were observed when XBJ was administered after, or both before and after heat insult. These protective effects lasted for over 12 h in mice receiving XBJ before and after heat insult. XBJ also improved survival rates in heatstroke mice, ameliorated liver, heart, and kidney injuries, including mitochondrial damage to the heart, and reduced coagulation disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: XBJ prevents organ injuries and improves survival in heatstroke mice by attenuating inflammatory responses and endothelial injury. XBJ may be a potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of heatstroke.

25012632|t|Chinese medicines and bioactive compounds for treatment of stroke.
25012632|a|Stroke is an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide but effective therapeutic strategy for the prevention of brain injury in patients with cerebral ischemia is lacking. Although tissue plasminogen activator has been used to treat stroke patients, this therapeutic strategy is confronted with ill side effects and is limited to patients within 3 h of a stroke. Due to the complexity of the events and the disappointing results from single agent trials, the combination of thrombolytic therapy and effective neural protection therapy may be an alternative strategy for patients with cerebral ischemia. Chinese medicine (CM) is the most widely practiced form of herbalism worldwide, as it is a sophisticated system of medical theory and practice that is specifically different from Western medicine. Most traditional therapeutic formulations consist of a combination of several drugs. The combination of multiple drugs is thought to maximize therapeutic efficacy by facilitating synergistic actions and preventing possible adverse effects while at the same time marking at multiple targets. CM has been labeled in ancient medicine systems as a treatment for various diseases associated with stroke. This review summarizes various CMs, bioactive compounds and their effects on cerebral ischemia.

25637152|t|A survey on the prevalence and utilization characteristics of gua sha in the Hong Kong community.
25637152|a|OBJECTIVE: To conduct a community-based survey to describe the demographics, experience, and utilization variables among the users of gua sha living in Hong Kong. METHOD: A total of 3209 adult respondents were surveyed by using a short Chinese questionnaire. RESULTS: Gua sha was found to have a one-year prevalence of 22.7% and four-week prevalence of 6.6%. The users were seen to be old of age and less educated. The majority believed that gua sha is beneficial to health, practiced in non-regular basis, and mainly employed for treating illnesses. For both male and female, the top two common illnesses to be treated were the respiratory and pain problems, which accounting for 74% of all users. Other illnesses included nervousness, heat stroke, fever, infection, dizziness, diarrhoea and vomiting, oedema, and constipation. As practiced by most respondents, unidirectional pressured stroking was applied repeatedly on the lubricated skin surface at the back region using various smooth-edged tools typically spoons. Almost all users reported the occurrence of skin blemishing and subsequently faded within 7 days after the gua sha treatment. CONCLUSION: The general population of Hong Kong was found to have high prevalence of gua sha usage. The utilization characteristics as reported by the users were generally aligned with the current scientific knowledge, in particular the treatment procedures and response.

26032524|t|Usage of Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T & CM): Prevalence, Practice and Perception among Post Stroke Patients Attending Conventional Stroke Rehabilitation in A Teaching Hospital in Malaysia.
26032524|a|INTRODUCTION: The lack of evidence that proves the benefit of traditional and complementary medicines (T & CM) in treating chronic medical conditions does not deter its usage among patients worldwide. Prevalence of usage among post-stroke patients in Malaysia especially is unknown. This study aims to determine the prevalence, practice and perception of T & CM use among stroke survivors attending an outpatient rehabilitation program in a teaching hospital. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 104 post stroke patients attending an outpatient rehabilitation program. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic and clinical profile of patients, as well as types of therapy used and perception on T & CM usage. Descriptive analysis was done, and bivariate analysis was used to determine associations between categorical data. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 62 years (SD 12.2), 54% were Chinese and 75% of the patients had ischaemic stroke. Mean age of T & CM users was younger compared to non- T & CM users (61 years vs. 66 years, p=0.04). Two-thirds (66%) of patients admitted to concurrent T & CM usage while attending conventional post stroke rehabilitation. Acupuncture (40.4%), massage (40.4%) and traditional Chinese medicine (11.5%) were the most common T & CM used. Positive perception was recorded in terms of ability of T & CM usage to relieve post stroke symptoms (68%), and it was safe to use because it was made from 'natural sources'. Negative perception recorded: T & CM caused significant adverse effects (57.6%) and was not safe to be used in combination with other conventional medicines (62.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent T & CM usage among post-stroke patients attending structured outpatient rehabilitation program is widely practised especially acupuncture, massage and traditional Chinese medicines. Overall the perception towards its use is favourable.

25883629|t|Point application with Angong Niuhuang sticker protects hippocampal and cortical neurons in rats with cerebral ischemia.
25883629|a|Angong Niuhuang pill, a Chinese materia medica preparation, can improve neurological functions after acute ischemic stroke. Because of its inconvenient application and toxic components (Cinnabaris and Realgar), we used transdermal enhancers to deliver Angong Niuhuang pill by modern technology, which expanded the safe dose range and clinical indications. In this study, Angong Niuhuang stickers administered at different point application doses (1.35, 2.7, and 5.4 g/kg) were administered to the Dazhui (DU14), Qihai (RN6) and Mingmen (DU4) of rats with chronic cerebral ischemia, for 4 weeks. The Morris water maze was used to determine the learning and memory ability of rats. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining were used to observe neuronal damage of the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region in rats with chronic cerebral ischemia. The middle- and high-dose point application of Angong Niuhuang stickers attenuated neuronal damage in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region, and improved the memory of rats with chronic cerebral ischemia with an efficacy similar to interventions by electroacupuncture at Dazhui (DU14), Qihai (RN6) and Mingmen (DU4). Our experimental findings indicate that point application with Angong Niuhuang stickers can improve cognitive function after chronic cerebral ischemia in rats and is neuroprotective with an equivalent efficacy to acupuncture.

25481359|t|Hippocampal cAMP/PKA/CREB is required for neuroprotective effect of acupuncture.
25481359|a|Acupuncture has beneficial effects in vascular dementia (VaD) patients. The underlying mechanism, however, remains unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether the cAMP/PKA/CREB cascade is involved in the mechanism of acupuncture in cerebral multi-infarction rats. In this study, cerebral multi-infarction was modeled in adult Wistar rats by homologous blood clot emboli. After a two-week acupuncture treatment at Zusanli (ST36), hippocampal-dependent memory was tested by employing a radial arm maze test. The hippocampus was isolated for analyses of cAMP concentration, phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity and CREB/pCREB and ERK/pERK expressions. The Morris water maze (MWM) task and CREB phosphorylation were evaluated in the presence of PKA-selective peptide inhibitor (H89). The radial arm maze test results demonstrated that acupuncture treatment at ST36 reversed hippocampal-dependent memory in impaired animals. Compared to those of the impaired group, cAMP concentration, PKA activity and pCREB and pERK expressions were increased following acupuncture therapy. Finally, the blockade of PKA reversed the increase in CREB phosphorylation and the improvement in recognitive function induced by acupuncture treatment. These results suggest that acupuncture could improve hippocampus function by modulating the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway, which represents a molecular mechanism of acupuncture for recognitive function in cerebral multi-infarction rats.

25408503|t|Neuroprotection by saponins.
25408503|a|Saponins, an important group of bioactive plant natural products, are glycosides of triterpenoid or steroidal aglycones. Their diverse biological activities are ascribed to their different structures. Saponins have long been recognized as key ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine. Accumulated evidence suggests that saponins have significant neuroprotective effects on attenuation of central nervous system disorders, such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the observed effects remains incomplete. Based on recently reported data from basic and clinical studies, this review highlights the proposed mechanisms of their neuroprotective function including antioxidant, modulation of neurotransmitters, anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, attenuating Ca(2+) influx, modulating neurotrophic factors, inhibiting tau phosphorylation, and regeneration of neural networks.

25881461|t|[Effect of blood activating stasis removing method on prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhage patients].
25881461|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect and safety of blood activating stasis removing method (BASRM) on intracerebral hemorrhage patients. METHODS: A multi-center, prospective, randomized, open, controlled and blinded endpoint design was adopted. Totally 228 intracerebral hemorrhage patients were assigned to the treatment group and the control group, 114 in each group by center randomized method. All patients received basic treatment of Western internal medicine. Patients in the treatment group received intravenous infusion with Xingnaojing Injection (XI) from the 1st day of grouping, 20 mL per day for 14 days. Then they took or were nasally fed with Chinese medical granules (by syndrome typing as complicated with wind syndrome, fire syndrome, and phlegm syndrome) for 21 days. Finally they took Naoxueshu Oral Liquid (NOL), 10 mL each time, 3 times per day till the 3rd month of incidence. Patients' disability degree, activities of daily living, neurological impairment, the effective rate, physiologic functions, mental status, social relationship, and degree of treatment satisfaction were assessed using Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Barthel index (BI), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and patient reported outcome (PRO). Head CT was performed to evaluate the absorption of hematoma at the 1st and 7th day of grouping. The safety was also assessed. RESULTS: Totally 108 patients in the treatment group and 112 patients in the control group completed the trial. There was no statistical difference in the total effective rate between the two groups after 3 months of treatment (P>0.05). The MRS score was obviously lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P<0.01) at month 3 after attack (P<0.01). There was statistical difference in the difference between pre-post hematoma volume between the two groups after 7-day treatment (P<0.05). The NIHSS score of two groups at the 7th, 14th, 21st day, and 3rd month decreased significantly (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the decremenit of NIHSS score decreased more obviously in the treatment group at day 7, 21, and 3rd month (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the BI increased (P<0.01); physiologic fupctions, social relationship, treatment satisfaction and total score in PRO scale were all lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P<0.05, P<0.01). The incidence of adverse events occurred in 7 cases (6.14%) in the treatment group and 5 cases (4.39%) in the control group, with no statistical difference (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: BASRM could lower the deformity rate of intracerebral hemorrhage patients at month 3, effectively promote hematoma absorption within 7 days, improve neurologic impairment, and elevate living abilities at month 3 of onset.

25600516|t|A systematic review and meta-analysis of Ginsenoside-Rg1 (G-Rg1) in experimental ischemic stroke.
25600516|a|The neuroprotective actions of Ginsenoside-Rg1 (G-Rg1) have been documented for experimental stroke therapy. We used a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of G-Rg1 in experimental ischemic stroke. We identified studies describing the efficacy of G-Rg1 in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia. Primary outcomes were infarct volume and neurological function score (NFS). In all, eleven studies reported significant effects of G-Rg1 for improving the NFS when compared with the control group (P < 0.00001), and four studies reported significant effects of G-Rg1 for reducing infarct volume compared with middle cerebral artery occlusion group (P < 0.00001). Meanwhile, studies reported G-Rg1 was more efficacious than positive control drug nimodipine (0.7 or 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) according to NFS (P = 0.009) and infarct volume (p = 0.0002). The results demonstrate a marked efficacy of G-Rg1 in experimental acute ischemic stroke, but raise concerns that our value of effect size might be overestimate due to factors such as study quality and possible publication bias. Even so, the findings suggest G-Rg1 as a candidate neuroprotective drug for human ischemic stroke.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism and effect of SLI on stroke outcome in type 1 diabetic (T1DM) rats. T1DM were induced in adult male Wistar rats by injecting streptozotocin. T1DM rats were then subjected to 90 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). SLI (10.5, 21, 42 mg/kg, respectively) was administered by tail vein injection at 24 hours after MCAO, and dayly and last for 14 days. The neurological deficit score and brain infarct volume were assessed after 14 days. Also, VEGF, BDNF, TrkB, CREB and p-CREB levels in the ischemic brain tissue were analyzed with western blot at 14 days after MCAO. SLI significantly reduced neurological deficit scores and cerebral infarct volume, and reduced lesion volumes at all time points. SLI also increased the expression of VEGF, BDNF, TrkB, CREB and p-CREB protein levels in T1DM-MCAO rats. In summary, our results demonstrate that SLI can improve functional recovery after stroke in diabetic rats, and the mechanism of treating cerebral ischemic injury is related to the activation of the VEGF, BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling pathway.

25498890|t|Neuroprotective effect of ginsenoside-Rg1 on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats by downregulating protease-activated receptor-1 expression.
25498890|a|AIMS: Ginsenoside-Rg1 (G-Rg1), a saponin that is a primary component of ginseng, is very useful and important in traditional Chinese medicine for stroke. The objective of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of G-Rg1 on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. MAIN METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurological examinations were performed by using Longa's 5-point scale. The brain infarct volume was determined by the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was evaluated by Evans blue dye. Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR were used to assess protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) expression. KEY FINDINGS: After G-Rg1 treatment, there was a significant decrease in the neurobehavioral function score compared with normal saline (NS) treatment after ischemia/reperfusion (P<0.05). G-Rg1 significantly reduced the infarct volume compared with NS treatment after ischemia/reperfusion (P<0.001). The permeability of the BBB was significantly decreased in the G-Rg1 group compared with the NS group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Western blot and quantitative real time RT-PCR indicated that G-Rg1 administration down-regulated the expression of PAR-1 in the ischemic hemisphere compared with NS administration (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). The level of PAR-1 expression strongly correlated with BBB permeability in both the G-Rg1- and NS-treated rats (r=0.856 and r=0.908, respectively, P<0.01). SIGNIFICANCE: G-Rg1 may ameliorate the neurological injury, the brain infarct volume and the BBB permeability induced by focal cerebral ischemia in rats and its neuroprotective mechanism is related to the down-regulation of PAR-1 expression.

25620952|t|Efficacy and Safety of Panax notoginseng Saponin Therapy for Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage, Meta-Analysis, and Mini Review of Potential Mechanisms of Action.
25620952|a|Intracranial/intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a leading cause of death and disability in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke. No proven drug is available for ICH. Panax notoginseng (total saponin extraction, PNS) is one of the most valuable herb medicines for stroke and cerebralvascular disorders in China. We searched for randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) involving PNS injection to treat cerebral hemorrhage for meta-analysis from various databases including the Chinese Stroke Trials Register, the trials register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Chinese BioMedical disk, and China Doctorate/Master Dissertations Databases. The quality of the eligible trials was assessed by Jadad's scale. Twenty (20) of the 24 identified randomized controlled trials matched the inclusive criteria including 984 ICH patients with PNS injection and 907 ICH patients with current treatment (CT). Compared to the CT groups, PNS-treated patients showed better outcomes in the effectiveness rate (ER), neurological deficit score, intracranial hematoma volume, intracerebral edema volume, Barthel index, the number of patients died, and incidence of adverse events.CONCLUSION: PNS injection is superior to CT for acute ICH. A review of the literature shows that PNS may exert multiple protective mechanisms against ICH-induced brain damage including hemostasis, anti-coagulation, anti-thromboembolism, cerebral vasodilation, invigorated blood dynamics, anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and anti-hyperglycemic effects. Since vitamin C and other brain cell activators (BCA) that are not considered common practice were also used as parts of the CT in several trials, potential PNS and BCA interactions could exist that may have made the effect of PNS therapy less or more impressive than by PNS therapy alone. Future PNS trials with and without the inclusion of such controversial BCAs as part of the CT could clarify the situation. As PNS has a long clinical track record in Asia, it could potentially become a therapy option to treat ICH in the US and Europe. Further clinical trials with better experimental design could determine the long-term effects of PNS treatment for TBI and stroke.

26579420|t|Ameliorating effects of traditional Chinese medicine preparation, Chinese materia medica and active compounds on ischemia/reperfusion-induced cerebral microcirculatory disturbances and neuron damage.
26579420|a|Ischemic stroke and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by thrombolytic therapy are conditions with high mortality and serious long-term physical and cognitive disabilities. They have a major impact on global public health. These disorders are associated with multiple insults to the cerebral microcirculation, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, leukocyte adhesion and infiltration, brain blood barrier (BBB) disruption, and capillary hypoperfusion, ultimately resulting in tissue edema, hemorrhage, brain injury and delayed neuron damage. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in China, Korea, Japan and other Asian countries for treatment of a wide range of diseases. In China, the usage of compound TCM preparation to treat cerebrovascular diseases dates back to the Han Dynasty. Even thousands of years earlier, the medical formulary recorded many classical prescriptions for treating cerebral I/R-related diseases. This review summarizes current information and underlying mechanisms regarding the ameliorating effects of compound TCM preparation, Chinese materia medica, and active components on I/R-induced cerebral microcirculatory disturbances, brain injury and neuron damage.

26621442|t|Electroacupuncture for Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
26621442|a|Electroacupuncture (EA) is an extension technique of acupuncture based on traditional acupuncture combined with modern electrotherapy. Here, we conducted a systematic review specifically to assess the effectiveness and safety of EA for acute ischemic stroke. Eight databases were searched for randomized-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of EA for acute ischemic stroke published from inception to June 2013. Ultimately, 67 studies claimed to be RCTs. Eighteen studies with 1411 individuals were selected for the analyses, which got ≥ 4 "yes" in the domains of Cochrane risk of bias tool. The meta-analysis showed a significant effect of EA for improving Barthel Index (p < 0.00001), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (p < 0.00001), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (p < 0.00001), and Revised Scandinavian Stroke Scale (p < 0.00001) compared with western conventional treatments (WCTs). In an analysis of the total clinical efficacy rate, there was a significant difference between EA and WCTs (p=0.0002). Adverse effects were monitored in 6 studies, and were well tolerated in all stroke patients. According to the GRADE approach, the quality of evidence was mostly high or moderate. In conclusion, this systematic review revealed the evidence in support of the use of EA for acute ischemic stroke, although further larger sample-size and rigorously designed RCTs are required.

26477801|t|Chinese Herbal Products for Ischemic Stroke.
26477801|a|Traditional Chinese herbal products (CHPs) have been described in ancient medicine systems as treatments for various stroke-associated ailments. This study is aimed to investigate the prescription patterns and combinations of CHPs for ischemic stroke in Taiwan. Prescriptions of CHPs for ischemic stroke were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. Every prescription with a leading diagnosis of ischemic stroke made during 2000-2010 was analyzed. Descriptive statistics were applied to the pattern of co-prescriptions. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess demographic and risk factors that are correlated with CHP use. The dataset of inpatient claims data contained information on 15,896 subjects who experienced ischemic stroke from 2000 to 2010. There was an average of 5.82 CHPs in a single prescription for subjects with ischemic stroke. Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang (BYHWT) (40.32%) was by far the most frequently prescribed formula CHP for ischemic stroke, and the most commonly used combination of two-formula-CHP was BYHWT with Shu-jin-huo-xue-tang (SJHXT) (4.40%). Dan Shen (16.50%) was the most commonly used single CHP for ischemic stroke, and the most commonly used combination of two single CHPs was Shi Chang Pua with Yuan Zhi (4.79%). We found that BYHWT and Dan Shen were the most frequently prescribed formula and single CHP for ischemic stroke, respectively. These results provide information about individualized therapy and may contribute to further pharmacologic experiments and clinical trials.

25967667|t|Paeoniflorin, a Monoterpene Glycoside, Protects the Brain from Cerebral Ischemic Injury via Inhibition of Apoptosis.
25967667|a|Paeoniflorin (PF) is a principal bioactive component, which exhibits many pharmacological effects, including protection against ischemic injury. This paper aimed to investigate the protective effect of PF both in vivo and in vitro. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed on male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat for 2 h, and different doses of PF or vehicle were administered 2 h after reperfusion. Rats were sacrificed after 7 days treatment of PF/vehicle. PF treatment for 7 days ameliorated MCAO-induced neurological deficit and decreased the infarct area. Further study demonstrated that PF inhibited the over-activation of astrocytes and apoptosis of neurons, and PF promoted up-regulation of neuronal specific marker neuron-specific nuclear (NeuN) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) in brain. Moreover, NMDA-induced neuron apoptosis was employed. The in vitro study revealed that PF treatment protected against NMDA-induced cell apoptosis and neuronal loss via up-regulation of neuronal specific marker NeuN, MAP-2 and Bcl-2 and the down-regulation Bax. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that PF produces its protective effect by inhibiting the over-activation of astrocytes, apoptosis of neurons and up-regulation of neuronal specific marker NeuN, MAP-2, and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and down-regulation Bax. Our study reveals that PF may be a potential neuroprotective agent for stroke and can provide basic data for clinical use.

26180810|t|Circulating MicroRNAs: Potential and Emerging Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases.
26180810|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are composed of a group of endogenous and noncoding small RNAs which control expression of complementary target mRNAs. The extended functions of miRNAs enhance the complexity of gene-regulatory processes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Indeed, recent studies have shown that miRNAs are closely related to myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, angiogenesis, coronary artery disease, dyslipidaemia, stroke, and so forth. These findings suggest a new therapeutic pointcut for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and show the extensive therapeutic potential of miRNA regulation. Moreover, it has been shown that circulating extracellular miRNAs are stable in bodily fluids, which indicates circulating miRNAs as potential and emerging biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis. This review highlights the most recent findings indicative of circulating miRNAs as potential clinical biomarkers for diagnosis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

25714979|t|The effect of acori graminei rhizoma and extract fractions on spatial memory and hippocampal neurogenesis in amyloid beta 1-42 injected mice.
25714979|a|Acori graminei Rhizoma (AGR), the dry rhizoma of Acorus gramineus Soland (Araceae), has been used as an Asian traditional herbal medicine against senile dementia, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have revealed neuroprotective effects of AGR on neuronal damage and learning impairment, while mostly focused on the effect of volatile oil fraction of AGR. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of different extract fractions from AGR against Alzheimer disease-like symptoms induced by Amyloid Beta (Aß) 1-42 intra-hippocampal injection. On day 7 after intra-hippocampal injection of saline or Aβ1-42, spatial memory was assessed by the first Morris water maze, followed by 3-week intra-gastric administration of saline or water extract, volatile oil fraction, or defatted decoction fraction of AGR respectively. Mice were subsequently subjected to the second Morris water maze task. Levels of Aβ1-42 and expressions of doublecortin and nestin in the hippocampus were examined using immunohistochemistry. Our results suggested that treatment with these different extract fractions from AGR could ameliorate cognitive impairment and down-regulate expressions of doublecortin and nestin in the hippocampus of Aβ1-42 injected mice, in which water extract and volatile oil fractions were more effective in spatial memory than defatted decoction fraction.

25557373|t|Factor VIII levels are associated with ischemic stroke, stroke subtypes and neurological worsening.
25557373|a|The role played by hemostasis in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is still controversial. In the present study, we looked for a possible association of ischemic stroke with the high clotting activity of factor VIII (FVIII). The study population consisted of 116 patients with acute ischemic stroke who had been admitted between September 2013 and September 2014 to the Department of Neurology, Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and 76 control subjects with no history of stroke. FVIII levels were higher in stroke patients as compared to controls (127.5 ± 52.5 vs. 108.4 ± 49.0 IU/dL; P = 0.012). In a univariate risk analysis, FVIII at levels above 150 IU/dL was associated with an odds ratio (OR) for ischemic stroke of up to 2.55 (95% CI, 1.20-5.42, P = 0.013). In a multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model including age, hypertension, low density lipoprotein cholesterol level, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and high FVIII (< 150 IU/dL), high FVIII was still found to significantly add to the risk of ischemic stroke (OR = 3.26 with 95% CI, 1.38-7.68, P = 0.007). As for the stroke subtypes, mean FVIII level was significantly higher in patients with cardioembolic stroke than patients with noncardioembolic stroke (156.0 ± 51.5 IU/dL vs. 124.3 ± 51.9 IU/dL). High levels of FVIII were also associated significantly with neurological worsening (OR = 3.66 with 95% CI, 1.24-10.82, P = 0.019). A high plasma level of FVIII is a prevalent and independent risk factor for ischemic stroke and neurological worsening after acute stroke.

25360841|t|Effects and Perspectives of Chinese Patent Medicines for Tonifying Qi and Promoting Blood Circulation on Patients with Cerebral Infarction.
25360841|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stroke is a disease with high morbidity, disability, and fatality. Since ischemic stroke is the most common kind of stroke, increasing attention has been paid to its prevention and treatment. Given the limitations of conventional medicine, there is growing interest in Chinese Medicine (CM), especially Chinese Patent Medicine (CPM) for its convenience and stability. Studies of CM show that Chinese Patent Medicines for Tonifying Qi and Promoting Blood Circulation (CPMs-TQPBC) are one of the most common and effective categories of all clinical CPMs in China. METHODS: This review investigated and summarized the randomized controlled trials (RCT) of CPMs-TQPBC combined with conventional interventions in the last 10 years. RESULTS: Trial results demonstrated the potential in reducing the endpoints and improving neurologic impairments, body movements, Barthel index, quality of life, and certain biomarkers. Furthermore, certain CM syndromes were alleviated with rare adverse events. Advantages of interventions combined with CPMs-TQPBC for patients with cerebral infarction were discovered. Compared with the Chinese patent medicines for promoting blood circulation (CPMs-PBC) alone, CPMs for both tonifying qi and promoting blood circulation exhibited noticeably better effects. The underlying reasons could be related to the improvement of microcirculation in the brain, protection against ischemic reperfusion injury, generation of neuroprotective factors, and inhibition of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Under the circumstances of qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome (QDBSS) (Qixu-Xueyu Zheng), CPMs- TQPBC showed a substantial difference. More trials focusing on specific patient groups should be carried out to corroborate and expand the findings.

26451066|t|Tissue Kallikrein Activity, Detected by a Novel Method, May Be a Predictor of Recurrent Stroke: A Case-Control Study.
26451066|a|AIM: Tissue kallikrein (TK) protein content in plasma has been shown to be negatively associated with both incident and recurrent strokes. The aims of this study were to develop a novel method for detecting TK activity and to investigate its association with event-free survival over 5 years in Chinese first-ever stroke patients. METHODS: We designed a case-control study with 321 stroke patients (174: ischemic stroke, 147: hemorrhagic stroke) and 323 healthy local controls. TK activity was measured by a novel assay utilizing the immunological characteristics of TK and the catalysis of benzoyl arginine ethyl ester hydrochloride (BAEE). RESULTS: TK protein levels above 0.200 mg/L in plasma were not associated with urinary TK activity or the risk of stroke recurrence. TK activity was significantly lower in stroke patients compared with controls (1.583 ± 0.673 Eu/mL versus 1.934 ± 0.284 Eu/mL, P < 0.001). After adjusting for traditional risk factors, TK activity was negatively associated, in a dose-response manner, with the risk of overall stroke recurrence and positively associated with event-free survival during a 5-year follow-up (relative risk (RR), 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.84; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that urinary TK activity may be a stronger predictor of stroke recurrence than plasma TK levels.

26576189|t|The Effect of Acupuncture on the Motor Function and White Matter Microstructure in Ischemic Stroke Patients.
26576189|a|Evidence shows that ischemic stroke can induce brain structural reorganization. Acupuncture is advised as an adjunct to mainstream rehabilitation after stroke. However, the effectiveness of acupuncture is inconsistent among previous studies. Fourteen ischemic patients were collected and divided into two groups: conventional treatment group (CG) and acupuncture treatment group (AG). The results of a Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and diffusion tensor imaging were collected before and after treatment. The AG exhibited a higher improvement in FMA than the CG. Repeated measures analysis of variance on diffusion data only found a significant main effect for scanning time point in all diffusion indices. In each group, a postpair t-test revealed that diffusion indices values were changed significantly after treatment intervention in the body of the corpus callosum and bilateral corticospinal tracts, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the forceps minor, the cingulum gyrus, and the thalamic radiation. However, there was no significant difference in the diffusion indices between the two groups. In conclusion, acupuncture had a better behavioral score than traditional medicine treatment. However, acupuncture did not significantly change WM in the AG compared to the CG as expected within one month after the intervention.

26557863|t|Nao-Xue-Shu Oral Liquid Improves Aphasia of Mixed Stroke.
26557863|a|Objective. The objective is to observe whether the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Nao-Xue-Shu oral liquid improves aphasia of mixed stroke. Methods. A total of 102 patients with aphasia of mixed stroke were divided into two groups by a single blind random method. The patients treated by standard Western medicine plus Nao-Xue-Shu oral liquid (n = 58) were assigned to the treatment group while the remaining patients treated only by standard Western medicine (n = 58) constituted the control group. Changes in the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and hemorheology parameters were assessed to evaluate the effects of the treatments. Results. Excluding the patients who dropped out, 54 patients in the treatment group and 51 patients in the control group were used to evaluate the effects. Significant and persistent improvements in the WAB score, specifically comprehension, repetition, naming, and calculating, were found in the treatment group when the effects were evaluated at the end of week 2 and week 4, respectively, compared with baseline. The naming and writing scores were also improved at the end of week 4 in this group. The comprehension and reading scores were improved at the end of week 4 in the control group compared with the baseline, but the improvements were smaller than those in the treatment group. The percentages of patients at the 0-1 range of mRS were increased at the end of week 2 and week 4 in both groups, but the improvements in the treatment group were much larger than those in the control group. Greater improvements in the NIHSS scores and the hemorheology parameters in the treatment group were also observed compared with the control group at the end of week 2 and week 4. Conclusion. Nao-Xue-Shu oral liquid formulation improved aphasia in mixed stroke patients and thus might be a potentially effective drug for treating stroke aphasia.

26539220|t|The Clinical Relevance of Serum NDKA, NMDA, PARK7, and UFDP Levels with Phlegm-Heat Syndrome and Treatment Efficacy Evaluation of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Acute Ischemic Stroke.
26539220|a|According to the methods of Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) based on the patient reports internationally and referring to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guide, some scholars developed this PRO of stroke which is consistent with China's national conditions, and using it the feel of stroke patients was introduced into the clinical efficacy evaluation system of stoke. "Ischemic Stroke TCM Syndrome Factor Diagnostic Scale (ISTSFDS)" and "Ischemic Stroke TCM Syndrome Factor Evaluation Scale (ISTSFES)" were by "Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Program) (number 2003CB517102)." ISTSFDS can help to classify and diagnose the CM syndrome reasonably and objectively with application of syndrome factors. Six syndrome factors, internal-wind syndrome, internal-fire syndrome, phlegm-dampness syndrome, blood-stasis syndrome, qi-deficiency syndrome, and yin-deficiency syndrome, were included in ISTSFDS and ISTSFES. TCM syndrome factor was considered to be present if the score was greater than or equal to 10 according to ISTSFDS. In our study, patients with phlegm-heat syndrome were recruited, who met the diagnosis of both "phlegm-dampness" and "internal-fire" according to ISTSFDS. ISTSFES was used to assess the syndrome severity; in our study it was used to assess the severity of phlegm-heat syndrome (phlegm-heat syndrome scores = phlegm-dampness syndrome scores + internal-fire syndrome scores).

26508980|t|Traditional Chinese Medicine Decreases the Stroke Risk of Systemic Corticosteroid Treatment in Dermatitis: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.
26508980|a|Epidemiological studies have shown a strong association between dermatitis and stroke. Systemic corticosteroid, the mainstay treatment for dermatitis, could enhance the atherosclerotic process. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used for dermatitis to decrease the side effects of corticosteroid. However, the different stroke risk in dermatitis patients treated with systemic corticosteroid or TCM remains unclear. This study identified 235,220 dermatitis patients and same comorbidity matched subjects between 2000 and 2009 from database of NHRI in Taiwan. The two cohorts were followed until December 31, 2011. The primary outcome of interest was new diagnosis of stroke. The crude hazard ratio (HR) for future stroke among dermatitis patients treated with systemic corticosteroid was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.34-1.45; P < 0.0001) and TCM was 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.13; P < 0.0001). The log-rank test showed a higher cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke in the patient treated with only systemic corticosteroid group than that treated with systemic corticosteroid and TCM, only TCM, and neither systemic corticosteroid nor TCM in the matched cohort during the follow-up period (P < 0.0001). We demonstrated that patients treated with systemic corticosteroid had an increased risk of stroke and that the risk probably decreased by TCM treatment.

26483845|t|Qualitative Evaluation of Baduanjin (Traditional Chinese Qigong) on Health Promotion among an Elderly Community Population at Risk for Ischemic Stroke.
26483845|a|Background. Baduanjin is a traditional Chinese qigong that has been practiced for a long time in China as a mind-body exercise in community elderly populations. The objective of this study was to qualitatively evaluate the perceived benefit of regular Baduanjin qigong in community elders. Methods. A total of 20 participants who had completed the 12-week Baduanjin qigong training were interviewed regarding their perceived effect on physical and psychological health and whether Baduanjin qigong was suitable for the elderly. Results. Almost all participants agreed that Baduanjin qigong could promote their multisystem or organ functions (e.g., digestive and circulatory systems), increase their immunity, make their bodies relax, and improve their mood and confidence. Most of the participants also agreed that Baduanjin qigong was appropriate for elderly individuals. Few individuals felt bored because of an hour Baduanjin training each day. Conclusions. The findings suggest that regular Baduanjin qigong may be potentially helpful to promote the overall physical and psychological health of elderly community populations and may be useful and feasible as a body-mind exercise in the health promotion in the elderly community populations.

26161127|t|Eye Acupuncture Treatment for Stroke: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
26161127|a|There were applications of eye acupuncture for stroke patients. Unfortunately, similar to many other Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments, it lacks comprehensive evaluation and system review for its effect and safety. Objective. This study is a systematic review to appraise the safety and effectiveness of eye acupuncture for stroke. Methods. "Eye acupuncture therapy" in eleven databases was searched by randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials. The search activity was ended in April 2014. The data were extracted and assessed by three independent authors. Rev Man 5.0 software was used for data analysis with effect estimate presented as relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. Results. Sixteen trials (1120 patients) were involved with generally poor methodological quality. The study indicated that when eye acupuncture was combined with western medicine compared to western medicine, there was a significant difference in the areas of mental state, swallow function, and NDS. When eye acupuncture was combined with western medicine and rehabilitation compared to western medicine and rehabilitation, there was significant difference in the changes of SSS, FMA, and constipation symptoms evaluation. No adverse events or side effects have been reported. Conclusions. The current evidence is insufficient and the rigorously designed trials are warranted.

26089946|t|Chinese Herbal Compounds for the Prevention and Treatment of Atherosclerosis: Experimental Evidence and Mechanisms.
26089946|a|Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Research into the disease has led to many compelling hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic lesion formation and the resulting complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Herbal medicine has been widely used in China as well as other Asian countries for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases for hundreds of years; however, the mechanisms of action of Chinese herbal medicine in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis have not been well studied. In this review, we briefly describe the mechanisms of atherogenesis and then summarize the research that has been performed in recent years regarding the effectiveness and mechanisms of antiatherogenic Chinese herbal compounds in an attempt to build a bridge between traditional Chinese medicine and cellular and molecular cardiovascular medicine.

25861363|t|A microarray study of middle cerebral occlusion rat brain with acupuncture intervention.
25861363|a|Microarray analysis was used to investigate the changes of gene expression of ischemic stroke and acupuncture intervention in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) rat brain. Results showed that acupuncture intervention had a remarkable improvement in neural deficit score, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral infarction volume of MCAo rats. Microarray analysis showed that a total of 627 different expression genes were regulated in ischemic stroke. 417 genes were upregulated and 210 genes were downregulated. A total of 361 different expression genes were regulated after acupuncture intervention. Three genes were upregulated and 358 genes were downregulated. The expression of novel genes after acupuncture intervention, including Tph1 and Olr883, was further analyzed by Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Upregulation of Tph1 and downregulation of Olr883 indicated that the therapeutic effect of acupuncture for ischemic stroke may be closely related to the suppression of poststroke depression and regulation of olfactory transduction. In conclusion, the present study may enrich our understanding of the multiple pathological process of ischemic brain injury and indicate possible mechanisms of acupuncture on ischemic stroke.

25784950|t|Tai chi chuan for the primary prevention of stroke in middle-aged and elderly adults: a systematic review.
25784950|a|Background. Stroke is a major healthcare problem with serious long-term disability and is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Prevention of stroke is considered an important strategy. Methods. Seven electronic databases were searched. Results. 36 eligible studies with a total of 2393 participants were identified. Primary outcome measures, TCC exercise combined with other intervention had a significant effect on decreasing the incidence of nonfatal stroke (n = 185, RR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.85, P = 0.03) and CCD (n = 125, RR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.96, P = 0.04). For the risk factors of stroke, pooled analysis demonstrated that TCC exercise was associated with lower body weight, BMI, FBG level, and decreasing SBP, DBP, plasma TC, and LDL-C level regardless of the intervention period less than half a year or more than one year and significantly raised HDL-C level in comparison to nonintervention. Compared with other treatments, TCC intervention on the basis of the same other treatments in patients with chronic disease also showed the beneficial effect on lowering blood pressure. Conclusion. The present systematic review indicates that TCC exercise is beneficially associated with the primary prevention of stroke in middle-aged and elderly adults by inversing the high risk factors of stroke.

25452777|t|Evidence of timing effects on acupuncture: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
25452777|a|According to Traditional Chinese Medicine there is an optimum time to administer acupuncture at a particular acupoint. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the timing effects of acupuncture at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoint. A total of 10 healthy volunteers and 10 post-stroke patients were recruited. The subjects received acupuncture stimulation at ST36 during two time periods: between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. (the AM condition) and between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. (the PM condition), seven days later. Blood oxygenation level-dependent signals were captured while the patient was receiving the acupuncture stimulation. The results showed a stronger activation in the AM condition than in the PM condition in both healthy and stroke subjects. The significant regions in the healthy subjects included the prefrontal cortex, cingulum, thalamus and cerebellum; for the stroke patients, the significant regions were the cuneus, supplementary motor area and inferior parietal gyrus. Timing can therefore modulate brain activation patterns during acupuncture in healthy subjects and stroke patients; however, the modulation effect appears to differ between the two subject groups. Further studies are required to explore the timing effects of acupuncture at different acupoints in different populations.

26565980|t|A Quantitative Investigation of Pulse and Tongue Features in Post-Stroke Depressive Patients and Healthy Volunteers: An Observational Pilot Study.
26565980|a|BACKGROUND: Depression is among the most common neuropsychiatric complications after stroke, having a negative impact on one's quality of life. A number of therapeutic modalities have been used for post-stroke depression (PSD) including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, a lack of objectivity in TCM hampers further improvement in diagnosis and research, since TCM diagnosis is mainly based on subjective judgment of clinicians. In this study, a modern TCM diagnostic device was used to conduct an objective study of pulse and tongue features in PSD patients and healthy individuals. METHODS: A total of 67 volunteers participated. Pulse and tongue information of each participant was acquired and analyzed by the TCM Four Diagnosis Auxiliary Apparatus. Quantitative data were gathered and compared between the PSD group and the healthy group. RESULTS: Higher rates of weak, slow, slippery, and string pulse were observed in the PSD group (p < 0.01), whereas normal pulse (p < 0.01) was detected in the healthy group. In the tongue analysis, higher rates of purple tongue (p < 0.01) with yellow fur (p < 0.01) and pale-pink tongue (p = 0.023) with white fur (p < 0.01) were observed in the PSD and the healthy groups, respectively. Abnormal tongue features (old, soft, thin, enlarged, thorny, and cracked) were detected (p < 0.05) in the PSD group. CONCLUSIONS: Objective and quantitative data of PSD patients and healthy individuals may help providing valuable clinical information for PSD research and establish quantitative TCM diagnostic standards for pulse and tongue diagnosis in clinical practice and research.

25553478|t|Inflammation in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.
25553478|a|Ischemic stroke is a common cause of permanent disability in adults worldwide. Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and its mechanism is complex. Both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, an imbalance of which leads to inflammation. Inflammatory cells from both the innate and acquired immune systems are involved in ischemic stroke-related inflammation; processes that are linked by the action of interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Although most inflammatory cells promote inflammation, T regulatory cells (Tregs) may have a protective function at the early stages of an ischemic injury, but a negative role during later stages. However, the precise mechanism of inflammation in ischemic stroke remains elusive; further understanding of it may provide new ideas for the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke. In this review, we discuss the role of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators and related immune cells in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.

26756191|t|Protective Effect of Ethanol Extracts of the Chinese Caterpillar Mushroom, Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Ascomycetes), on the Experimental Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion/Reperfusion (MCAO/R) Model.
26756191|a|In this study, we investigated the effects of ethanol extracts of Ophiocordyceps sinensis (EEOS) on neuroprotective efficacy in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (IR). The effects of EEOS on mortality rate, neurobehavior, grip strength, polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, interleukin (IL)-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry. The cerebral infarction was examined through tetrazolium chloride staining. EEOS significantly inhibited IR-induced brain production of IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS, ICAM-1, and COX-2. Moreover, EEOS suppressed infiltration of PMN cells. EEOS caused a significant reduction in the infarct size compared with the middle cerebral artery occlusion group. The study demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of EEOS inhibition of IR through anti-inflammatory activity in a rat model of IR.

25685150|t|Edible mushrooms: improving human health and promoting quality life.
25685150|a|Mushrooms have been consumed since earliest history; ancient Greeks believed that mushrooms provided strength for warriors in battle, and the Romans perceived them as the "Food of the Gods." For centuries, the Chinese culture has treasured mushrooms as a health food, an "elixir of life." They have been part of the human culture for thousands of years and have considerable interest in the most important civilizations in history because of their sensory characteristics; they have been recognized for their attractive culinary attributes. Nowadays, mushrooms are popular valuable foods because they are low in calories, carbohydrates, fat, and sodium: also, they are cholesterol-free. Besides, mushrooms provide important nutrients, including selenium, potassium, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin D, proteins, and fiber. All together with a long history as food source, mushrooms are important for their healing capacities and properties in traditional medicine. It has reported beneficial effects for health and treatment of some diseases. Many nutraceutical properties are described in mushrooms, such as prevention or treatment of Parkinson, Alzheimer, hypertension, and high risk of stroke. They are also utilized to reduce the likelihood of cancer invasion and metastasis due to antitumoral attributes. Mushrooms act as antibacterial, immune system enhancer and cholesterol lowering agents; additionally, they are important sources of bioactive compounds. As a result of these properties, some mushroom extracts are used to promote human health and are found as dietary supplements.

25295621|t|Comparison of vascular cognitive impairment--no dementia by multiple classification methods.
25295621|a|AIMS: To compare vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCI-ND) using different classification methods. METHODS: We recruited 56 patients with VCI-ND between April 2012 and March 2013. We used a battery of neuropsychological tests to classify patients with VCI-ND into different subtypes based on memory and executive function as follows: cognitive screening (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE), memory (Auditory Verbal Learning Test, AVLT), executive/attention (Shape Trails Test, STT; Stroop Color-Word Test, SCWT; Reading the Mind in the Eyes, RME; Digit Ordering Test-A, DOT-A; Symbol Digit Modalities Test, SDMT), language (Action Naming Test, ANT; Boston Naming Test, BNT; Famous Face Test, FFT; Similarity Test, ST; Verbal Fluency Test, VFT) and visuospatial function (Complex Figure Test, CFT). RESULTS: The two groups had comparable demographic information (P>0.05). Amnestic VCI-ND (aVCI-ND) patients obtained significantly lower scores compared with individuals with nonamnestic VCI-ND (naVCI-ND) on the AVLT memory test, VFT language test and VFT-alternating executive test (P<0.05). Additionally, executive VCI-ND (eVCI-ND) patients performed significantly longer than nonexecutive VCI-ND (neVCI-ND) patients on the SCWT-C timed executive test. Finally, eVCI-ND patients obtained significantly lower scores compared with neVCI-ND patients on the RME, DOT-A and SDMT-correct executive tests and the ANT, BNT and ST language tests (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: aVCI-ND patients performed poorly compared with naVCI-ND patients in terms of executive and language functions, while eVCI-ND patients performed poorly compared with neVCI-ND patients in terms of language function.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the summer of 2010. It included 119 of 132 TCM hospitals in Hubei Province, China. TCM physicians were asked to recommend specific TCM treatments for common chronic conditions. Nine types of chronic conditions recommended more than 3.7 times (mean of frequencies of chronic conditions) are included in this analysis. Frequency of each TCM treatment and the number of visits by type of chronic conditions were calculated. RESULTS: The total number of recommendations by TCM physicians was 411. For seven types of treatments, six were recommended for musculoskeletal pain, five for soft tissue injuries, four for visceral pain and fractures, three for stroke and asthma, two for hemorrhoids, and one for hypertension. The most frequently recommended treatments for specific conditions include orally ingested herbs for visceral pain (n=3), type 2 diabetes (n=5), and hypertension (n=7); herbs for external use for soft tissue injuries (n=10), asthma (n=6), and hemorrhoids (n=8); acupuncture for musculoskeletal pains (n=43) and for stroke (n=10); and Chinese external fixation for fractures (n=24). The number of visits for recommended treatments per year of was 671,759. The most frequently recommended treatments for specific chronic conditions have most visits, except for chronic conditions such as musculoskeletal pains, visceral pains, soft tissue injuries, and asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with musculoskeletal pain have more treatment options than other patients. Herbal medicine is the option most commonly used for chronic conditions. These treatments for these conditions should be targeted for further evaluation of effectiveness and, only if found effective, considered for use in primary care settings.

25609367|t|SimTCM: A human patient simulator with application to diagnostic accuracy studies of Chinese medicine.
25609367|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to develop and implement the SimTCM, an advanced computational model that incorporates relevant aspects from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory as well as advanced statistical and epidemiological techniques for simulation and analysis of human patients. METHODS: SimTCM presents five major attributes for simulation: representation of true and false profiles for any single pattern; variable count of manifestations for each manifestation profile; empirical distributions of patterns and manifestations in a disease-specific population; incorporation of uncertainty in clinical data; and the combination of the four examinations. The proposed model is strengthened by following international standards for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies, and incorporates these standards in its treatment of study population, sample size calculation, data collection of manifestation profiles, exclusion criteria and missing data handling, reference standards, randomization and blinding, and test reproducibility. RESULTS: Simulations using data from patients diagnosed with hypertension and post-stroke sensory-motor impairments yielded no significant differences between expected and simulated frequencies of patterns (P=0.22 or higher). Time for convergence of simulations varied from 9.90 s (9.80, 10.27) to 28.31 s (26.33, 29.52). The ratio iteration profile necessary for convergence varied between 1:1 and 5:1. CONCLUSION: This model is directly connected to forthcoming models in a large project to design and implement the SuiteTCM: ProntTCM, SciTCM, DiagTCM, StudentTCM, ResearchTCM, HerbsTCM, AcuTCM, and DataTCM. It is expected that the continuity of the SuiteTCM project enhances the evidence-based practice of Chinese medicine. The software is freely available for download at: http://suitetcm.unisuam.edu.br.

25149059|t|Chinese herbal medicine formula tao hong si wu decoction protects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via PI3K/Akt and the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
25149059|a|The Chinese herbal medicine formula Tao Hong Si Wu decoction (THSWD) is traditionally used for the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke. Transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates a battery of phase II enzymes and is known as the major mechanism of cellular defense against oxidative stress. The present study aimed to explore the potential effect of THSWD on the Nrf2 signaling pathway and the consequent effect during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. We found that THSWD reduced infarct volume and improved neurological function in a rat stroke model induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Additionally, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), a key endogenous antioxidant enzyme regulated by Nrf2, was significantly further induced by THSWD in this in vivo model. In neuronal-like PC12 cells, THSWD remarkably up-regulated HO-1 expression and promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt kinase was found to be involved in the upstream of Nrf2 regulation. In an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD-Rep) model, THSWD treatment significantly reduced cell death induced by OGD-Rep insult. Importantly, the protective action was attenuated while PI3K activity was inhibited by a specific inhibitor, LY294002, and the Nrf2 signaling pathway was blocked by antioxidant response element (ARE) decoy oligonucleotides. Collectively, these results demonstrated that THSWD exhibited notable neuroprotective properties in vitro and in vivo and activation of PI3K/Akt and the Nrf2 signaling pathway may be, at least in part, responsible for the protection. This study provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the traditional use of the Chinese herbal medicine formula THSWD.

25788938|t|Therapeutic effects of different durations of acupuncture on rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion.
25788938|a|Acupuncture is regarded as an effective therapy for cerebral ischemia. Different acupuncture manipulations and durations may result in different therapeutic effects. In the present study, the Neiguan (PC6) acupoint of rats with occluded middle cerebral arteries was needled at a fixed frequency (3 Hz) with different durations, i.e., 5, 60 and 180 seconds under a twisting-rotating acupuncture method. Results showed that different durations of acupuncture had different therapeutic effects, with 60 seconds yielding a better therapeutic effect than the other two groups. This duration of treatment demonstrated rapid cerebral blood flow, encouraging recovery of neurological function, and small cerebral infarct volume. Experimental findings indicated that under 3 Hz frequency, the treatment of needling Neiguan for 60 seconds is effective for ischemic stroke.

26557222|t|Protective Effect of Edaravone in Primary Cerebellar Granule Neurons against Iodoacetic Acid-Induced Cell Injury.
26557222|a|Edaravone (EDA) is clinically used for treatment of acute ischemic stroke in Japan and China due to its potent free radical-scavenging effect. However, it has yet to be determined whether EDA can attenuate iodoacetic acid- (IAA-) induced neuronal death in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the effect of EDA on damage of IAA-induced primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and its possible underlying mechanisms. We found that EDA attenuated IAA-induced cell injury in CGNs. Moreover, EDA significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxidative stress production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase 3 activity induced by IAA. Taken together, EDA protected CGNs against IAA-induced neuronal damage, which may be attributed to its antiapoptotic and antioxidative activities.

26199678|t|Hsp20 Protects against Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reperfusion-Induced Golgi Fragmentation and Apoptosis through Fas/FasL Pathway.
26199678|a|Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury plays an important role in the development of tissue injury after acute ischemic stroke. Finding effective neuroprotective agents has become a priority in the treatment of ischemic stroke. The Golgi apparatus (GA) is a pivotal organelle and its protection is an attractive target in the treatment of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Protective effects of Hsp20, a potential cytoprotective agent due to its chaperone-like activity and involvement in regulation of many vital processes, on GA were assessed in an ischemia-reperfusion injury model. Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGDR) insult. OGDR induces Golgi fragmentation, apoptosis, and p115 cleavage in N2a cells. However, transfection with Hsp20 significantly attenuates OGDR-induced Golgi fragmentation and apoptosis. Hsp20 interacts with Bax, decreases FasL and Bax expression, and inhibits caspases 3 and p115 cleavage in N2a cells exposed to OGDR. Our data demonstrate that increased Hsp20 expression protects against OGDR-induced Golgi fragmentation and apoptosis, likely through interaction with Bax and subsequent amelioration of the OGDR-induced elevation in p115 cleavage via the Fas/FasL signaling pathway. This neuroprotective potential of Hsp20 against OGDR insult and the underlying mechanism will pave the way for its potential clinical application for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion related disorders.

25547030|t|Effect of CETP polymorphism on atorvastatin lipid-regulating effect and clinical prognosis of patients with coronary heart disease.
25547030|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of genetic polymorphism of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene polymorphism -629C/A on the therapeutic effect of atorvastatin and clinical outcome in Han Chinese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: From October 2011 to December 2012, 348 patients with angiographically confirmed CHD were recruited. CETP gene polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum level of CETP was determined with enzyme-1inked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lipid 1evel in all patients was determined at baseline and after 12 months of treatment with 20 mg/d of atorvastatin. All the patients were followed-up at least 12 months. Major adverse cardiac events, including death, non-fatal infarction, revascularization, and stroke (MACE), were recorded. RESULTS: The frequency of the -629A allele was 0.412. Compared with CC or CA genotypes, individuals with AA genotype had lower CETP levels (P=0.026) and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (P=0.035). After 12 months of atorvastatin therapy, carriers with CC genotype had greater reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P<0.001), reduced LP (a) (P=0.005), and elevated HDL-C (P=0.045) compared with CA or AA genotypes. The incidence of MACE after a mean follow-up of 17.3±5.2 months was 8.8%. The cumulative MACE-free survival rates were 90.1%, 85.2%, and 71.1% for CC, CA, and AA genotypes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the AA variant of the -629A allele of CETP gene had higher HDL-C levels and reduced CETP levels, but patients with CC genotype appeared to have benefited more from statin therapy with reduction in LDL-C and LP (a) levels. Long-term clinical prognosis was, however, not affected by the 3 genotypes.

25531102|t|The predictive value of the Boston Acute Stroke Imaging Scale (BASIS) in acute ischemic stroke patients among Chinese population.
25531102|a|OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the predictive value of Boston Acute Stroke Imaging Scale (BASIS) in acute ischemic stroke in Chinese population. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. 566 patients of acute ischemic stroke were classified as having a major stroke or minor stroke based on BASIS. We compared short-term outcome (death, occurrence of complications, admission to intensive care unit [ICU] or neurological intensive care unit [NICU]), long-term outcome (death, recurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, modified Rankin scale) and economic index including in-hospital cost and length of hospitalization. Continuous variables were compared by using the Student t test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical variables were tested with the Chi square test. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify whether BASIS was the independent predictive variable of death. RESULTS: During hospitalization, 9 patients (4.6%) died in major stroke group while no patients died in minor stroke group (p < 0.001), 12 patients in the major stroke group and 5 patients in minor stroke group were admitted to ICU/NICU (p = 0.001). There were more complications (cerebral hernia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection) in major stroke group than minor stroke group (p<0.05). Meanwhile, the average cost of hospitalization in major stroke group was 3,100 US$ and 1,740 US$ in minor stroke group (p<0.001); the average length of stay in major and minor stroke group was 21.3 days and 17.3 days respectively (p<0.001). Results of the follow-up showed that 52 patients (26.7%) died in major stroke group while 56 patients (15.1%) died in minor stroke group (P<0.001). 62.2% of the patients in major stroke group and 80.4% of the patients in minor stroke group were able to live independently (P = 0.002). The survival analysis showed that patients with major stroke had 80% higher of risk of death than patients with minor stroke even after adjusting traditional atherosclerotic factors and NIHSS at baseline (HR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-3.1). CONCLUSION: BASIS can predict in-hospital mortality, occurrence of complication, length of stay and hospitalization cost of the acute ischemic stroke patients and can also estimate the long term outcome (death and the dependency). BASIS could and should be used as a dichotomous stroke classification system in the daily practice.

25449515|t|Anti-platelet or anti-coagulant agent for the prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation--a nation-wide database analyses.
25449515|a|OBJECTIVE: The risk/benefit profiles of anti-coagulant or anti-platelet agents in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) remained unclear. We aimed to investigate the stroke risks in these patients with or without anti-coagulant/anti-platelet therapy by using our national database. METHOD: By using our national health insurance ESRD claim database, we searched patients with AF, more than 18 years old and without prior history of ischemic stroke. Medication information as well as the events of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and transient ischemic accident during follow-up were identified from the database. Propensity score method was used to match all the potential confounders between patients with and without anti-platelets/warfarin treatment. RESULT: A total of 134,410 ESRD patients were identified in the database. Among them, patients with non-valvular AF, over 18 years old, without prior history of ischemic stroke and received monotherapy with anti-platelets (1622) or warfarin (294) served as case groups while patients (2983) without taking any anti-platelets and warfarin served as control groups. The incidences of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were not different among the control (6.6%), anti-platelet (6.2%) and warfarin (5.1%) groups in a follow-up period of approximately 4 years. The results remained unchanged after propensity match. Cox-regression analyses also showed no beneficial effect of anti-platelet or warfarin therapy in overall and any subgroups. CONCLUSION: In this nationwide cohort analyses, we found that anti-platelet or warfarin treatment could not lower the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with ESRD.

25506838|t|Neuroprotective mechanism of BNG-1 against focal cerebral ischemia: a neuroimaging and neurotrophin study.
25506838|a|BNG-1 is a herb complex used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stroke. In this study, we attempted to identify the neuroprotective mechanism of BNG-1 by using neuroimaging and neurotrophin analyses of a stroke animal model. Rats were treated with either saline or BNG-1 for 7 d after 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion by filament model. The temporal change of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of brain was studied using a 7 Tesla MR imaging (MRI) system and the temporal expressions of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) in brain were analyzed before operation and at 4 h, 2 d, and 7 d after operation. Compared with the saline group, the BNG-1 group exhibited a smaller infarction volume in the cerebral cortex in T2 image from as early as 4 h to 7 d, less edema in the cortex in diffusion weighted image from 2 to 7 d, earlier reduction of postischemic hyperperfusion in both the cortex and striatum in perfusion image at 4 h, and earlier normalization of the ischemic pattern in the striatum in susceptibility weighted image at 2 d. NT-3 and BDNF levels were higher in the BNG-1 group than the saline group at 7 d. We concluded that the protective effect of BNG-1 against cerebral ischemic injury might act through improving cerebral hemodynamics and recovering neurotrophin generation.

25475247|t|Integrative medicine for subacute stroke rehabilitation: a study protocol for a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial.
25475247|a|INTRODUCTION: Many patients with stroke receive integrative medicine in China, which includes the basic treatment of Western medicine and routine rehabilitation, in conjunction with acupuncture and Chinese medicine. The question of whether integrative medicine is efficacious for stroke rehabilitation is still controversial and very little research currently exists on the integrated approach for this condition. Consequently, we will conduct a multicentre, randomised, controlled, assessor-blinded clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of integrative medicine on stroke rehabilitation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 360 participants recruited from three large Chinese medical hospitals in Zhejiang Province will be randomly divided into the integrative medicine rehabilitation (IMR) group and the conventional rehabilitation (CR) group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the IMR group will receive acupuncture and Chinese herbs in addition to basic Western medicine and rehabilitation treatment. The CR group will not receive acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. The assessment data will be collected at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks postrandomisation, and then at 12 weeks' follow-up. The primary outcome is measured by the Modified Barthel Index. The secondary outcomes are the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the mini-mental state examination and Montreal Cognitive, Hamilton's Depression Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the incidence of adverse events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from ethics committees of three hospitals. The results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international congresses. The results will also be disseminated to patients by telephone, during follow-up calls inquiring on patient's post-study health status.

25456424|t|Neuroprotective effects of Gualou Guizhi decoction in vivo and in vitro.
25456424|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine has been reported to have protective effects on ischemic stroke. The present study is to investigate the therapeutic effect of GLGZD on ischemic stroke and explore its mode of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GLGZD was studied on transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion in vivo, as well as on hippocampal primary neuron cultures in vitro. RESULTS: In vivo, it was shown that GLGZD treatment for 7 days could ameliorate transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced neurological deficit, histopathology changes and decrease infarct area. Further study demonstrated that GLGZD inhibited over-activation of astrocytes and apoptosis of neurons and GLGZD promoted up-regulation of neuronal specific marker neuron-specific nuclear (NeuN) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) in brain. Moreover, the in vitro study revealed that GLGZD treatment protected against NMDA-induced cell apoptosis and neuronal loss, and promoted up-regulation of neuronal specific marker NeuN. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the present study demonstrates that GLGZD produces a protection in the MCAO model rats via inhibiting over-activation of astrocytes, apoptosis of neurons and up-regulation of neuronal specific marker NeuN and MAP-2. Our study reveals that GLGZD might be a potential neuroprotective agent for stroke and can provide basic data for clinical use.

25453529|t|Rhubarb root and rhizome-based Chinese herbal prescriptions for acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
25453529|a|BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese Medicine has been using in stroke victims for thousands of years, and the rhubarb root and rhizome (RRR)-based Chinese herbal prescription is one of the principle treatments for stroke. The objective of this study is to systematically assess the clinical efficacy and safety of RRR-based prescriptions for acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: A systematic literature search in six databases was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which compared RRR-based prescriptions with western conventional medicine (WCM) for acute ischemic stroke. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed independently based on the 12 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. RESULTS: A total of 968 participants were included in 12 eligible studies. All trials were deemed to have high a risk of bias. RRR-based prescriptions have a significant effect on the improvement of the clinical efficacy rate (n=10), Barthel Index scores (n=5), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (n=2), Glasgow Coma Scale scores (n=1), and neurological deficit scores (n=5) when compared with WCM controls (p<0.05 or p<0.01). Six trials reported that there were no adverse events, while no mention of adverse effect monitoring was reported in the other 6 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the apparently positive findings, it is premature to recommend the routine use of RRR-based prescriptions for acute ischemic stroke because methodological flaws undermine the strength of our findings. However, this work identifies an area, which is worthy of improvement and development for further research. Larger sample-sizes and rigorously designed RCTs are required in the future.

25270312|t|Xuebijing attenuates hypotension through the upregulation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor-associated protein 1 in rats suffering from heat stroke.
25270312|a|In our previous study, we demonstrated that Xuebijing (XBJ), a traditional Chinese medicine, attenuates hypotension in rats suffering from heatstroke (HS). However, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Thus, the current study was carried out to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of XBJ on hypotension n rats suffering from HS. For this purpose, 72 anesthetized rats were randomized into 3 groups and intravenously injected twice daily for 3 days with XBJ (4 ml/kg body weight, XBJ group) or phosphate‑buffered saline (PBS) (HS and sham-operated groups). Models of HS were established in the HS and XBJ groups by placing the rats in a simulated climate chamber with a temperature of 40˚C and a humidity of 60%. Rectal temperature, arterial pressure and heart rate were monitored and recorded. Angiotensin Ⅱ (Ang Ⅱ) levels were increased during HS (shown by ELISA), and XBJ had no apparent effect on Ang Ⅱ levels. The levels of Ang Ⅱ type 1 (AT1) receptor surface expression and AT1 receptor-associated protein 1 (Arap1) were decreased during HS; however, these effects were attenuated by pre-treatment with XBJ (shown by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis). For in vitro experiments, rat macrophages pre-treated with XBJ were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Pre-treatment with XBJ induced a marked inhibitory effect on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the LPS-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, XBJ inhibited the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) induced by LPS in the macrophages. Taken together, our data demonstrate that XBJ promotes Arap1 expression by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may be the molecular mechanisms through which XBJ alleviates blood pressure reduction in rats suffering from HS.

25409029|t|Ultrasound-enhanced protective effect of tetramethylpyrazine against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
25409029|a|In traditional Chinese medicine, Ligusticum wallichii (Chuan Xiong) and its bioactive ingredient, tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), have been used to treat cardiovascular diseases and to relieve various neurological symptoms, such as those associated with ischemic injury. In the present study, we investigated whether ultrasound (US) exposure could enhance the protective effect of TMP against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Glutamate-induced toxicity to pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells was used to model I/R injury. TMP was paired with US to examine whether this combination could alleviate glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. The administration of TMP effectively protected cells against glutamate-induced apoptosis, which could be further enhanced by US-mediated sonoporation. The anti-apoptotic effect of TMP was associated with the inhibition of oxidative stress and a change in the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, Bcl-2 and Bax. Furthermore, TMP reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-8, which likely also contributes to its cytoprotective effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that ultrasound-enhanced TMP treatment might be a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke. Further study is required to optimize ultrasound treatment parameters.

25400113|t|Decompressive craniectomy for the treatment of malignant infarction of the middle cerebral artery.
25400113|a|Early decompressive craniectomy (DC) has been shown to reduce mortality in malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction, whereas efficacy of DC on functional outcome is inconclusive. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to estimate the effects of DC on malignant MCA infarction and investigated whether age of patients and timing of surgery influenced the efficacy. We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science update to June 2014. Finally, A total of 14 studies involved 747 patients were included, of which 8 were RCTs (341 patients). The results demonstrated that early DC (within 48 h after stroke onset) decreased mortality (OR = 0.14, 95%CI = 0.08, 0.25, p<0.0001) and number of patients with poor functional outcome (modified Rankin scale (mRS)>3) (OR = 0.38, 95%CI = 0.20, 0.73, p = 0.004) for 12 months follow-up. In the subgroup analysis stratified by age, early DC improved outcome both in younger and older patients. However, later DC (after 48h after stroke onset) might not have a benefit effect on lowering mortality or improving outcome in patients with malignant infarction. Together, this study suggested that decompressive surgery undertaken within 48 h reduced mortality and increased the number of patients with a favourable outcome in patients with malignant MCA infarction.

25387826|t|Electroacupuncture improves cerebral blood flow and attenuates moderate ischemic injury via Angiotensin II its receptors-mediated mechanism in rats.
25387826|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate the effects and potential mechanism of electroacupuncture intervention on expressions of Angiotensin II and its receptors-mediated signaling pathway in experimentally induced cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Totally 126 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group, model group and EA group. The latter two were further divided into ten subgroups (n = 6) following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO). Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and expressions of Angiotensin II and its receptors (AT1R, AT2R), as well as effector proteins in phosphatidyl inositol signal pathway were monitored before and at different times after MCAO. RESULTS: MCAO-induced decline of ipsilateral rCBF was partially suppressed by electroacupuncture, and contralateral blood flow was also superior to that of model group. Angiotensin II level was remarkably elevated immediately after MCAO, while electroacupuncture group exhibited significantly lower levels at 1 to 3 h and the value was significantly increased thereafter. The enhanced expression of AT1R was partially inhibited by electroacupuncture, while increased AT2R level was further induced. Electroacupuncture stimulation attenuated and postponed the upregulated-expressions of Gq and CaM these upregulations. ELISA results showed sharply increased expressions of DAG and IP3, which were remarkably neutralized by electroacupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: MCAO induced significant increases in expression of Angiotensin II and its receptor-mediated signal pathway. These enhanced expressions were significantly attenuated by electroacupuncture intervention, followed by reduced vasoconstriction and improved blood supply in ischemic region, and ultimately conferred beneficial effects on cerebral ischemia.

25141853|t|Association between estimated glomerular filtration rate and clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischaemic stroke: results from China National Stroke Registry.
25141853|a|BACKGROUND: the impact of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on stroke clinical outcomes remains controversial. We examined the association between eGFR and all-cause mortality, recurrent stroke, and stroke disability in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS: we analysed 8865 patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the China National Stroke Registry (CNSR) between September 2007 and August 2008. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between eGFR and 1-year all-cause mortality, recurrent stroke, and stroke disability. Low eGFR was defined as <45 ml/min/1.73 m(2). RESULTS: of 8865 acute ischaemic stroke patients included in the analysis, eGFR of <45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) occurred in 394 (4.4%), eGFR of 45-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in 675 (7.6%), eGFR of 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in 3533 (39.9%), and eGFR of ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in 4263 (48.1%) at baseline. Patients with reduced renal function were more likely to die, experience recurrent stroke or have stroke disability than patients with preserved renal function. After adjusting for both demographic and clinical risk factors, an eGFR of <45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) was independently associated with 1-year all-cause mortality (OR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.95-3.59) and recurrent stroke (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.51-2.56) but not for stroke disability defined as modified Rankin Score of 2-6 (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.95-1.67). These results were consistent in stratified analyses by age, diabetes or hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: a low eGFR was associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality and recurrent stroke independent of the traditional vascular risk factors in Chinese stroke patients.

25307434|t|Gene polymorphism of rs556621 but Not rs11984041 is associated with the risk of large artery atherosclerotic stroke in a Xinjiang Uyghur population.
25307434|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the main causes of death and adult chronic disability. Recently, 2 independent genome-wide association studies reported that the genetic variants (rs556621 and rs11984041) are significantly associated with large artery atherosclerosis (LAA). METHODS: To determine whether these 2 variants are associated with the pathogenesis of LAA in stroke patients from the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region of China, both variants were evaluated in a series of 733 LAA stroke patients (434 Han and 299 Uyghur) and 725 age-, gender-, smoking-, alcohol habits- and ethnicity-matched controls (401 Han and 324 Uyghur). RESULTS: For rs556621, significant differences in genotypic and allelic distributions were observed between Uyghur patients and controls (P = .045 for genotypic distribution, P = .042 for allelic distribution) but not in the Chinese Han cohort (P > .05). No significant differences were found in genotypic and allele distributions between patients and controls for rs11984041 in either the Chinese Han or Uyghur cohort (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The variant rs556621 but not rs11984041 may increase susceptibility of LAA stroke in the Xinjiang Uyghur population.

25294055|t|Rationale and design of a multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine SaiLuoTong in vascular dementia.
25294055|a|BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most prevalent type of dementia among the aged, for whom limited pharmacologic options are available so far. SaiLuoTong capsule is a modern traditional Chinese medicine formula, which has been demonstrated to improve cognition of VaD by the reports of animal experiments and preliminary clinical trial. However, evaluation of this therapy in randomized multicenter trials is needed. In this article, we present the rationale and design of the SaiLuoTong in Vascular Dementia Study. METHODS: This phase 2 clinical trial of SaiLuoTong among patients with mild-to-moderate VaD is a 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a subsequent 26-week, open-label extension. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, participants are centrally randomized (1:1:1) to 3 groups: group A receives SaiLuoTong 360 mg per day for 52 weeks; group B receives SaiLuoTong 240 mg per day for 52 weeks; group C (the control group) are further randomly assigned to 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio and receives placebo during the double-blind phase, then SaiLuoTong 360 mg per day or SaiLuoTong 240 mg per day during the extension phase. The primary outcome measures include the VaD assessment scale cognitive subscale and the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study-clinical global impression of change. Safety measures include body weight, vital signs, electrocardiography, laboratory tests, and records of adverse events. Assuming an attrition rate of 20%, at least 372 patients are required to obtain a statistical power of 80%. RESULTS: The first patient was enrolled into the study in April 2012 and the completion of the study is expected in September 2014. CONCLUSIONS: The rigorous methodology of the study will hopefully move forward the scientific evaluation of traditional Chinese medicine in treatment of VaD. The results of the present study will provide high-quality evidence on the effect of SaiLuoTong in patients with VaD and has the potential to establish a novel therapeutic approach for this disorder.

25018043|t|Mitochondria autophagy is induced after hypoxic/ischemic stress in a Drp1 dependent manner: the role of inhibition of Drp1 in ischemic brain damage.
25018043|a|Mitochondria dysfunction is implicated in diverse conditions, including metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. Mitochondrial dynamics has attracted increasing attention as to its relationship with mitochondria autophagy, also known as mitophagy, which is critical for degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Mitochondrial ﬁssion and its role in clearance of injured mitochondria in acute ischemic injury, however, have not been elucidated yet. Here we showed that hypoxic/ischemic conditions led to fragmentation of mitochondria and induction of mitophagy in permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) rats and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) PC12 cells. Inhibition of Drp1 by pharmacologic inhibitor or siRNA resulted in accumulation of damaged mitochondria mainly through selectively blocking mitophagy without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis and non-selective autophagy. Drp1 inhibitors increased the infarct volume and aggravated the neurological deﬁcits in a rat model of pMCAO. We demonstrated that the devastating role of disturbed mitochondrial fission by inhibiting Drp1 contributed to the damaged mitochondria-mediated injury such as ROS generation, cyt-c release and activation of caspase-3. Taken together, we proved that under hypoxic/ischemic stress a Drp1-dependent mitophagy was triggered which was involved in the removal of damaged mitochondria and cellular survival at the early stage of hypoxic/ischemic injury. Thus, Drp1 related pathway involved in selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria is proposed as an efficient target for treatment of cerebral ischemia.

25410062|t|Neuroprotective effects of electro acupuncture on hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in newborn rats Ass.
25410062|a|Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a common and potentially devastating condition in the neonate, associated with high mortality and morbidity. Effective treatment options are limited and therefore alternative therapies such as acupuncture are increasingly used. Previous studies have shown that electro acupuncture promoted proliferation of neural progenitor cell and increased expression of neurotrophic factor in HIE. However, effects of electro acupuncture on downstream signaling pathways have been rarely researched. So, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of electro acupuncture on HIE and to further investigate the role of GDNF family receptor member RET and its key downstream PI3-K/Akt pathway in the process. A rat HIE model was constructed by the left common carotid artery (LCCA) ligation method in combination with hypoxic treatment. Considering that Baihui (GV20), Dazhui (GV14), Quchi (LI11) and Yongquan (KI1) are commonly used in clinics for stroke treatment and are easy to locate, we chose the above four acupoints as the combination for electro acupuncture treatment which was performed once a day for different time periods. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and transmission electron microscopy results showed that electro acupuncture could ameliorate neurologic damage and alleviate the degenerative changes of ultra structure of cortical neurons in rats subjected to HIE. And the longer acupuncture treatment lasted, the better its therapeutic effect would be. This was accompanied by gradually increased expression of GDNF family receptor RET at the mRNA level and its downstream signaling Akt at the protein level in the ischemic cortex. These findings suggest that electro acupuncture shows neuroprotective effects in HIE, which at least in part is attributed to activation of PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway.

25213342|t|Predictors of carotid thickness and plaque progression during a decade: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
25213342|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque are noninvasive markers of subclinical arterial injury that predict incident cardiovascular disease. We evaluated predictors of longitudinal changes in IMT and new plaque during a decade in a longitudinal multiethnic cohort. METHODS: Carotid IMT and plaque were evaluated in Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants at exams 1 and 5, a mean (standard deviation) of 9.4 (0.5) years later. Far wall carotid IMT was measured in both common and internal carotid arteries. A plaque score was calculated from all carotid segments. Mixed-effects longitudinal and multivariate regression models evaluated associations of baseline risk factors and time-updated medication use with IMT progression and plaque formation. RESULTS: The 3441 MESA participants were aged 60.3 (9.4) years (53% women; 26% blacks, 22% Hispanic, 13% Chinese); 1620 (47%) had carotid plaque. Mean common carotid artery IMT progression was 11.8 (12.8) μm/year, and 1923 (56%) subjects developed new plaque. IMT progressed more slowly in Chinese (β=-2.89; P=0.001) and Hispanic participants (β=-1.81; P=0.02), and with higher baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (per 5 mg/dL; β=-0.22; P=0.03), antihypertensive use (β=-2.06; P=0.0004), and time on antihypertensive medications (years; β=-0.29; P<0.0001). Traditional risk factors were associated with new plaque formation, with strong associations for cigarette use (odds ratio, 2.31; P<0.0001) and protection by black ethnicity (odds ratio, 0.68; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multiethnic cohort with a decade of follow-up, ethnicity was a strong, independent predictor of carotid IMT and plaque progression. Antihypertensive medication use was associated with less subclinical disease progression.

25675557|t|[Impacts of yin-yang meridians acupuncture with respiratory reinforcing and reducing manipulation on lower limbs balance function in stroke patients].
25675557|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the impact on lower limbs balance function in treatment of yin-yang meridians acupuncture with respiratory reinforcing and reducing manipulation involved in the patients of stroke by applying B-PHY balance function test training system so as to provide the objective evidence in treatment of stroke; with acupuncture. METHODS: One hundred patients were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 50 cases in each one. In the control group, the basic treatment was applied, without other relevant rehabilitation therapies associated. In the observation group, with the basic treatment as the control group's, the therapy of the yin-yang meridians acupuncutre with respiratory reinforcing and reducing manipulation was adopted. On the yin meridians, Zuwuli (LR 10), Xuehai (SP 10), Yinlingquan (SP 9), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and the others were selected and stimulated with reducing manipulation achieved by the coordination of patient's respiration. On the yang meridians, Biguan (ST 31), Liangqiu (ST 34), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and the others were selected and stimulated with reinforcing manipulation achieved by the coordination of patient's respiration. The treatment was given once a day and for 28 days totally. Before treatment and in 28 days of treatment, B-PHY balance function test training system was used to determine the weight shift track parameters (track length, peripheral square, track length of per unit square, left-right offset and rectangle square), the weight shift track distance parameters [mean of X axle weight shift distance (Mean-X), mean of Y axle weight shift distance (Mean-Y), maximum of X axle weight shift distance (Max-X), maximum of Y axle weight shift distance (Max-Y), weight shift distance (LSKG), weight shift square (SSKG), square ratio of weight shift (LFS)], stability coefficient (SI) and weight distribution coefficient (WDI). RESULTS: After treatment, the differences in the weight shift track parameters, SI and WDI were significant as compared with those before treatment in the patients of the two groups (all P<0.01); while the differences in the weight shift distance parameters in the observation group were improved obviously after treatment as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.01), the differences of Mean-X, Max-Y and LFS in the control group were improved after treatment as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.01). Except SSKG, the improvements after treatment in the rest indices in the observation group were better than those in the control group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The yin-yang meridians acupuncture with respiratry reinforcing and re- ducing manipulation effectively improves the lower limbs balance function in the patients of stroke.

25335962|t|Efficacy and safety of ginger-salt-indirect moxibustion for urge urinary incontinence after stroke: protocol for a pilot multicentre randomised controlled trial.
25335962|a|INTRODUCTION: Ginger-salt-indirect moxibustion is widely applied to treat urge urinary incontinence after stroke, which is a common complication in stroke survivors. Moxa cone moxibustion and moxa box moxibustion are the main techniques of ginger-salt-indirect moxibustion. Our previous study had shown that ginger-salt-indirect moxibustion using moxa cones was feasible and effective for urination disorders post-stroke. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting research to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ginger-salt-indirect moxibustion for patients with post-stroke urge urinary incontinence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, prospective, single-blinded, pilot randomised controlled trial. 120 eligible patients will be randomly allocated to three groups. Treatment group A (n=40) will receive moxa cone moxibustion and routine care; treatment group B (n=40) will receive moxa box moxibustion and routine care; control group (n=40) will only receive routine care for stroke recovery. The entire moxibustion treatment will consist of a total of 28 sessions during the course of 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the increase in mean volume per void assessed at week 4 from the first moxibustion session (baseline). Secondary outcome measures will include mean frequency of urination per day and quality of life assessments measured by completion of the Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire and Barthel Index. All outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and at 4 and 16 weeks from baseline. Adverse events in the three groups will be recorded to assess the safety of moxibustion. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics was approved by the Research Ethical Committee of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to the Capital Medical University (ref: 2013BL-094). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Study results will be published in peer reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 44706974.

25549639|t|[Functional electrical stimulation based on a working pattern influences function of lower extremity in subjects with early stroke and effects on diffusion tensor imaging: a randomized controlled trial].
25549639|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the possible mechanisms for improving lower extremity motor function in patients with early stroke through combining magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technology and functional electrical stimulation (FES) based on human walking patterns. METHODS: From August 2012 to September 2013, a total of 48 eligible patients were stratified according to age, gender, disease course, Brunnstrom staging and types of stroke. And the Minimize software was used to divided them randomly into four-channel FES group (n = 18), dual-channel FES group (n = 15) and comfort stimulation group (n = 15). For all three groups, general medication and standard rehabilitation were provided. Based on normal walking pattern design of FES treatment, four-channel FES groups received the stimulations of quadriceps, hamstring, anterior tibialis and medial gastrocnemius. For the dual-channel FES group, the stimulations of tibialis anterior, peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles were applied. In comfort electrical stimulation group, the electrode positions were identical to the stimulation group, but there was no current output during stimulation. Before and after 3-week treatment, three groups received weekly rehabilitation evaluations of Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), posture assessment of stroke scale (PASS), Brunel balance assessment (BBA), Berg balance scale (BBS) and modified Barthel index (MBI). Before and after treatment, DTI examination was performed for some patients. RESULTS: Among three groups, general patient profiles and pre-treatment evaluations showed no significant difference. For intra-group comparisons versus pre-treatment, at week 1, 2 and 3, the scores of PASS, BBA, BBS, FMA and MBI had statistically significant differences (P < 0.05); At week 3 post-treatment, when four-channel and double-channel FES groups were compared versus pre-treatment, the scores of ipsilateral FA had statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). At week 1 post-treatment, MBI had statistically significant difference among 3 groups (P = 0.037). As compared with placebo, four-channel group had statistically significant difference [(52 ± 12) vs (38 ± 18), P < 0.05]; At week 2 post-treatment, the scores of PASS and MBI were (29 ± 3, 73 ± 13) in four-channel FES group versus (24 ± 8, 60 ± 17) in dual-channel FES group. And the scores of PASS, BBA, BBS, FMA and MBI were (9 ± 3, 8.3 ± 2.4, 37 ± 7, 22 ± 5, 73 ± 13) in four-channel FES group versus (21 ± 7, 6.2 ± 3.1, 24 ± 16, 15 ± 8, 47 ± 20) in comfort electrical stimulation group. When dual-channel FES and comfort stimulation groups were compared, MBI had significant statistical difference [(60 ± 17) vs (47 ± 20), P < 0.05]. At week 3 post-treatment, four-channel and dual-channel FES groups were compared, there was also statistical significance in FMA [(25 ± 5) vs (20 ± 7), P = 0.055]. The scores of PASS, BBS, FMA and MBI were (31 ± 3, 43 ± 8, 25 ± 5, 81 ± 13) in four-channel FES group versus (25 ± 8, 29 ± 17, 17 ± 9, 54 ± 25) in comfort stimulation group respectively. When dual-channel FES and comfort stimulation groups were compared, the scores of MBI were (71 ± 15) and (54 ± 25) respectively. And the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). At week 3 post-treatment, the scores of FA significantly increased [four-channel FES group (0.321 ± 0.172) vs comfort stimulation group (0.217 ± 0.135) (P = 0.020)]. When dual-channel FES group (0.333 ± 0.164) and comfort stimulation group (0.217 ± 0.135) (P = 0.049) were compared, the differences were statistically significant. DTI showed that four-channel FES group increased significantly, but contralateral fiber bundle was not obvious. And the improvements of dual-channel FES and comfort stimulation groups were insignificant. CONCLUSION: Compared with traditional dual-channel FES, functional electrical stimulation based on human walking patterns is more efficacious. And it helps to restore brain structure and function and promote motor function recovery in patients with early stroke.

24946143|t|Palmitoylation of STREX domain confers cerebroside sensitivity to the BKCa channel.
24946143|a|Our previous study reported that cerebrosides from traditional Chinese medicine Baifuzi directly interact with the STREX domain of BKCa channels, which in turn results in the therapeutic effect of Baifuzi on ischemic stroke. However, it is not known how cerebrosides in the plasma membrane could interact with the STREX domain that is in the cytoplasmic side. Using patch-clamp technique, effects of different cerebrosides on the BKCa channel were studied by measuring single channel currents in CHO cells expressing wild type or mutated BKCa channels. Palmitoylation of the STREX domain was removed either by site-directed mutagenesis or pharmacological inhibition. Removal of palmitoylation sites at C646 and C647 by mutating the residues to Ala abolished the ability of cerebrosides to activate the BKCa channel. In contrast, the mutation neither changed the single channel conductance nor voltage sensitivity of the channel. Both palmitoylation inhibitors tunicamycin and palmitic acid analog 2-bromopalmitate attenuated the activation of the BKCa channel by cerebrosides. Furthermore, confocal images on STREX-EGFP fragments demonstrated that STREX fragments no longer associated with the plasma membrane when the palmitoylation was removed or blocked. These findings suggest that palmitoylation of the STREX domain is necessary for cerebrosides to activate the BKCa channel and provide insight into the mechanism of how Baifuzi could exert therapeutic effect on ischemic stroke.

25098259|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (, BYHWD) on estradiol (E2) and estradiol receptor (ER) in serum and brain in ovariectomized rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: Adult female rats were ovariectomized and focal cerebral ischemic was induced by MCAO. Rats were randomly divided into normal, ovariectomy (OVX), MCAO, OVX+MCAO, OVX+MCAO+E2, and OVX+MCAO+BYHWD group. Rats were administered BYHWD 5 g/kg daily, estradiol valerate 500 μg/kg per day or distilled water for 7 consecutive days. Neuronal function and infarct volume were measured on day 7 after artery occlusion, and E2 and ER concentration in serum and brain were checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: BYHWD significantly improved the neurological behavior, reduced the infarction volume, increased E2 concentration in serum and brain, and increased ER concentration in the brain in ovariectomized rats after MCAO. CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective effects of BYHWD are associated with estrogen and its receptor.

25203634|t|Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling quantifies cerebral blood flow in patients with acute ischemic stroke and chronic lacunar stroke.
25203634|a|OBJECTIVE: We employed non-invasive pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) in infarcted and nearby neural regions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and chronic lacunar stroke (CLS). The results were compared with CBF in healthy individuals. METHODS: AIS and CLS patients were imaged with ASL, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and conventional MRI. CBF maps were created with 3DASL software. Two expert readers identified AIS and CLS lesions on conventional images, DWI images and CBF maps. A senior radiologist calculated CBF values for lesions and nearby regions. Lesion, nearby regions and normal corresponding region values were analyzed using a two-sample t-test. RESULTS: Fifty-six stroke patients (21 with AIS and 35 with CLS) and 30 healthy subjects participated in this study. In the AIS group, AIS lesions appeared in the cortex/white matter, external/internal capsule (EC/IC), and basal ganglia. AIS lesions had lower CBF values than the normal corresponding regions (p<0.05). The mean CBF values in AIS nearby regions were significantly higher than those in normal corresponding regions (p<0.05). In the CLS group, the CBF values in white matter and EC/IC were lower than the CBF values in normal corresponding regions (p=0.063 and 0.052, respectively). The CBF values in CLS nearby regions and normal corresponding regions were not significantly different (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: In some regions of the brain, CLS lesions, AIS lesions, and their nearby regions have different perfusion statuses. In particular, the AIS nearby regions perfusion in our subjects was significantly higher than that previously reported. pCASL can be a robust imaging technique for diagnosing strokes in clinical practices.

25231888|t|Prolinamide derivatives as thrombin inhibitors for the treatment of thrombin-mediated diseases: a patent evaluation of US2013296245.
25231888|a|INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic disorders can lead to deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. Thrombin plays a vital role in cascade reaction of blood coagulation, inhibition of the activity of thrombin can block the formation of thrombus and direct thrombin inhibitor has a prospect to overcome the limitations in application of the traditional anticoagulant drugs. AREAS COVERED: The current patent US2013296245 describes a series of prolinamide derivatives with formula (I) as thrombin inhibitors. These new compounds are defined to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acid and organic acid, and pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug where N-alkoxycarbonyl is protected or carboxylic acid is protected by ester. EXPERT OPINION: The patent used formamidine and its N-alkoxycarbonyl-protected derivatives as the P1 group; these groups were less basic compared with the traditional guanidine group, so their lipophilicity could be optimized to achieve oral absorption. Furthermore, these pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs where N-alkoxycarbonyl is protected or carboxylic acid is protected by ester could achieve prolonged half-life for a convenient once- or twice-daily oral dosing. These efforts gave a new hope and confidence to treat thrombotic disorders with selective and orally active thrombin inhibitors.

24869601|t|Meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of the new anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation.
24869601|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of the new oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation by the meta-analyses performed for 5 studies ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, and J-ROCKET. METHODS: The events including primary efficacy endpoint (stroke and systemic embolism), ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, and myocardial infarction were used for efficacy analysis and those including major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and gastrointestinal bleeding were used for safety analysis. Instead of combining both doses to 1 meta-analysis, the high-dose groups of RE-LY (150 mg twice daily) and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (60 mg twice daily) were combined with the single dose studies ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, and J-ROCKET. A separate meta-analysis was done for the low-dose groups of RE-LY (110 mg twice daily) and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (30 mg twice daily). RESULTS: The high-dose regimen had better performance than low dose in efficacy. In addition, low-dose regimen demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, and intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The new oral anticoagulants demonstrated promising alternatives to warfarin in prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.

24801159|t|A combination of four active compounds alleviates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in correlation with inhibition of autophagy and modulation of AMPK/mTOR and JNK pathways.
24801159|a|SMXZF is a combination of Rb1, Rg1, schizandrin, and DT-13 (6:9:5:4) derived from Sheng-mai San, a widely used Chinese traditional medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebral diseases. The present study explores the inhibitory effects and signaling pathways of SMXZF on autophagy induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion insult by right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 hr with subsequent 24 hr reperfusion. Three doses of SMXZF (4.5, 9, and 18 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) after ischemia for 1 hr. An autophagic inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA; 300 μg/kg), was administered i.p. 20 min before ischemia as a positive drug. We found that SMXZF significantly increased cerebral blood flow and reduced the infarct volume, brain water content, and the neurological deficits in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to the positive control, SMXZF at 18 mg/kg also significantly inhibited autophagosome formation. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting demonstrated that SMXZF could significantly decrease the expression levels of beclin1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3. SMXZF also remarkably inhibited the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as well as the expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its phosphorylation induced by 24 hr reperfusion. Finally, we demonstrated that the optimal administration time of SMXZF was at the early period of reperfusion. This study reveals that SMXZF displays neuroprotective effect against focal ischemia-reperfusion injury, possibly associated with autophagy inactivation through AMPK/mTOR and JNK pathways.

24993477|t|MLC901, a Traditional Chinese Medicine induces neuroprotective and neuroregenerative benefits after traumatic brain injury in rats.
24993477|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent and clinically highly heterogeneous neurological disorder with large socioeconomic consequences. NeuroAid (MLC601 and MLC901), a Traditional Medicine used in China for patients after stroke has been previously reported to induce neuroprotection and neuroplasticity. This study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of MLC901 in a rat model of TBI. TBI was induced by a moderate lateral fluid percussion applied to the right parietal cortex. MLC901 was injected intraperitoneally at 2h post-TBI, and then administered in drinking water at a concentration of 10mg/ml until sacrifice of the animals. The cognitive deficits induced by TBI were followed by using the "what-where-when" task, which allows the measurement of episodic-like memory. MLC901 treatment decreased brain lesions induced by TBI. It prevented the serum increase of S-100 beta (S100B) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), which may be markers to predict the neurologic outcome in human patients with TBI. MLC901 reduced the infarct volume when injected up to 2h post-TBI, prevented edema formation and assisted its resolution, probably via the regulation of aquaporin 4. These positive MLC901 effects were associated with an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as an increase of endogenous hippocampal neurogenesis and gliogenesis around the lesion. Furthermore, MLC901 reduced cognitive deficits induced by TBI. Rats subjected to TBI displayed a suppression of temporal order memory, which was restored by MLC901. This work provides evidence that MLC901 has neuroprotective and neurorestorative actions, which lead to an improvement in the recovery of cognitive functions in a model of traumatic brain injury.

24916704|t|Antioxidative effects of Panax notoginseng saponins in brain cells.
24916704|a|Oxidative stress resulting from accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in cell death associated with neurological disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury. Antioxidant compounds that improve endogenous antioxidant defenses have been proposed for neural protection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential protective effects of total saponin in leaves of Panax notoginseng (LPNS) on oxidative stress and cell death in brain cells in vitro. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay indicated that LPNS (5 μg/ml) reduced H2O2-induced cell death in primary rat cortical astrocytes (23±8% reduction in LDH release vs. control). Similar protection was found in oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation induced SH-SY5Y (a human neuroblastoma cell line) cell damage (78±7% reduction vs. control). The protective effects of LPNS in astrocytes were associated with attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. These effects involved activation of Nrf2 (nuclear translocation) and upregulation of downstream antioxidant systems including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1). These results demonstrate for the first time that LPNS has antioxidative effects which may be neuroprotective in neurological disorders.

24960183|t|Huangqi-Honghua combination and its main components ameliorate cerebral infarction with Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome by antioxidant action in rats.
24960183|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Combination of Radix Astragali (Huangqi) and Carthamus tinctorius L. (Honghua) has been extensively used as traditional herb medicine in China for the treatment of stroke and myocardial ischemia diseases with Qi deficiency and blood stasis (QDBS) syndrome. AIM: To investigate the effect of Huangqi-Honghua combination (HH) and its main components astragaloside IV (AS-IV) and Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) with QDBS in rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male rats were randomly divided into the following six groups: sham group, QDBS+I/R model group and treatment group including AS-IV, HSYA, AS-IV+HSYA and HH. The whole blood viscosity (WBV), plasma viscosity (PV), neurological examination, infarct volume, histopathology changes and some oxidative stress markers were assessed after 24h of reperfusion. RESULTS: HH and its main components AS-IV+HSYA could significantly decrease WBV, PV, and also significantly ameliorate neurological examination and infarct volume after 24h of reperfusion. They also significantly increased expression of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), activities of antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), led to decrease levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). CONCLUSION: AS-IV and HSYA are responsible for the main curative effects of HH. The study may provide scientific information to further understanding the mechanism(s) of HH and its main components in removing blood stasis and ameliorating cerebral infarction. Additionally, AS-IV and HSYA appear to have synergistic effects on neuroprotection.

24691925|t|Analysis of risk factors of hemorrhagic transformation after acute ischemic stroke: cerebral microbleeds do not correlate with hemorrhagic transformation.
24691925|a|To study the potential risk factors including cerebral microbleeds (CMB) of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after acute ischemic stroke. We included 348 consecutive patients with acute infarction who were hospitalized in two centers from June 2009 to December 2010. Acute ischemic infarctions were subdivided into atherosclerotic, cardioemblic, lacunar, and undetermined infarction groups. The related risk factors were recruited for analysis. All patients underwent gradient-echo T2-weighted imaging (GRE) to detect CMB and HT. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze relationships, with HT as response variable and potential risk factors as explanatory variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that predictor factors of HT were cardioembolic infarction (OR 24.956, 95 % CI 2.734-227.801, P = 0.004), infarction of undetermined causes (OR 19.381, 95 % CI 1.834-205.104, P = 0.014), and scores of NIHSS (OR 1.187, 95 % CI 1.109-1.292, P < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR 4.973, 95 % CI 2.004-12.338, P = 0.001). Whereas, the level of low-density lipoprotein was the protective factor (OR 0.654, 95 % CI 0.430-0.996, P = 0.048).The prevalence of CMB was 45.98 % (160/348) with no statistically difference among different subtypes. Thirty-five out of 348 (10.06 %) patients with ischemic stroke developed HT with a statistical difference among different subtypes of ischemia (χ (2) = 42.140, P < 0.001). The distributions of HI and PH among subgroups were variable with significant differences (χ (2) = 17.536, P = 0.001; χ (2) = 12.028, P = 0.007). PH frequency of cardioembolism was the highest (4/28, 14.29 %), and symptomatic ICH was also highest (7.14 %). The CMBs do not significantly correlate with HT. Knowledge of the risk factors associated with HT after ACI, especially HT following thrombolyitc therapy may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the development of HT, helps to develop treatment strategy that reduces the risk of PH and implicates for the design of future acute ischemic stroke trials.

24752475|t|Scutellaria baicalensis in stroke management: nature's blessing in traditional Eastern medicine.
24752475|a|Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is the most widely used medicinal plant in traditional Eastern medicine, especially in Chinese medicine. The major phytochemicals isolated from S. baicalensis are flavonoids, glycosides and their glucoronides such as baicalin, baicalein, wogonin etc. More than 30 different kinds of flavonoids are isolated from this plant. S. baicalensis and its flavonoids are reported to have several pharmacological activities, which includes anti-allergic, antioxidant, anti apoptic, anti-inflammatory effects and many more. Recently, S. baicalensis and its isolated flavonoids have been studied for their neuroprotective effects, through a variety of in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative diseases, plausibly suggesting that S. baicalensis has salutary effect as a nature's blessing for neuroprotection. In this review, we are focousing on the neuroprotective effects of S. baicalensis and its flavonoids in ischemia or stroke-induced neuronal cell death. We aimed at compiling all the information regarding the neuroprotective effect of S. baicalensis in various experimental models of cerebral ischemia or stroke.

24061692|t|Solid dispersion tablets of breviscapine with polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 for improved dissolution and bioavailability to commercial breviscapine tablets in beagle dogs.
24061692|a|Breviscapine, one of cardiovascular drugs extracted from a Chinese herb Erigeron breviscapinus, has been frequently used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, angina pectoris, coronary heart disease and stroke. However, its poor water solubility and low bioavailability in vivo severely restrict the clinical application. To overcome these drawbacks, breviscapine solid dispersion tablets consisting of breviscapine, polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP K30), microcrystalline cellulose and crospovidone were appropriately prepared. In vitro dissolution profiles showed that breviscapine released percentage of solid dispersion tablets reached 90 %, whereas it was only 40 % for commercial breviscapine tablets. Comparative pharmacokinetic study between solid dispersion tablets and commercial products was investigated on the normal beagle dogs after oral administration. Results showed that the bioavailability of breviscapine was greatly increased by 3.45-fold for solid dispersion tablets. The greatly improved dissolution rate and bioavailability might be attributed to intermolecular hydrogen bonding reactions between PVP K30 and scutellarin. These findings suggest that our solid dispersion tablets can greatly improve the bioavailability as well as the dissolution rate of breviscapine.

25276034|t|Adapted low intensity ergometer aerobic training for early and severely impaired stroke survivors: a pilot randomized controlled trial to explore its feasibility and efficacy.
25276034|a|[Purpose] To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of adapted low intensity ergometer aerobic training for early and severely impaired stroke survivors. [Subjects] The subjects were forty-eight early stroke survivors. [Methods] Eligible subjects were recruited and randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. Both groups participated in comprehensive rehabilitation training. Low intensity aerobic training was only performed by the experimental group. Outcome measures were the Fugl-Meyer motor score, Barthel index, exercise test time, peak heart rate, plasma glucose level and serum lipid profiles. [Results] Patients in the experimental group finished 88.6% of the total aerobic training sessions prescribed. In compliant participants (adherence≥80%), aerobic training significantly improved the Barthel index (from 40.1±21.1 to 79.2±14.2), Fugl-Meyer motor score (from 26.4±19.4 to 45.4±12.7), exercise test time (from 12.2±3.62 min to 13.9±3.6 min), 2-hour glucose level (from 9.22±1.16 mmol/L to 7.21±1.36 mmol/L) and homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistence index (from 1.72±1.01 to 1.28±0.88). [Conclusion] Preliminary findings suggest that early and severely impaired stroke patients may benefit from low intensity ergometer aerobic training.

24635389|t|Pharmaceutical properties of calycosin, the major bioactive isoflavonoid in the dry root extract of Radix astragali.
24635389|a|CONTEXT: Radix astragali (Fabaceae astragalus propinquus Schischkin) is a Chinese medicinal herb traditionally used for the treatment of several diseases. Calycosin is the major bioactive chemical in the dry root extract of this medical plant. OBJECTIVE: This work presents a brief overview of recent reports on the potential effects of calycosin on several diseases and the possible mechanisms of action of this chemical. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review gathers information from the scientific literature (before 1 June 2013) that was compiled from various databases, such as Science Direct, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. RESULTS: The potential pharmaceutical properties of calycosin in the treatment of tumors, inflammation, stroke, and cardiovascular diseases have gained increasing attention in the recent years. The literature survey showed that calycosin exhibits promising effects for the treatment of several diseases and that these effects may be due to its isoflavonoid and phytoestrogenic properties. The effects of calycosin most likely result from its interaction with the ER receptors on the cell membrane and the modulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Calycosin exhibits great potential as a therapeutic drug and may be a successful example of the standardization and modernization of traditional Chinese herbal medicine.

25335330|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of Yishen Jiejing Decoction (YJD) in treating poststroke shoulder-hand syndrome (SHS) patients of yin deficiency yang hyperactivity with blood stasis stagnation collaterals syndrome. METHODS: Totally 60 SHS patients of yin deficiency yang hyperactivity with blood stasis stagnation collaterals syndrome were randomly assigned to two groups, the treatment group and the control group, 30 cases in each group. Conventional rehabilitation training and therapeutics were applied in all patients. Besides, patients in the treatment group took 50 mL YJD, twice a day. One month without interruption consisted of one course of treatment. The curative effects of each group were evaluated respectively before treatment and at one month after treatment. The neurologic impairment, TCM syndrome, and the improvement of upper limbs movement were assessed by the neurologic impairment integral, scoring for TCM syndrome diagnostics, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (U-FMA). Adverse reactions were observed at the same time. RESULTS: The effective rate of stroke was 86.67% and the effective rate of SHS was 90.00% in the treatment group, higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Both groups got improvement in neurologic impairment, stroke induced blood stasis syndrome, yin deficiency yang hyperactivity syndrome, and the improvement of upper limbs movement after treatment (all P < 0.05). Besides, all the improvement was obviously superior in the treatment group (P < 0. 05). No adverse reaction occurred during the course of treatment. CONCLUSION: The curative effect of YJD combined with conventional rehabilitation training was confirmative and superior to the control group.

25532388|t|[Real-world analysis of concurrent diseases and medicine use among patients with insomnia].
25532388|a|This study aims to explore and analyze the condition of concurrent diseases and medicine use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medicine among the patients with insomnia. One thousand and sxity seven cases of data from 20 national hospitals' hospital information system (HIS) databases were collected. The frequent concurrent diseases included hypertension (26.9%), brain blood supply insufficiency (24.93%), cerebral infarction (19.49%), blood lipoprotein disturbance (15.28%), coronary heart disease (14.15%), headache (10.68%), chronic gastritis (8.81%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (7.87%), depressive disorder (7.4%) and anxiety disorder (6.65%). The 10 most frequently-used western drugs included alprazolam (35.99%), aspirin (25.4%), olanzapine (24.18%), cinepazide (23.06%), flupentixol & melitracen (18.74%), zolpidem (18.37%), oxiracetam (15.65%), estazolam (15%), aniracetam (13.4%) and piracetam (13.31%). The 10 most frequently-used TCM included Shuxuening injection (16.4%), Shuxuetong injection (15.18%), extract of ginkgo biloba leaf (14.71%), gastrodin (12.46%), Dengzanxixin injection (11.34%), Xueshuantong (8.53%), Danhong injection (6.37%), compound liquorice tablet (5.81%), Sanqi Tongshu capsule (5.72%) and sowthistle-leaf ixeridium injection (5.34%). Among all combined uses, the most frequent western drug use was alprazolam and olanzapine, while combined use of hypnotic drug and Huoxuehuayu formula is the most frequent. This study concludes that the concurrent diseases mainly include cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, metabolic disorders and anxiety-depression disorders, with increasing tendency of diseases types by ages, especially for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. The most frequently-used hypnotic is alprazolam in the insomnia patients, and it is worth being concerned about the off-label use of olanzapine as an antipsychotic for the treatment of insomnia However, due to the fact that all cases data are from the inpatients, these findings have some limitations.

25120903|t|Vascular disruption and blood-brain barrier dysfunction in intracerebral hemorrhage.
25120903|a|This article reviews current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the initial hemorrhage and secondary blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in primary spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in adults. Multiple etiologies are associated with ICH, for example, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, vascular malformations and coagulopathies (genetic or drug-induced). After the initial bleed, there can be continued bleeding over the first 24 hours, so-called hematoma expansion, which is associated with adverse outcomes. A number of clinical trials are focused on trying to limit such expansion. Significant progress has been made on the causes of BBB dysfunction after ICH at the molecular and cell signaling level. Blood components (e.g. thrombin, hemoglobin, iron) and the inflammatory response to those components play a large role in ICH-induced BBB dysfunction. There are current clinical trials of minimally invasive hematoma removal and iron chelation which may limit such dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the initial hemorrhage and secondary BBB dysfunction in ICH is vital for developing methods to prevent and treat this devastating form of stroke.

25099775|t|The synergistic effect of acupuncture and computer-based cognitive training on post-stroke cognitive dysfunction: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of 2 × 2 factorial design.
25099775|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the most common causes of cognitive impairment. Up to 75% of stroke survivors may be considered to have cognitive impairment, which severely limit individual autonomy for successful reintegration into family, work and social life. The clinical efficacy of acupuncture with Baihui (DU20) and Shenting (DU24) in stroke and post-stroke cognitive impairment has been previously demonstrated. Computer-assisted cognitive training is part of conventional cognitive rehabilitation and has also shown to be effective in improvement of cognitive function of affected patients. However, the cognitive impairment after stroke is so complexity that one single treatment cannot resolve effectively. Besides, the effects of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training have not been systematically compared, nor has the possibility of a synergistic effect of combination of the two therapeutic modalities been evaluated. Our primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the synergistic effect of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training on cognitive dysfunction after stroke. METHOD/DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial of 2 × 2 factorial design will be conducted in the Rehabilitation Hospital Affiliated to Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. A total of 240 patients with cognitive dysfunction after stroke who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomized into RehaCom training group, acupuncture group, a combination of both or control group in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. All patients will receive conventional treatment. The interventions will last for 12 weeks (30 min per day, Monday to Friday every week). Evaluations will be conducted by blinded assessors at baseline and again at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Outcome measurements include mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessments (MoCA), functional independence measure scale (FIM) and adverse events. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial are expected to clarify the synergistic effect of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training on cognitive dysfunction after stroke. Furthermore, to confirm whether combined or alone of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training, is more effective than conventional treatment in the management of post-stroke cognitive dysfunction. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR-TRC-13003704.

25333051|t|Low awareness of stroke guidelines and preference for Chinese herbs in community physicians: a national survey in China.
25333051|a|BACKGROUND: Physicians' adherence to stroke guidelines is becoming a critical part of public stroke care system. The objective of this national survey was to examine Chinese physicians' awareness of the guidelines in secondary stroke prevention. METHODS: This is a non-commercial and no-incentive internet survey. Respondents were asked to perform a self-examination of 13 questions regarding their stroke practice. Their awareness of stroke guidelines, preference for Chinese traditional herbs (CTH), and patients' expense for stroke treatment were surveyed and compared between physicians from community and from tertiary hospitals using univariate analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 8,581 physicians (70.1% from community hospitals) responded to the survey. Only 32.1% physicians considered risk factors control necessary for stroke. For the treatments of symptomatic carotid stenosis, only 10.4% physicians selected carotid endarterectomy and anti-platelet plus controlling stroke risk factors. Only 21.45% physicians selected warfarin anticoagulation for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. In contrast, a high percentage (64.56%) of physicians had positive attitude towards CTH. Compared with those from tertiary hospitals, community physicians were more likely unaware of the guidelines and preferred CTH. Those who prescribed CTH reported more patients' cost (P<0.001, OR 1.78, 95% CI, 1.55-2.04) than who didn't. CONCLUSIONS: There is a very low awareness of stroke guidelines in Chinese community physicians. A well-organized continuing stroke-guidelines education should be an essential part of public stroke-care system in China. Also, more well-designed clinical trials are required to establish the safety and effectiveness of CTH.

25087603|t|Cost-effectiveness analysis of combined Chinese medicine and Western medicine for ischemic stroke patients.
25087603|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of combining Chinese medicine (CM) with Western medicine (WM) for ischemic stroke patients. METHODS: Hospitalization summary reports between 2006 and 2010 from eight hospitals in Beijing were used to analyze the length of stay (LOS), cost per stay (CPS), and outcomes at discharge. RESULTS: Among 12,009 patients (female, 36.44%; mean age, 69.98±13.06 years old), a substantial number of patients were treated by the WM_Chinese patent medicine (CPM)_Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) (38.90%); followed by the WM_CPM (32.55%), the WM (24.26%), and the WM_CHM (4.15%). With adjustment for confounding variables, LOS of the WM_CPM_CHM group was about 10 days longer than that of the WM group, and about 6 days longer than that of the WM_CPM group or the WM_CHM group (P<0.01); CPS of the WM_CPM_CHM group was United States dollar (USD) 1,288 more than that of the WM group, and about USD 600 more than that of the WM_CPM group or the WM_CHM group (P<0.01). Compared with the WM group, odd ratio (OR) of recovered and improved outcome of the WM_CPM_CHM group was the highest [OR: 12.76, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 9.23, 17.64, P<0.01], OR of death outcome of the WM_CPM_CHM group was the lowest (OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.12, P<0.01). There was no significant difference between LOS, CPS and OR of the WM_CPM group and those of the WM_CHM group (P>0.05). Cost/effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the WM_CPM_CHM group were robustly higher than those of the WM group. CONCLUSION: Compared with WM alone, supplementing CPM and CHM to WM provides significant health benefits of improving the chance of recovered and improved outcome, and reducing the death rate, at an expense of longer LOS and higher CPS.

24746110|t|Longitudinal study of diffusion tensor imaging properties of affected cortical spinal tracts in acute and chronic hemorrhagic stroke.
24746110|a|This study investigated the clinical value of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in predicting the motor outcome in patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage. This prospective study included 23 patients assessed with DTI to measure the fractional anisotropy (FA) value in affected cortical spinal tract (CST) at three time points: day 0, day 30 and day 90 after onset. The motor function score (MFS) was applied to evaluate motor function and patients were divided into good and poor outcome groups according to the MFS on day 90. The mean FA value on day 0 was significantly lower in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group (p<0.01). FA value gradually decreased in the poor outcome group until day 90 after onset, while it continuously increased in the good outcome group. The MFS obtained at day 90 after onset was significantly correlated with the initial FA value in the affected cerebral peduncle (r=-0.926, p<0.01). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the FA value on day 0 could predict motor function outcome with a sensitivity of 88.89% and specificity of 92.86% at the initial FA value of 0.45. The FA value of affected CST in acute cerebral hemorrhage may valuably predict the motor function outcome and its dynamic change may represent the Wallerian degeneration in motor tracts after hemorrhagic stroke.

25317157|t|Pretreatment with Danhong injection protects the brain against ischemia-reperfusion injury.
25317157|a|Danhong injection (DHI), a Chinese Materia Medica standardized product extracted from Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae and Flos Carthami tinctorii, is widely used in China for treating acute ischemic stroke. In the present study, we explored the neuroprotective efficacy of DHI in a rat model of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion, and evaluated the potential mechanisms underlying its effects. Pretreatment with DHI (0.9 and 1.8 mL/kg) resulted in a significantly smaller infarct volume and better neurological scores than pretreatment with saline. Furthermore, DHI significantly reduced the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, increased occludin protein expression and decreased neutrophil infiltration, as well as profoundly suppressing the upregulation of matrix metallopeptidase-9 expression seen in rats that had received vehicle. Matrix metallopeptidase-2 expression was not affected by ischemia or DHI. Moreover, DHI (1.8 mL/kg) administered 3 hours after the onset of ischemia also improved neurological scores and reduced infarct size. Our results indicate that the neuroprotective efficacy of DHI in a rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury is mediated by a protective effect on the blood-brain barrier and the reversal of neutrophil infiltration.

25061971|t|The association between serum leptin and post stroke depression: results from a cohort study.
25061971|a|BACKGROUND: Depression is a frequent mood disorder that affects around a third of stroke patients and has been associated with poorer outcomes. Our aim was to determine whether there was a relationship between inflammatory markers (leptin) and post-stroke depression (PSD). METHODS: One hundred and ninety-one ischemic stroke patients admitted to the hospital within the first 24 hours after stroke onset were consecutively recruited and followed up for 3 months. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure serum levels of leptin at admission. Based on the symptoms, diagnoses of depression were made in accordance with DSM-IV criteria for post-stroke depression at 3 month. RESULTS: Forty-four patients (23.0%) were diagnosed as having major depression at 3 month. Patients with depression showed higher serum leptin levels at 3 month after stroke (32.2 [IQR, 20.8-57.7] v. 9.9 [IQR, 4.6-13.1]ng/ml, respectively; P = 0.000). Serum levels of leptin ≥20 ng/ml were independently associated with PSD [odds ratio (OR) 20.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.11-51.26, P = 0.000], after adjusting for possible confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Serum leptin levels elevated at admission were found to be associated with PSD and may provide a new proposal for the treatment of PSD.

25055851|t|Weight loss herbal intervention therapy (W-LHIT) a non-appetite suppressing natural product controls weight and lowers cholesterol and glucose levels in a murine model.
25055851|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity is increasing in industrialized countries. Obesity increases the risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, cancer, hypertension, and type-2 diabetes. Unfortunately, conventional obesity drug treatment is often associated with adverse effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate a novel natural formula, Weight loss herbal intervention therapy (W-LHIT), developed from traditional Chinese medicine, for weight control in a high-fat-diet (HFD) induced obesity murine model. METHODS: Two sets of experiments were performed. In experiment 1, 14-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice were fed with HFD for 21 days and then separated into 3 weight-matched groups. One group continued on the HFD as obese-controls. Two groups were switched from HFD to normal fat level diet (NFD) and sham or W-LHIT treated. In experiment 2, 25-week-old obese mice, following 2 weeks acclimatization, received either W-LHIT or sham treatment while maintained on HFD. In both sets of experiments, NFD fed, age matched normal weight mice served as normal controls. Body weight and food intake were recorded. Epididymal fat pad weight, serum glucose and cholesterol levels, as well as PPARγ and FABP4 gene expression in epididymal fat tissue were analyzed at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: In experiment 1, W-LHIT treated obese mice lost body weight 12.2 ± 3.8% whereas sham treated mice lost 5.5 ± 2.8% by day 10 after switching from the HFD to the NFD, without reduction of chow consumption. In experiment 2, W-LHIT treated obese mice maintained on the HFD had significantly lower body weight (8 fold less) than the sham treated mice. W-LHIT treatment also reduced epididymal fat pad weight, blood cholesterol and glucose levels versus sham treated mice without reduced chow consumption. In addition, significantly increased PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ) and FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein 4) gene expression were found in epdidymal fat tissues. Liver and kidney function and hematology testing results of W-LHIT treated mice were within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: W-LHIT significantly and safely reduced body weight, normalized glucose and cholesterol levels in obese mice, without suppression of appetite, and increased adipocyte PPARγ and FABP4 gene expression.

25044172|t|Community-applied research of a traditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation scheme on Broca's aphasia after stroke: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
25044172|a|BACKGROUND: Aphasia is a common and severely disabling complication in stroke patients. It usually brings about lower rates of functional recovery, longer rehabilitation length of stay (LOS), and significantly poorer LOS efficiency (LOS-Eff), resulting in higher rehabilitation costs compared to patients without aphasia. It also decreases the quality of life and increases the mortality of stroke patients. The evidence currently available suggests that the effect of acupuncture combined with language training for apoplectic aphasia is statistically better than speech and language therapy (SLT) alone, but there remains a lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials. Acupuncture combined with language training is relatively low-cost and especially suitable for community-based rehabilitation for aphasia patients after stroke, taking its medical and health facilities which are always deficient in manpower and material resources into account. The aim of the present study is to develop an effective standard therapeutic program for apoplectic aphasia in communities. METHODS/DESIGN: In a randomized controlled clinical trial with blinded assessment, 290 eligible patients with aphasia due to stroke will be randomly allocated into a control group or an experimental group. The course of this trial will comprise a 4-week intervention and a 12-week follow-up period. Five assessment points, including baseline, 2 and 4 weeks after treatment, 6 and 12 weeks after follow-up, are set to dynamically observe the changes of curative effects. Primary outcome measures are the differences in the score on both the China rehabilitation research center aphasia examination (CRRCAE) and Boston diagnostic aphasia examination - Chinese version (BDAE-C) after intervention and follow-up. The Modified Barthel Index (MBI), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and results of blood oxygen level dependent-functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) examination are considered as the secondary outcome measures. Other outcomes will include rate of adverse events and economic effects. DISCUSSION: If the outcome is positive, this project will offer a low-cost appropriate technology for community health centers (CHCs) in the rehabilitation of aphasia patients after stroke, and could be implemented on a large scale, both in China and worldwide. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR-TRC-13003703. Registration date: 18 October 2013.

24751713|t|Emodin accentuates atrial natriuretic peptide secretion in cardiac atria.
24751713|a|Emodin, an active anthraquinone constituent isolated from the rhubarb, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine which is widely used in clinical treatment, has cardiovascular protective properties. However, it remains unclear whether the cardiovascular protective actions of emodin are related to an activation of cardiac natriuretic hormone secretion. The purpose of the present study was to explore the effect of emodin on the secretion of ANP, a member of the family of cardiac natriuretic hormones, and its mechanisms involved. Experiments were performed in isolated perfused beating rabbit atria allowing measurement of ANP secretion, atrial pulse pressure, and stroke volume. Emodin increased ANP secretion concomitantly with a decrease in atrial pulse pressure and stroke volume in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects were reversible. Inhibition of K(+) channels with tetraethylammonium and glibenclamide attenuated the emodin-induced changes in ANP secretion and atrial dynamics. Furthermore, the emodin-induced changes in ANP secretion and atrial dynamics were attenuated by inhibition of L-type Ca(2+) channels with nifedipine. Atropine, methoctramine, tertiapin-Q, and pertussis toxin had no significant effect on the emodin-induced changes in ANP secretion and mechanical dynamics. The present study demonstrates that emodin increases ANP secretion via inhibition of L-type Ca(2+) channels through an activation of K(+)ATP channel in isolated beating rabbit atria. The results also provide a rationale for the use of emodin in the treatment of impairment of the regulation of the cardiovascular homeostasis.

24962764|t|Comparison of administration routes for adipose-derived stem cells in the treatment of middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.
24962764|a|Given that adult adipose tissue is an abundant, accessible and safe source of stem cells, the use of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) provides a promising approach in ischemic stroke. The delivery route, however, for transplantation of ADSCs in clinical application remains controversial regarding the time window, cell type, safety issues, 'first pass' effect and therapeutic effect. To determine the optimal administration route in transplantation of ADSCs, we compared the therapeutic effect of the three mainly used administration routes of ADSCs in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. Cells isolated from the adipose tissue of adult rodents were differentiated and characterized in vitro, and further transplanted in vivo by intravenous, intra-arterial or intra-ventricular delivery. The infarct volume, expression of neurotrophic factors and the neurobehavioral improvements were evaluated after the equal dose of BrdU labeled ADSCs transplantation. Our results indicated that the equal dose of ADSCs delivered intravenously were effective in improving the neurological outcome and reducing the infarct volume after ischemic brain injury in long term duration in contrast to intra-arterial and intra-ventricular delivery. At 1-7 days after transplantation, the increased expression levels of BDNF, VEGF, bFGF, Bcl-2, IL-10 and decreased levels of caspase-3 and TNF-α in the intra-ventricular and intra-arterial groups were significant in contrast to the intravenous group. There was no significant difference among the three groups after 7 days. Our findings suggest that compared with the intra-ventricular delivery, intravascular injection allows higher dose injection with fewer invasions and appears to be optimal in application with regard to therapeutic efficacy, safety and feasibility.

24944615|t|Monoamine neurotransmitters and fibroblast growth factor-2 in the brains of rats with post-stroke depression.
24944615|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in the levels of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in the brains of rats with post-stroke depression (PSD). A rat model of stroke was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion and the rats were randomly divided into two groups: Control and modification groups. The rats in the modification group had PSD, while the rats in the control group had experienced a stroke only. The PSD model was established by applying chronic mild stress to the individually housed rats. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to detect the levels of 5-HT, DA and NE, while western blotting was used to detect the FGF-2 protein expression levels in the frontal lobe and hippocampus. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was also used to determine the mRNA expression levels of FGF-2 in the frontal lobes of the two groups. The levels of 5-HT, DA and NE in the frontal lobe and hippocampus of the rats in the PSD group were significantly lower than the levels observed in the rats in the stroke group (P<0.01). In addition, protein expression levels of FGF-2 in the frontal lobe of the rats in the PSD group were significantly lower when compared with the control group rats (P<0.01), however, the protein expression levels of FGF-2 in the hippocampus did not exhibit a statistically significant difference (P>0.05). The mRNA expression levels of FGF-2 in the frontal lobe of the rats in the modification group were significantly lower than the levels in the control group rats (P<0.01). Therefore, reduced levels of monoamine neurotransmitters and FGF-2 expression in the brains of rats with PSD are associated with the incidence of PSD.

24915606|t|A meta-analysis of acupuncture use in the treatment of cognitive impairment after stroke.
24915606|a|OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture on cognitive impairment (function) after a stroke. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with no acupuncture in addition to medicine or rehabilitation were identified from databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Chinese Periodical Database, Wangfang Chinese Periodical Database, Chinese Bio-medicine Database, Cochrane Library, and Chinese medical literature databases) and two relevant journals (Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion and the Journal of Shanghai Acupuncture and Moxibustion). Meta-analyses were conducted for the eligible RCTs. RESULTS: Twenty-one trials with a total of 1421 patients met inclusion criteria. Pooled random-effects estimates of the change in the Mini-Mental State Examination were calculated for the comparison of acupuncture with no acupuncture in addition to medicine or rehabilitation. Following 4 weeks and 8 weeks of intervention with acupuncture, the merged mean difference was 3.14 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.06-4.21; p<.00001) and 2.03 (95% CI, 0.26-3.80; p=0.02), respectively. For the comparison of 3-4 weeks of acupuncture with no acupuncture in addition to medicine or rehabilitation groups, the merged MD in Neurobehavioral Cognitive State Examination total scores was 5.63 (95% CI, 3.95-7.31; p<.00001). For the comparison of 8-12 weeks of acupuncture with no acupuncture in addition to medicine or rehabilitation groups, the P300 latency merged MD was -12.80 (95% CI, -21.08 to -4.51; p<.00001), while the P300 amplitude merged MD was 1.38 (95% CI, 0.93-1.82; p<.00001). Overall, the study quality was rated as moderate on the basis of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (part 2: 8.5). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that acupuncture had positive effects on cognitive function after stroke and supports the need for additional research on the potential benefits of this therapeutic approach.

25221578|t|Neuroprotective effect of the traditional Chinese herbal formula Tongxinluo: a PET imaging study in rats.
25221578|a|Tongxinluo has been widely used in China for the treatment of acute stroke and for neuroprotection. However, there are few positron emission tomography (PET) studies on the neuroprotective effect of Tongxinluo on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in small animals. In the present study, Tongxinluo superfine powder suspension or its vehicle was administered intragastrically to rats for 5 successive days before middle cerebral artery occlusion. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) small animal PET imaging showed that at 1 and 2 weeks after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, glucose metabolism in the ischemic area was greater in rats that had received Tongxinluo than in those that had received the vehicle. Nissl staining showed that 2 weeks after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, there was less neuronal loss in the prefrontal cortex in Tongxinluo-treated rats than in controls. In addition, Tongxinluo-treated animals showed better neurologic function and lower cerebral infarct volume than rats that received the vehicle. These findings suggest that Tongxinluo exhibits neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and demonstrates that (18)F-FDG small animal PET imaging is a useful tool with which to study the molecular pharmacology of traditional Chinese medicine.

25137841|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze and summarize changes of syndrome-related biological indices in acute lacuna encephalon infarction patients of upper hyperactivity of Gan yang syndrome (UHGYS), thus providing objective evidence for syndrome typing and disease identification. METHODS: Recruited were 50 patients at Department of Encephalopathy, Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, who were in line with diagnostic criteria of UHGYS as the experimental group in this study. Another 40 healthy volunteers were recruited as the control group from May 2010 to July 2012. Blood routines (including WBC, RBC, Hb, NEUT%, and LY%), hepatic and renal functions tests (including ALT, AST, TBIL, TP, ALB, Cr, and BUN) were performed by automatic whole blood analyzer and colorimetric technique. The levels of fasting blood glucose, HbAlc, blood lipids (including TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, and VLDL-C), and coagulation functions (including AT-III, PT, PTA, INR, TT, APTT, and FBG, reaction time), renin, angiotensin II, hs-CRP, and Hcy were also measured. The thyroid functions (including FT3, FT4, T3, T4, and TSH) were detected by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and IL-1 in serum were measured by ELISA and radioimmunoassay respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, RBC, LY%, ALT, TP, ALB, HDL-C, AT-III activities, contents of PTA and FT4 obviously decreased, TBIL, BUN, Glu, HbAlc, TSH, hs-CRP, renin, Ang II, TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 significantly increased in the experimental group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The pathological process of acute lacuna encephalon infarction patients of UHGYS was closely correlated with thyroid functions, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation systems, as well as inflammation reaction.

24933211|t|Notoginsenoside R1 attenuates atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE deficient mouse model.
24933211|a|AIMS: Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. The current study evaluated the interventional effects of a naturally occurring compound Notoginsenoside R1 (NR1) on atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: The atherosclerotic lesion was significantly alleviated by NR1 treatment and this attenuation was marked by reduction in lipid deposition, fibrosis and oxidative stress. Increased serum levels of GSH and SOD and decreased level of MDH were observed in NR1-treated ApoE-/- mice. NR1 treatment also significantly decreased the levels of CHO, TG, ox-LDL and increased the level of HDL. Additionally, the levels of inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α and γ-IFN were markedly reduced in NR1-treated ApoE-/- mice. Furthermore, significantly increased aortic expression of miR-26a, miR-21, miR-126a, miR-132, miR-146 and miR-155 and decreased expression of miR-20a and miR-92a were observed in the vehicle-treated ApoE-/- mice. While NR1 treatment led to a significant reduction in the expression of miR-21, miR-26a, miR-126 and increased expression of miR-20a. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results demonstrated for the first time the anti-atherosclerotic effects of NR1, which could be in part mediated through its multiple targeting effects on inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and microRNA expression. These results therefore justify further evaluation of NR1 as a therapeutic agent treating atherosclerosis.

24927275|t|Modulatory effect of acupuncture at Waiguan (TE5) on the functional connectivity of the central nervous system of patients with ischemic stroke in the left basal ganglia.
24927275|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of acupuncture at Waiguan (TE5) on the functional connectivity of the central nervous system of patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with ischemic stroke in the left basal ganglia were randomized based on gender to receive TE5 acupuncture (n = 12) or nonacupoint acupuncture (n = 12). Each group underwent sham acupuncture and then verum acupuncture while being scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Six regions of interest (ROI) were defined, including bilateral motor, somatosensory, and bilateral basal ganglia areas. The functional connectivity between these ROIs and all voxels of the brain was analyzed in Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) to explore the differences between verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture at TE5 and between TE5 acupuncture and nonacupoint acupuncture. The participants were blinded to the allocation. RESULT: The effect of acupuncture on six seed-associated networks was explored. The result demonstrated that acupuncture at Waiguan (TE5) can regulate the sensorimotor network of the ipsilesional hemisphere, stimulate the contralesional sensorimotor network, increase cooperation of bilateral sensorimotor networks, and change the synchronization between the cerebellum and cerebrum. Furthermore, a lot of differences of effect existed between verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture at TE5, but there was little difference between TE5 acupuncture and nonacupoint acupuncture. CONCLUSION: The modulation of synchronizations between different regions within different brain networks might be the mechanism of acupuncture at Waiguan (TE5). Stimulation of the contralesional sensorimotor network and increase of cooperation of bilateral hemispheres imply a compensatory effect of the intact hemisphere, whereas changes in synchronization might influence the sensorimotor function of the affected side of the body.

24751364|t|Preconditioning with the traditional Chinese medicine Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang initiates HIF-1α-dependent neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia in rats.
24751364|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT) is a classical heat-clearing and detoxicating formula of traditional Chinese medicine that is widely used to treat stroke. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of HLJDT preconditioning on neurons under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A stroke model of rats was obtained through MCAO. Following HLJDT preconditioning, the cerebral infarction volume, cerebral water content, and neurological deficient score were determined. Cerebral cortical neurons cultured in vitro were preconditioned with HLJDT and then subjected to OGD treatment. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from neurons was detected. The levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and PI3K/Akt signaling were analyzed by western blotting, and the levels of erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the supernatant of the neurons and the plasma of MCAO rats were measured through a radioimmunological assay. The apoptosis and proliferation of neurons were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: HLJDT preconditioning significantly reduced the cerebral infarction volume and cerebral water content and ameliorated the neurological deficient score of MCAO rats. In addition, HLJDT preconditioning protected neurons against OGD. Increased HIF-1α, EPO, and VEGF levels and the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling were observed as a result of HLJDT preconditioning. Furthermore, HLJDT preconditioning was found to inhibit ischemia-induced neuron apoptosis and to promote neuron proliferation under conditions of ischemia/reperfusion. CONCLUSION: Both rats and neurons subjected to HLJDT preconditioning were able to resist ischemia/reperfusion or hypoxia injury through the inhibition of apoptosis and the enhancement of proliferation, and these effects were primarily dependent on the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and HIF-1α.

24926338|t|Electroacupuncture attenuates cervical spinal cord injury following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive rats.
24926338|a|Cerebral ischemia induces injury, not only in the ischemic core and surrounding penumbra tissues, but also in remote areas such as the cervical spinal cord. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on cervical spinal cord injury following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive (RHRSP) rats. The results demonstrated that neuronal loss, which was assayed by Nissl staining in the cervical spinal cords of RHRSP rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), was markedly decreased by EA stimulation at the GV20 (Baihui) and GV14 (Dazhui) acupoints compared with that in rats undergoing sham stimulation. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis demonstrated that EA stimulation blocked the MCAO-induced elevated protein expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and amyloid precursor protein in the cervical spinal cord at days 24 and 48. To further investigate the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective role of EA stimulation, the protein expression levels of Nogo-A and Nogo-66 receptor-1 (NgR1), two key regulatory molecules for neurite growth, were recorded in each group. The results revealed that EA stimulation reduced the MCAO-induced elevation of Nogo-A and NgR1 protein levels at day 14 and 28 in RHRSP rats. Therefore, the results demonstrated that EA reduced cervical spinal cord injury following cerebral ischemia in RHRSP rats, indicating that EA has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic treatment agent for cervical spinal cord injury following stroke.

24638971|t|Electroacupuncture promotes neural cell proliferation in vivo through activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
24638971|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on cell proliferation and its molecular mechanisms. Sixty rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham operation control (SC), ischemia control (IC), EA, EA and DMSO injection (ED), EA and U0126 injection (EU). All the groups, with the exception of SC, underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and DMSO or U0126 was injected into the rat in the ED or EU group 30 min prior to MCAO. Cell proliferation was evaluated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining. The changes of cell cycle proteins (cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, CDK2, p21 and p27) and the ERK1/2 pathway activation were examined by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The results showed that the positive cell numbers of PCNA immunostaining in the EA and ED groups were more than those in the IC group (P<0.05). The mRNA and protein levels of p21 or p27 were obviously increased, however, the mRNA and protein levels of cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E and CDK2 were reduced in the IC and EU groups. The findings suggested that EA activates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to protect brain injury during cerebral ischemia. However, this positive effect of EA can be blocked by U0126.

25172450|t|Establishment of the method for screening the potential targets and effective components of huatuo reconstruction pill.
25172450|a|Huatuo reconstruction pill (HTRP) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that mainly treats for hemiplegia and postoperation of brain stroke. Existing pharmacological studies have previously shown that HTRP could inhibit in vitro thrombosis, delay platelet adhesion, dilate blood vessels, and improve the microcirculation disturbances. In this paper, we chiefly concerned about the potential targets of HTRP and tried to figure out the active components of it. Computer-aided drug design method was emploied to search for the active components and explain the mechanism between the targets and the small molecules at molecular lever. The potential targets of this compound pharmaceutics were searched through relevant pharmacological studies and three pharmacophore models which involved the platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT2A) were constructed by Discotech method of Sybyl. Thus, the candidate compounds which agreed with the pharmacophore models were obtained by the virtual screening to the known ingredients of HTRP. Based on that, sequence and structure prediction of the unknown targets were realized by homology modeling which were used for molecular docking with those candidate compounds. Results showed that three compounds, which may prove to be valid to these targets, got higher scores than the existing corresponding inhibitors after molecular docking, including ferulic acid, onjixanthone I and albiflorin. And the three molecules may refer to the singificant substances to the total compounds of HTRP which were effective to the disease.

24722262|t|Analysis of central mechanism of cognitive training on cognitive impairment after stroke: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
24722262|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the central mechanism of cognitive training in patients with stroke, using resting state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: Patients with stroke and executive function and memory deficit were randomized to receive computer-assisted cognitive training (treatment group; total 60 h training over 10 weeks) or no training (control group). All participants received neuropsychological assessment and RS fMRI at baseline and 10 weeks. RESULTS: Patients in the treatment group (n = 16) showed increased functional connectivity (FC) of the hippocampus with the frontal lobe (right inferior, right middle, left middle, left inferior and left superior frontal gyrus) and left parietal lobe at 10 weeks compared with baseline. Patients in the control group (n = 18) showed decreased FC of the left hippocampus-right occipital gyrus, and right hippocampus-right posterior lobe of cerebellum and left superior temporal gyrus. Significant correlations were found between improved neuropsychological scores and increased FC of the hippocampus with the frontal lobe and left parietal lobe in the treatment group only. CONCLUSIONS: Increased RS FC of the hippocampus with the frontal and parietal lobes may be an important mechanism of cognitive recovery after stroke.

24562591|t|Herbal medicines for ischemic stroke: combating inflammation as therapeutic targets.
24562591|a|Stroke is a debilitating disease for which limited therapeutic approaches are available currently. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing novel therapies for stroke. Astrocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes constitute a neurovascular network for metabolic requirement of neurons. During ischemic stroke, these cells contribute to post-ischemic inflammation at multiple stages of ischemic cascades. Upon ischemia onset, activated resident microglia and astrocytes, and infiltrated immune cells release multiple inflammation factors including cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, free radicals and other small molecules, not only inducing brain damage but affecting brain repair. Recent progress indicates that anti-inflammation is an important therapeutic strategy for stroke. Given a long history with direct experience in the treatment of human subjects, Traditional Chinese Medicine and its related natural compounds are recognized as important sources for drug discovery. Last decade, a great progress has been made to identify active compounds from herbal medicines with the properties of modulating post-ischemic inflammation for neuroprotection. Herein, we discuss the inflammatory pathway in early stage and secondary response to injured tissues after stroke from initial artery occlusion to brain repair, and review the active ingredients from natural products with anti-inflammation and neuroprotection effects as therapeutic agents for ischemic stroke. Further studies on the post-ischemic inflammatory mechanisms and corresponding drug candidates from herbal medicine may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies in stroke treatment.

25722868|t|Can minimally invasive puncture and drainage for hypertensive spontaneous Basal Ganglia intracerebral hemorrhage improve patient outcome: a prospective non-randomized comparative study.
25722868|a|BACKGROUND: The treatment of hypertensive spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is still controversial. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether minimally invasive puncture and drainage (MIPD) could improve patient outcome compared with decompressive craniectomy (DC). METHODS: Consecutive patients with ICH (≧30 mL in basal ganglia within 24 hours of ictus) were non-randomly assigned to receive MIPD (group A) or DC (group B) hematoma evacuation. The primary outcome was death at 30 days after onset. Functional independence was assessed at 1 year using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. RESULTS: A total of 198 patients met the per protocol analysis (84 in group A and 114 in group B). The initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 8.1 ± 3.4 and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 20.8 ± 5.3. The mean hematoma volume (HV) was 56.7 ± 23.0 mL, and there was extended intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in 134 patients. There were no significant intergroup differences in the above baseline data, except group A had a higher mean age than that of group B (59.4 ± 14.5 vs. 55.3 ± 11.1 years, P = 0.025). The cumulative mortalities at 30 days and 1 year were 32.3% and 43.4%, respectively, and there were no significant differences between groups A and B. However, the mortality for patients ≦60 years, NIHSS < 15 or HV≦60 mL was significantly lower in group A than that in group B (all P < 0.05). The cumulative functional independence at 1 year was 26.8%, and the difference between group A (33/84, 39.3%) and group B (20/114, 17.5%) was significant (P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a favorable outcome after 1 year was associated with the difference in therapies, age, GCS, HV, IVH and pulmonary infection (all P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with hypertensive spontaneous ICH (HV≧30 mL in basal ganglia), MIPD may be a more effective treatment than DC, as assessed by a higher rate of functional independence at 1 year after onset as well as reduced mortality in patients ≦60 years of age, NIHSS < 15 or HV≦60 mL.

24963614|t|Neuroprotective effects of total steroid saponins on cerebral ischemia injuries in an animal model of focal ischemia/reperfusion.
24963614|a|Total steroid saponins isolated from Dioscorea zingiberensis are a unique traditional Chinese medicine known for its potential usage in various types of diseases. However, there is little evidence about its neuroprotective effect in transient focal ischemia-reperfusion cerebral injury. Therefore, the current study was carried out to investigate the effect of total steroid saponins on neuroprotection and its potential mechanisms in the rat ischemia-reperfusion model by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 min. The rats were each treated with total steroid saponins (30 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 3 mg/kg) or nimodipine (20 mg/kg) daily for 6 days before middle cerebral artery occlusion. Then, the neurological deficit score, cerebral infarct volume, and brain water content were measured at 24 h after reperfusion. Meanwhile, the histopathological changes and AQP-4 protein activities were examined in hippocampal CA1 and the cortex of ipsilateral ischemic cerebral hemisphere by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The indices of oxidative stress in the serum were also obtained, and NF-κB and ERK 1/2 protein expressions in the injured brain were evaluated by Western blotting. The results indicated that the pre-treatment with these drugs not only significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume, brain water content and improved neurological deficit score, but also restored neuronal morphology and decreased the AQP-4 positive cells in CA1 and the cortex. Moreover, it markedly restored the level of oxidant stress markers (CAT, SOD, MDA, NO and iNOS) to their normal range in serum. In addition, the increased NF-κB and ERK 1/2 protein expressions were alleviated as compared with the ischemia-reperfusion group. These findings demonstrate that total steroid saponins exhibit promising neuroprotection effects against the transient focal ischemia-reperfusion cerebral injury in the rat experimental model and the underlying mechanisms might be mediated through inhibition of anti-edema as well as anti-oxidative effects by inactivation of NF-κB and ERK 1/2 signalling pathway.

25112082|t|[Stroke-induced acroparalysis treated with xunjingcuiqi needling technique: a randomized controlled trial].
25112082|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the impacts on the muscle strength in the patients of stroke-induced acroparalysis treated with Xunjingcuiqi needling technique. METHODS: One hundred patients were randomized into a Xunjingcuiqi group and a routine acupuncture group, 50 cases in each group. In the routine acupuncture group, the routine acupuncture technique was adopted at the main acupoints, such as Shangxing (GV 23), Baihui (GV 20), Dicang (ST 4), Quchi (LI 11), Huantiao (GB 30) and Zusanli (ST 36), etc. In Xunjingcuiqi group, on the basis of the routine acupuncture technique, Xunjingcuiqi needling technique (pricking technique was quickly applied with the filiform needle along the running course of meridian to promote the conduction of meridian qi) was added. For the patients being hard to feel the needling sensation and with the muscle strength of 0 to 1 degree, Dongzhencuiqi technique was supplemented at shu-stream points of yang meridians (after qi arrival, the needling manipulation with limb movement was given to promote the conduction of meridian qi). The treatment was given once every day in the two groups. Ten treatments made one session. Three sessions of treatment were required. At the end of each session treatment, the muscle strength and clinical efficacy were assessed. RESULTS: In the 1st, 2nd and 3rd sessions of treatment, 20, 24 and 36 cases achieved the 3 to 5 degrees muscle strength in Xunjingcuiqi group, respectively; and 6, 10 and 15 cases achieved the 3 to 5 degrees muscle strength in the routine acupuncture group. The differences were significant statistically in comparison of the two groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The markably effective rates were 60.0% (30/50), 64.0% (32/50) and 70.0% (35/50) after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd sessions of treatment in Xunjingcuiqi group, respectively; and those were 38.0% (19/50), 44.0% (22/50) and 46.0% (23/50) in the routine acupuncture group, respectively. The differences were significant in the 1st and 3rd sessions of treatment between the two groups (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Xunjingcuiqi needling technique combined with routine acupuncture achieves the apparent superior efficacy on acroparalysis induced by ischemic stroke as compared with the simple routine acupuncture. Xunjingcuiqi needling technique obviously improves muscle strength and shortens the duration of sickness.

24690773|t|An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan protects against cerebral ischemia induced apoptosis in rats: up-regulation of Bcl-2 and down-regulation of Bax and caspase-3.
24690773|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan (AGNH), a Chinese traditional medicine, has been used for treatment of cerebral diseases for centuries in China and other Asian countries, and is approved by the State Food and Drug Administration of China for the treatment of stroke. The aim of present study is to test the neuroprotective effects of AGNH on cerebral ischemia in rats and to explore the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 75 Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), and I/R plus 0.065 g/kg/d AGNH, 0.125 g/kg/d AGNH and 0.25 g/kg/d AGNH. Cerebral ischemia was induced by 1.5h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neurological functional deficits were evaluated according to Zea longa׳s score, cerebral infarct area was measured by tetrazolium staining. Cell injury and apoptosis were assessed by Nissl staining and DNA fragmentation assay. The expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Rats subjected to MCAO exhibited worsened neurological score, infarct area, cell damage and apoptosis. These were all attenuated by AGNH (0.125 and 0.25 g/kg/d). Moreover, AGNH reversed cerebral ischemia induced decreases in Bcl-2 expression and increases in Bax and caspase-3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AGNH exerts neuroprotective effects, and the neuroprotection is likely to relate to depressed Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 level, leading to inhibition of apoptotic cell death.

24631567|t|Combination of transcranial direct current stimulation and methylphenidate in subacute stroke.
24631567|a|Noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and methylphenidate (MP) are associated with motor recovery after stroke. Based on the potentially complementary mechanisms of these interventions, we examined whether there is an interactive effect between MP and tDCS. In this preliminary study, we randomized subacute stroke subjects to receive tDCS alone, MP alone or combination of tDCS and MP. A blinded rater measured safety, hand function, and cortical excitability before and after treatment. None of the treatments caused any major or severe adverse effects or induced significant differences in cortical excitability. Analysis of variance of gain score, as measured by Purdue pegboard test, showed a significant between-group difference (F(2,6)=12.167, p=0.008). Post hoc analysis showed that the combination treatment effected greater Purdue pegboard gain scores than tDCS alone (p=0.017) or MP alone (p=0.01). Our preliminary data with nine subjects shows an interesting dissociation between motor function improvement and lack of motor corticospinal plasticity changes as indexed by transcranial magnetic stimulation in subacute stroke subjects.

24828425|t|Effects of acupuncture at GV20 and ST36 on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2, aquaporin 4, and aquaporin 9 in rats subjected to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
24828425|a|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Ischemic stroke is characterized by high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), aquaporin (AQP) 4, and AQP9 are linked to permeabilization of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). BBB disruption, tissue inflammation, and MMP/AQP upregulation jointly provoke brain edema/swelling after CIRI, while acupuncture and electroacupuncture can alleviate CIRI symptoms. This study evaluated the hypothesis that acupuncture and electroacupuncture can similarly exert neuroprotective actions in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by modulating MMP2/AQP4/APQ9 expression and inflammatory cell infiltration. METHODS: Eighty 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham group S, MCAO model group M, acupuncture group A, electroacupuncture group EA, and edaravone group ED. The MCAO model was established by placement of a suture to block the middle carotid artery, and reperfusion was triggered by suture removal in all groups except group S. Acupuncture and electroacupuncture were administered at acupoints GV20 (governing vessel-20) and ST36 (stomach-36). Rats in groups A, EA, and ED received acupuncture, electroacupuncture, or edaravone, respectively, immediately after MCAO. Neurological function (assessed using the Modified Neurological Severity Score), infarct volume, MMP2/AQP4/AQP9 mRNA and protein expression, and inflammatory cell infiltration were all evaluated at 24 h post-reperfusion. RESULTS: Acupuncture and electroacupuncture significantly decreased infarct size and improved neurological function. Furthermore, target mRNA and protein levels and inflammatory cell infiltration were significantly reduced in groups A, EA, and ED vs. group M. However, MMP2/AQP levels and inflammatory cell infiltration were generally higher in groups A and EA than in group ED except MMP2 mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture and electroacupuncture at GV20 and ST36 both exercised neuroprotective actions in a rat model of MCAO, with no clear differences between groups A and EA. Therefore, acupuncture and electroacupuncture might find utility as adjunctive and complementary treatments to supplement conventional therapy for ischemic stroke.

24657444|t|Cerebral glucose transporter: the possible therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.
24657444|a|Hyperglycemia is considered to be associated with poor outcomes of ischemic stroke. However, it is controversial about the blood glucose-lowering therapy in patients with stroke. According to the current reports, hyperglycemia is an indicator of severe stroke and cannot increase cerebral glucose content but promotes further ischemia in brain. Consequently, cerebral glucose control is significant to maintain the energy homeostasis. Compared with blood glucose level, the cerebral glucose content, controlled by glucose transporters (GLUTs), is more directly and important to maintain the energy supply in brain, especially to the patients with ischemic stroke. Some active materials, such as Glucagon-like peptide-1, progesterone, tPA and N-acetylcysteine, have been found to ameliorate ischemic stroke by regulating GLUTs expression. Therefore, this review discusses the significance of cerebral glucose level and GLUTs. Additionally, cerebral GLUTs and their actions in ischemic stroke are detailed in order to promote research on GLUTs as a possible therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.

24614334|t|Autophagic effect of programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) after focal cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury in rats.
24614334|a|Former studies indicated that programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) protein could accelerate the process of apoptosis in response to some stimuli in various kinds of cells via the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate for the first time that protein level of PDCD5 are related to autophagic activity after focal ischemic brain injury in rats. One hundred and twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats (male) were randomly divided into the following groups: Sham operated, Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion/Reperfusion (MCAO), MCAO+Control siRNA and MCAO+PDCD5 siRNA. Outcome measurements include neurobehavioral outcomes, brain infarct volume, brain water content, BBB disruption, MRI and double fluorescence labeling. Western blot and histopathophysiological techniques were used to measure the expression of PDCD5 and some pro-autophagic proteins such as Beclin 1 and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. The study found that decreased PDCD5 expression via intracerebroventricular injection of PDCD5 siRNA significantly improved the neurobehavioral outcome, reduced the infarct ratio, cerebral edema and BBB disruption. These results were associated with decreased expression of Beclin 1 and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in the penumbra area. Rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, partially weakened the effect of PDCD5 siRNA. In conclusion, this study suggested that PDCD5 was a key regulator of autophagy that might play an important role following MCAO injury.

24733159|t|Shengmai (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) for heart failure.
24733159|a|BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a major public health problem worldwide. Shengmai, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has long been used as a complementary treatment for heart failure in China. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2012. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect (both benefits and harms) of Shengmai in treatment of people with heart failure. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library (Issue 5 of 12, April 2013); DARE on The Cochrane Library (Issue 2 of 4, April 2013); MEDLINE (1948 to June Week 1 2013); EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 23); AMED (1985 to August 2008); BIOSIS (1969 to 7 June 2013); CBM (1978 to June 2013); VIP (1989 to June 2013); and CNKI (1979 to June 2013). We also handsearched Chinese journals and did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of Shengmai plus usual treatment for heart failure versus usual treatment alone, or Shengmai versus placebo, irrespective of blinding status. In this update we only included studies with a clear description of randomisation methods and classified as true RCTs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We calculated dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed-effect model to perform meta-analysis for outcomes without heterogeneity; and a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis for outcomes with heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 14 RCTs (858 patients) in this review update, four of which were new trials. Of these 14 RCTs, 11 trials compared Shengmai plus usual treatment with usual treatment alone, and three trials compared Shengmai with placebo. Improvement of NYHA functional classification was more common in patients taking Shengmai plus usual treatment than in those receiving usual treatment alone (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.51; 10 trials, 672 participants; low quality evidence). Beneficial effects of Shengmai in treating heart failure were also observed in other outcomes, including exercise test, ejection fraction and cardiac output. The three RCTs (106 patients) comparing Shengmai with placebo reported improvement in NYHA functional classification and in stroke volume. Three of the 14 RCTs reported a total of six patients with mild adverse effects and two were withdrawn due to the adverse effects. The adverse events rate was 1.21%. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Shengmai may exert a positive effect on heart failure, especially for improving NYHA functional classification when Shengmai plus usual treatment is used. The review results should be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias of the included studies (particularly regarding allocation concealment and blinding), the small sample size of these studies, and the significant heterogeneity in outcomes such as ejection function, cardiac output and stroke volume. There was no evidence available concerning the effect of Shengmai on mortality, and more high quality studies with long-term follow-up are warranted.

24568774|t|Effects of Salvia miltiorrhiza on neural differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells.
24568774|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Salvia miltiorrhiza, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, is commonly used to treat some neurological diseases because of its anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. We investigate whether Salvia miltiorrhiza can improve the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into neurons in vitro, and promote iPSCs-derived neural stem cells survival, integrate, and differentiation after their transplantation to the ischemic brain tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Induced pluripotent stem cells were used to differentiate into neural stem cells, and further into neurons in induction medium with various concentrations of Salvia miltiorrhiza. The effects were assessed by immunofluorescence staining, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. iPSC-derived neural stem cells were transplanted into the brains of rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion, immunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate survival, integrate, and differentiation of grafted cells, the functional recovery of the animals was tested by the Longa scores and spontaneous motor activity. RESULTS: Salvia miltiorrhiza (5μg/ml) significantly increased the gene and protein expression of Nestin compared with that in other groups. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) expression in induction medium with 5μg/ml Salvia miltiorrhiza was significantly higher than that in the control group. After cells transplantation into the ischemic brain, more grafted MAP2(+) cells were found in Salvia miltiorrhiza-treated rats than others at 7 days. Salvia miltiorrhiza-treated rats showed the most remarkable functional recovery at 7 and 14 days. CONCLUSION: Salvia miltiorrhiza induces differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells to differentiate into neurons efficiently. The plant provides neuroprotection to implanted cells and improves functional recovery after their transplantation to the ischemic brain tissues.

24712684|t|Primary prevention for risk factors of ischemic stroke with Baduanjin exercise intervention in the community elder population: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
24712684|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is a major cause of death and disability in the world, and the prevalence of stroke tends to increase with age. Despite advances in acute care and secondary preventive strategies, primary prevention should play the most significant role in the reduction of the burden of stroke. As an important component of traditional Chinese Qigong, Baduanjin exercise is a simple, safe exercise, especially suitable for older adults. However, current evidence is insufficient to inform the use of Baduanjin exercise in the prevention of stroke.The aim of this trail is to systematically evaluate the prevention effect of Baduanjin exercise on ischemic stroke in the community elder population with high risk factors. METHODS: A total of 170 eligible participants from the community elder population will be randomly allocated into the Baduanjin exercise group and usual physical activity control group in a 1:1 ratio. Besides usual physical activity, participants in the Baduanjin exercise group will accept a 12-week Baduanjin exercise training with a frequency of five days a week and 40 minutes a day. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline, 13 weeks (at end of intervention) and 25 weeks (after additional 12-week follow-up period). DISCUSSION: This study will be the randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Baduanjin exercise for primary prevention of stroke in community elder population with high risk factors of stroke. The results of this trial will help to establish the optimal approach for primary prevention of stroke.

24719562|t|Amelioration of stroke-induced neurological deficiency by lyophilized powder of catapol and puerarin.
24719562|a|Catalpol and puerarin are active ingredients isolated from Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch and Radix Puerariae, respectively. They are popular in research for their poly-pharmacological effects. This research focused on effect of anti-stroke by lyophilized powder of catalpol and puerarin (C-P) and potential mechanisms. At the beginning of research, C-P was identified and analyzed by HPLC. Neurological function was evaluated by Longa score, neurological complex function score and beam balance score after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAO) in mice. Infarct volume and water content were evaluated after treatment of C-P. Anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis and neurogenesis were investigated by ELISA, WB and immunohistochemical stain respectively. With treatment of C-P, neurological deficiency of PMCAO mice was ameliorated. Morphologically, infarct volume and water content in ischemic hemisphere were significantly reduced by C-P. In vivo and in vitro, oxidative stress injury was extenuated by C-P. Meanwhile, Caspase-3 was down-regulated and Bxl-2 was up-regulated by C-P in vivo. In addition, C-P enhanced angiogenesis around the infarct of cortex and neurogenesis in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus (DG). Hence, C-P ameliorated stroke-induced neurological deficiency through its multiple neuroprotections. What's more, this article provides us a novel formula of active ingredients for stroke.

24702144|t|The effects of compound danshen dripping pills and human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell transplant after acute myocardial infarction.
24702144|a|OBJECTIVES: The low frequency of survival of stem cells implanted in the myocardium after acute myocardial infarction may be caused by inflammation and oxidative stress in the myocardial microenvironment. We evaluated the effects of a traditional Chinese medicine, Compound Danshen Dripping Pills, on the cardiac microenvironment and cardiac function when used alone or in combination with human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell transplant after acute myocardial infarction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After surgically induced acute myocardial infarction, rabbits were treated with Compound Danshen Dripping Pills alone or in combination with human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell transplant. Evaluation included histology, measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening, leukocyte count, count of green fluorescent protein positive cells, superoxide dismutase activity, and malondialdehyde content. RESULTS: Combination treatment with Compound Danshen Dripping Pills and human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell transplant significantly increased the survival of implanted cells, inhibited cardiac cell apoptosis, decreased oxidative stress, decreased the inflammatory response, and improved cardiac function. Rabbits treated with either Compound Danshen Dripping Pills or human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells alone had improvement in these effects compared with untreated control rabbits. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with Compound Danshen Dripping Pills and human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells may improve cardiac function and morphology after acute myocardial infarction.

24783923|t|Clinical efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine combined with Western Medicine in patients with diabetic acute ischemic stroke.
24783923|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) combined with Western Medicine (WM) in patients with diabetic acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Ninety patients with diabetic acute ischemic stroke were randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group. The 45 patients in the treatment group were given standardized treatment with TCM combined with WM. They received corresponding oral Chinese decoctions three times daily, according to their TCM syndromes, along with basic western medical treatment. The 45 patients in the control group were given non-standardized treatment with TCM combined with WM. They received an oral Chinese decoction for promotion of blood circulation to inhibit hemostasis, regardless of their TCM syndromes, along with basic western medical treatment. The treatments lasted for 4 weeks. Scores were evaluated on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, activity of daily life (ADL) scores, and TCM symptoms before treatment and 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Analysis of variance for repeated measurements showed that there were significant differences in NIHSS and ADL score before and after treatment in both groups (P < 0.05). There were also significant differences between the scores at 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. There were significant differences in TCM syndrome scores before and after treatment in both groups (P < 0.05). There were also significant differences between the scores at 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. The X2 test showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Standardized treatment was superior to non-standardized treatment for clinical efficacy of TCM combined with WM in patients with diabetic acute ischemic stroke, and the superiority was more obvious in improving neural dysfunction, ADL score, and TCM symptoms. The adverse reactions were similar in the two treatment groups.

24567111|t|Astragalosides attenuate learning and memory impairment in rats following ischemia‑reperfusion injury.
24567111|a|Astragalosides (ASTs) have been traditionally used in the treatment of various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of AST on learning and memory following focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in a rat model. A Morris water maze was used to measure the effect of AST on learning and memory impairments. A histological examination and Hoechst 33258 staining was used to observe the neuronal changes and apoptosis in the hippocampus. The activity of phospho-extracellular signal‑regulated kinases (p‑ERK), p‑c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p‑Akt was measured by western blotting. The data revealed that AST improved the rats learning and memory abilities, attenuated neuronal cells apoptosis, increased the expression of p‑ERK and p‑Akt, and decreased the expression of p‑JNK. These findings indicated that AST has protective effects that may be correlated with the inhibition of neuronal cell apoptosis and the regulation of p‑ERK, p‑Akt and p‑JNK expression.

25206889|t|Early filiform needle acupuncture for poststroke depression: a meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled clinical trials.
25206889|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of filiform needle acupuncture for poststroke depression, and to compare acupuncture with the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressant drugs. DATA RETRIEVAL: We retrieved data from the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (1979-2012), Wanfang (1980-2012), VIP (1989-2012), Chinese Biomedical Literature (1975-2012), PubMed (1966-2012), Ovid Lww (-2012), and Cochrane Library (-2012) Database using the internet. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials on filiform needle acupuncture versus antidepressant drugs for treatment of poststroke depression were included. Moreover, the included articles scored at least 4 points on the Jadad scale. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: other acupuncture therapies as treatment group, not stroke-induced depression patients, score < 4 points, non-randomized controlled trials, or animal trials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: These were the Hamilton Depression Scale scores, clinical effective rate, Self-Rating Depression Scale scores, Side Effect Rating Scale scores, and incidence of adverse reaction and events. RESULTS: A total of 17 randomized controlled clinical trials were included. Meta-analysis results displayed that after 4 weeks of treatment, clinical effective rate was better in patients treated with filiform needle acupuncture than those treated with simple antidepressant drugs [relative risk = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.21, P = 0.01]. At 6 weeks, clinical effective rate was similar between filiform needle acupuncture and antidepressant drug groups. At 2 weeks after filiform needle acupuncture, Hamilton Depression Scale (17 items) scores were lower than in the antidepressant drug group (mean difference = -2.34, 95%CI: -3.46 to -1.22, P < 0.000,1). At 4 weeks, Hamilton Depression Scale (24 items) scores were similar between filiform needle acupuncture and antidepressant drug groups. Self-Rating Depression Scale scores were lower in filiform needle acupuncture group than in the antidepressant drug group. Side Effect Rating Scale was used in only two articles, and no meta-analysis was conducted. Safety evaluation of the 17 articles showed that gastrointestinal tract reactions such as nausea and vomiting were very common in the antidepressant drug group. Incidence of adverse reaction and events was very low in the filiform needle acupuncture group. CONCLUSION: Early filiform needle acupuncture for poststroke depression can perfectly control depression. Filiform needle acupuncture is safe and reliable. Therapeutic effects of filiform needle acupuncture were better than those of antidepressant drugs.

24739411|t|Unusual heat stroke caused by herbal therapy with traditional Chinese medicine.
24739411|a|Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) comprises a range of traditional medical practices that originate in China, including herbal medicine as a major therapy. Through its 4 natures; namely, cold, hot, warm, and cool, herbal medicine may regulate sympathetic nerves and basal metabolic rate and affect the CNS and the endocrine system. Heat stroke is a severely life-threatening heat-related illness that is most commonly seen during summer heat waves and high environmental temperatures. The intake of medications or toxins is considered one of the risk factors leading to heat stroke, as they may affect body thermoregulation. We report a case of heat stroke that was associated with herbal therapy with TCM. This case highlights the importance of paying more attention to unidentified folk prescriptions in the use of TCM.

24812892|t|[Changes of left ventricular remodeling in hypertension patients with carotid atherosclerosis of phlegm-dampness syndrome].
24812892|a|OBJECTIVE: To study changes of left ventricular remodeling (LVR) in hypertension patients with carotid atherosclerosis (CAS) of phlegm-dampness syndrome (PDS). METHODS: Doppler ultrasonography data of CAS were observed in 223 hypertension patients with CAS (as the hypertension group, including 119 patients of the PDS group and 104 of the non-PDS group), 81 CAS patients with non-hypertension, and 19 non-hypertension non-CAS patients (as the control group). The difference in the degree of LVR was compared among the above groups. RESULTS: The left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT), inter ventricular septum thickness (IVS), E/A were higher in the hypertension group than in the non-hypertension group (P < 0.05). The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), stroke volume (SV) were higher in the soft plaque hypertension group and the soft plaque non-hypertension group than in the hard plaque group, the thickening intimal group, and the normal intimal group (P < 0.01 , P < 0.05). The LVEDD, LVESD, and SV were higher, and the ejection fraction (EF) was lower in the PDS hypertension group than in the non-PDS hypertension group (all P < 0.05). Of them, LVEDD, LVESD, and SV were higher in the soft plaque group than in the hard plaque group (P < 0.01), the thickening intimal group (P < 0.01) and the normal intimal group (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in PDS hypertension between the soft plaque group and the hard plaque group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The hypertension patients with CAS of PDS might be correlated to LVR, and LVR was more obviously in the soft plaque patients.

24556145|t|Structure-activity relationship of Baifuzi-cerebrosides on BKCa channel activation.
24556145|a|Our previous study reported that a mixture of cerebrosides from traditional Chinese medicine Baifuzi could activate BKCa channel. It is curious to know the effect of each single cerebroside on the channel. Here we isolated 5 pure cerebrosides from the mixture and determined their chemical structures. The most potent one increased the single channel open probability 6 folds with EC50 value of 1.0 μM. The structure-activity relationship revealed that acyl chain length of cerebrosides has potent effect, while configuration of double bond at C8-C9 on their long chain base has weak effect on the channel activity. Thus, this research provides a guide for design and synthesis of a lead cerebroside with more potent effect on the BKCa channel.

24412553|t|The effect of stroke and other components in Xing-Nao-Jing on the pharmacokinetics of geniposide.
24412553|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Geniposide is a bioactive substance derived from gardenia, which has been used in traditional Chinese preparation, such as "Xing-Nao-Jing" (XNJ) for stroke treatment. Stroke and the ingredients of herbal preparation affect the pharmacokinetics of geniposide. A comparative pharmacokinetic study of geniposide in stroke and sham-operated rats after administration of XNJ and geniposide was proceeded to evaluate the effect of stroke on pharmacokinetics of geniposide, while the influence of other components in XNJ was determined by using gardenia extract and geniposide-borneol compounds in rats with stroke to compare. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion 2h later. Plasma concentration of geniposide was determined by HPLC. Various pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from the plasma concentration versus time data using non-compartmental methods. RESULTS: The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC0-t) in stroke after administration of XNJ were 5.97±3.82 μg/mL, and 570.06±274.32 μg·min/mL, respectively, which were 5 times compared with sham-operated rats or the stroke-afflicted rats given geniposide. In stroke, the Cmax and AUC(0-t) of geniposide-borneol group and gardenia extraction group were close to XNJ group and geniposide group, respectively. The geniposide-borneol group had a higher value. CONCLUSION: Stroke improved the absorption of geniposide in XNJ. Borneol may be the key ingredient in XNJ improving the absorption of geniposide.

24741185|t|Effects of delayed puerarin treatment in long-term neurological outcomes of focal ischemic stroke in rats.
24741185|a|OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at investigate the therapeutic effects of delayed puerarin treatment in neurological outcomes after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to MCAO for 120 min followed by reperfusion for 14 days. Puerarin (0, 50, 100, 200 mg/kg, intra-peritoneally) was administered at 24 h after stroke onset and repeated daily for 14 days. Neurological deficits were evaluated at 1, 4, 7, 14 days after stroke. Brain infarct volume and peri-infarct context vessel density were examined at 14 days after stroke. RESULTS: Puerarin significantly improved neurological functions up to 14 days after stroke and decreased the infarct volume with doses of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg compared with saline controls. Puerarin treatment also significantly increased peri-infarct context vessel density at 14 days after stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed treatment of puerarin initiated at 24 h after stroke is beneficial with improved long-term neurological outcomes and reduced infarction volume in focal ischemic stroke in rats. Enhanced vascular remodeling by puerarin might at least partially contribute to its beneficial effects.

24378639|t|Neuroprotective effects of Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction against glutamate-induced apoptosis in BV-2 cells.
24378639|a|Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction (GLGZD), a traditional Chinese medicine consisting of different herbal medicines, has been used for centuries in the treatment of muscular spasticity following stroke, epilepsy or spinal cord injury. However, the precise mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of GLGZD on glutamate-induced apoptosis in cultured BV-2 cells, as well as the underlying mechanisms. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was applied to assess the viability of the cells. An Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) assay was utilized to analyze cellular apoptosis. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was evaluated by flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The gene and protein expression of the apoptosis-related genes, Bcl-2 and Bax, was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of cleaved caspase-3 protein was detected by immunofluorescence. Glutamate treatment induced the loss of BV-2 cell viability, which was associated with an increase in the apoptotic rate, as well as an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the extracellular levels of cleaved caspase-3. Treatment with GLGZD significantly reversed these phenotypes, with its maximum protective effects observed at the concentration of 1,000 µg/ml. These results indicate that GLGZD protects BV-2 cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. These protective effects may be ascribed to its anti-apoptotic activities, in part, associated with the decrease in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 expression, as well as with the stability of high mitochondrial membrane potential.

23388703|t|Stroke prevention knowledge and prestroke health behaviors among hypertensive stroke patients in mainland China.
23388703|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Individuals with hypertension are at risk of stroke, and patients with stroke histories are at risk of experiencing another stroke. At this time, however, only a few studies have reported on stroke prevention knowledge and health behaviors among hypertensive patients who have had an initial stroke. The purpose of this study was to determine stroke prevention knowledge and health behaviors and to analyze the association between these 2 variables among hypertensive stroke patients who have had an initial stroke. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: With the use of a descriptive correlational design, a sample of 112 hypertensive stroke patients was recruited from the departments of neurology of 3 hospitals in Guangzhou, China. Each patient completed 2 reliable, validated questionnaires, the Stroke Prevention Knowledge Questionnaire and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II. Data were collected during patients' hospital admission for stroke, within 2 days of stroke onset, and before they received stroke education. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to examine the correlations between the study variables. Multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to predict both the level of knowledge relating to stroke prevention and health behaviors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The participants showed a relatively low level of stroke prevention knowledge and a moderate level of engagement in healthy behaviors. Pearson correlation coefficient between these 2 variables was 0.423 (P < .001). The results of multiple regression analysis showed that stroke prevention knowledge was positively influenced by education level; health behaviors were positively influenced by both gender and stroke prevention knowledge. Findings suggest that male hypertensive patients and those with a lower education level need targeted stroke education. Because knowledge was unrelated to behavior with respect to smoking, alcohol use, and low-salt diet, behavioral interventions should be explored to address these important risk factors among patients at risk for stroke.

24231135|t|Effect of low-intensity ergometer aerobic training on glucose tolerance in severely impaired nondiabetic stroke patients.
24231135|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether low-intensity ergometer aerobic training has beneficial effect on glucose tolerance in nondiabetic patients with severely impaired stroke. METHODS: Fifty-four severely impaired stroke survivors were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group and control group. They have no diabetes history with fasting plasma glucose less than 7 mmol/L. Both groups participated in a 6-week rehabilitation training program with low-intensity ergometer aerobic training added only in the experimental group 3 times per week. Primary outcome variables were fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 2-hour glucose, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in oral glucose tolerance test before and after intervention. RESULTS: Before intervention, 36 of 54 (66.7%) were diagnosed with impaired glucose status or diabetic glucose tolerance totally. The average 2-hour plasma glucose level was 9.14 ± 1.39 mmol/L. After intervention, aerobic training significantly improved fasting insulin (from 8.51 ± 2.01 μU/mL to 7.11 ± 2.02 μU/mL), 2-hour glucose level (from 9.13 ± 1.14 mmol/L to 7.22 ± 1.23 mmol/L), and HOMA-IR (from 1.62 ± 1.01 to 1.29 ± .79) in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < .05). Aerobic training also significantly improved their glucose tolerance state (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings suggest that abnormal glucose tolerance may be highly present among severely impaired nondiabetic stroke patients and low-intensity ergometer aerobic training may have beneficial role in improving glucose tolerance.

24599691|t|Buyang Huanwu decoction increases angiopoietin-1 expression and promotes angiogenesis and functional outcome after focal cerebral ischemia.
24599691|a|Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese herbal prescription, has been widely used clinically to treat stroke in China for hundreds of years; however, the mechanisms of this drug for stroke treatment are still unclear. This study aims to observe the cerebral angiogenesis effects of BYHWD on chronic brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia in rats and to explore its possible mechanisms. The ischemia was induced by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 90 min. BYHWD (12.5 and 25.0 g/(kg ∙ d), equivalent to the dry weight of the raw materials) was orally administered twice a day beginning 2 h after surgery. BYHWD significantly attenuated the neurological dysfunction, infarct volume, and brain atrophy after ischemia. There was a significant increase in the microvessel density, as assessed by immunofluorescence CD31, and a significant increase in angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in the penumbra areas of the rats was shown by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. The results indicate that the neurorestorative effects of BYHWD are associated with angiogenesis and the enhancement of the expressions of Ang-1 on chronic brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia.

24481975|t|Prevalence and outcomes of symptomatic intracranial large artery stenoses and occlusions in China: the Chinese Intracranial Atherosclerosis (CICAS) Study.
24481975|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to establish the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) in China by a large, prospective, multicenter study. METHODS: We evaluated 2864 consecutive patients who experienced an acute cerebral ischemia<7 days after symptom onset in 22 Chinese hospitals. All patients underwent magnetic resonance angiography, with measurement of diameter of the main intracranial arteries. ICAS was defined as ≥50% diameter reduction on magnetic resonance angiography. RESULTS: The prevalence of ICAS was 46.6% (1335 patients, including 261 patients with coexisting extracranial carotid stenosis). Patients with ICAS had more severe stroke at admission and stayed longer in hospitals compared with those without intracranial stenosis (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 3 versus 5; median length of stay, 14 versus 16 days; both P<0.0001). After 12 months, recurrent stroke occurred in 3.27% of patients with no stenosis, in 3.82% for those with 50% to 69% stenosis, in 5.16% for those with 70% to 99% stenosis, and in 7.27% for those with total occlusion. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed that the degree of arterial stenosis, age, family history of stroke, history of cerebral ischemia or heart disease, complete circle of Willis, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission were independent predictors for recurrent stroke at 1 year. The highest rate of recurrence was observed in patients with occlusion with the presence of ≥3 additional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: ICAS is the most common vascular lesion in patients with cerebrovascular disease in China. Recurrent stroke rate in our study was lower compared with those of previous clinical trials but remains unacceptably high in a subgroup of patients with severe stenosis.

24843962|t|[Impact on the gait time cycle of ischemic stroke in the treatment with yin-yang respiratory reinforcing and reducing needling technique].
24843962|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in the efficacy on gait time cycle of ischemic stroke between yin-yang respiratory reinforcing and reducing needling technique (yin-yang needling) and the conventional acupuncture. METHODS: Sixty cases of ischemic stroke were randomized into a conventional acupuncture group and a yin-yang needling group, 30 cases in each one. The basic treatment (the control of blood pressure, blood sugar and blood lipid, the intravenous drops of ginkgo leaf extract and dipyridamole injection and vinpocetine injection) were applied in the two groups. Additionally, in the conventional acupuncture group, the acupoints of the Stomach Meridian of Foot-Yangming [Biguan (ST 31), Liangqiu (ST 34), Zusanli (ST 36), Shangjuxu (ST 37), Xiajuxu (ST 39), etc.] were selected and stimulated with the even needling technique. In the yin-yang needling group, the acupoints of yin meridians such as Zuwuli (LR 10), Xuehai (SP 10), Yinlingquan (SP 9) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6), etc. and the acupoints of yang meridians such as Biguan (ST 31), Liangqiu (ST 34) and Yanglingquan (GB 34), etc. were selected. The reducing manipulation of respiratory reinforcing and reducing technique was applied to the acupoints of yin meridians and the reinforcing manipulation was applied to the acupoints of yang meridians. The kinematics time parameters were determined and compared before and 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, the differences in the gait cycle, the phase time of standing (%), the phase time of single support (%), the phase time of unilateral sway (%) on the affected (healthy) foot and phase time of double support (%) were significant as compared with those before treatment in the patients of the two groups (all P < 0.05), in which, the gait cycle (1.75 +/- 0.21 vs 2.02 +/- 0.37), the phase time of standing (%) on the affected (healthy) foot [(65.41 +/- 5.20)% vs (68.37 +/- 6.24)%, (70.99 +/- 6.47)% vs (74.51 +/- 5.19)%], the phase time of unilateral sway (%) on the affected (healthy) foot [(36.08 +/- 4.86)% vs (33.65 +/- 2.94)%, (31.04 +/- 3.41)% vs (26.77 +/- 2.67)%] and the phase time of double support (%) [(36.91 +/- 5.10)% vs (41.22 +/- 5.39)%] in the yin-yang needling group were improved much obviously after treatment as compared with those in the conventional acupuncture group. The differences in support phase time (%), single support phase time (%) and sway phase time (%) were significant between the affected limb and healthy limb of the two groups after treatment (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Yin-yang respiratory reinforcing and reducing needling technique effectively improves hemiplegic gait movement cycle and walking function in patients of ischemic stroke, which is superior to the conventional acupuncture treatment.

25204193|t|[Chinese classical formulas for treatment of essential hypertension].
25204193|a|Essential hypertension is one of the most prevalent and important public health concerns in both westernized and developing countries. Recent studies have demonstrated that successful long-term treatment of hypertension has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and stroke. Chinese classical formulas, which are important components of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), have been increasingly accepted by patients with CVDs worldwide. According to TCM theory and syndrome differentiation, hypertension could be categorized into 3 patterns including fire syndrome, fluid retention syndrome, and deficiency syndrome. Chinese classical formulas, including Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli tang, Tianma Gouteng yin, Zhen Gan Xifeng tang, Banxia Baizhu Tianma tang, Liu Wei Dihuang wan, etc, play an important role in the treatment of essential hypertension, which could be further research priorities.

25204161|a|Stroke is one of the major diseases that threaten human health, early diagnosis and treatment are very important for stroke. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is measured noninvasively to diagnosis stroke, and it is a independent predictor for stroke because its thickening can timely predict the incidence and development of stroke. As an important predictor of cardiovascular disease, more and more attention is played on CIMT. In this review, we will make a summary on the important role of CIMT in stroke and the mechanisms of carotid intima-media thickening in stroke as well as the potential use of traditional Chinese medicine in treating carotid intima-media thickening.

24520334|t|Oriental medicine Kyung-Ok-Ko prevents and alleviates dehydroepiandrosterone-induced polycystic ovarian syndrome in rats.
24520334|a|Kyung-Ok-Ko (KOK), a traditional herbal prescription composed of Rehmannia glutinosa Liboschitz var. purpurae, Lycium chinense, Aquillaria agallocha, Poria cocos, Panax ginseng, and honey, has been widely used in traditional Oriental medicine as a vitalizing medicine or as the prescription for patients with age-associated disorders such as amnesia and stroke. However, the potential protective value of KOK for the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is largely unknown. We investigated whether pre-administration (daily from 2 hours before PCOS induction) and post-administration (daily after induction of PCOS) of KOK (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg/day, p.o.) could have a protective effect in a dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA, s.c.)-induced PCOS rat model. Pre-administration of KOK significantly decreased the elevated body weight and ovary weight, elevated size and number of follicular cysts, elevated level of serum glucose, and estradiol after DHEA injection. KOK reduced the elevated percentage of CD8 (+) T lymphocytes in lymph nodes, the elevated mRNA expression of CD11b and CD3 in ovaries, and infiltration of macrophages in ovarian tissue with PCOS. KOK diminished the increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1), and iNOS in the ovaries, and increased the reduced mRNA expression of growth factors (EGF, TGF-β) by DHEA injection. Post-administration of KOK also improved the DHEA-induced PCOS-like symptoms, generally similar to those evident from pre-administration of KOK. KOK may effectively prevent and improve DHEA-induced PCOS via anti-inflammatory action, indicating its preventive and therapeutic potential for suppressing PCOS.

24496233|t|A systematic review and meta-analysis of Baihui (GV20)-based scalp acupuncture in experimental ischemic stroke.
24496233|a|Acupuncture for stroke has been used in China for over 2,000 years and nowadays is increasingly practiced elsewhere in the world. However, previous studies had conflicting findings on the results of acupuncture. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the current evidence for the effect of Baihui (GV20)-based scalp acupuncture in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia. Six databases from the inception of each database up to June 2013 were electronically searched. Primary outcomes were infarct size and neurobehavioral outcome. Ultimately, 54 studies involving 1816 animals were identified describing procedures. Meta-analysis results showed that twelve studies reported significant effects of Baihui (GV20)-based scalp acupuncture for improving infarct volume compared with middle cerebral artery occlusion group (P < 0.01), and thirty-two studies reported significant effects of Baihui (GV20)-based scalp acupuncture for improving the neurological function score when compared with the control group (P < 0.01). In conclusion, Baihui (GV20)-based scalp acupuncture could improve infarct volume and neurological function score and exert potential neuroprotective role in experimental ischemic stroke.

24502632|t|Comparative analysis of the neuroprotective effects of ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 extracted from Panax notoginseng against cerebral ischemia.
24502632|a|Panax notoginseng, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for thousands of years to treat ischemic patients. More than 20 saponin components have been isolated from P. notoginseng root and identified chemically. However, these different chemical components have different roles. In this study we compared the neuroprotective mechanisms of ginsenosides Rg1, Rb1, Rg1/Rb1, and panax notoginsenoside (PNS) against injuries caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Our results show that all of these treatments significantly reduced infarction volume and alleviated neurological deficits caused by cerebral I/R. The increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was inhibited by these treatments in the hippocampus. The decreased expressions of thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD-1), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) caused by cerebral I/R were restored by these treatments. The expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was enhanced in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, as well as in all of the treatment groups. These results suggest that Rg1 and Rb1 have similar roles in protecting the brain from ischemic damage; however, neither Rg1/Rb1 nor PNS have synergistic effects, thus either Rg1 or the Rb1 monomer should be considered as a pharmacological neuroprotective strategy for use in the case of ischemic stroke.

24619238|t|Study on acupuncture parameters impacting on the acupuncture effect using cluster analysis in a rat model with middle cerebral artery occlusion.
24619238|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of acupuncture parameters on the acupuncture effect through the cluster analysis in Wistar rat model with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: Duplicated MCAO models by Zea-longa's thread ligation and chose rats with 1-3 scores assessed by Zausinger's six-score method to be grouped. The rats were divided into 6 basic control groups [(including a normal group, a sham group, a model control group, a model group without intervention, a Nimodipine group, a lateral-to-Renzhong (DU6) group] and 6 acupuncture groups [a Neiguan (PC6) group, a Weizhong (BL40) group, a Sanyinjiao (SP6) group, a Chize (LU5) group, a Renzhong (DU6) group and a Feixue (non-acupoint) group]. In the acupuncture groups, for every acupoint or needling site, 9 different parameters [2 factors (frequency and time) and 3 levels (180, 120, and 60 cpm of the frequency and 5, 60, and 180 s of the time)] were set respectively by the orthogonal intersection method, in total 54 groups. The rats were treated by acupuncture with a lifting-thrusting manipulation once every 12 h, in total 6 times. Neurobehavioral scores, cerebral blood flow, infarction rate, microcirculation, light microscopy, etc. were measured. The factor analysis was first applied to get the comprehensive effect scores of the samples in the acupuncture groups and then by which the cluster analysis was made with the statistical software of SPSS17.0. RESULTS: For the Neiguan (PC6) group, the exceptional results of acupuncture comprehensive effect were parameters 7, 8, 9, 10; the valid results were parameters 2, 3, 4, and the invalid were parameters 5, 6. For the Weizhong (BL40) group, the exceptional results were parameters 2, 4; the valid results were parameters 3, 5, 6, 7, and the invalid were parameters 8, 9, 10. For the Chize (LU5) group, the exceptional results were parameters 7, 8; the valid results were parameters 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10; and the invalid was parameter 2. For the Sanyinjiao (SP6) group, the exceptional results were parameters 4, 6; the valid results were parameters 2, 3, 5; and the invalid were parameters 7, 8, 9,10. For the Renzhong (DU6) group, the exceptional results were parameters 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10; the valid results were parameters 2, 5; and the invalid was parameter 8. For the Non-acupoint group, the exceptional result was parameter 10; the valid results were parameters 2, 3, 4, 7, 9; and the invalid were parameters 5, 6, 8. CONCLUSIONS: For each meridian acupoint, different acupuncture parameters could consequently get a different acupuncture effect; each meridian acupoint had the most suitable or optimal acupuncture parameters; acupuncture parameters might be the main factors impacting on acupuncture effect.

25206815|t|Acupuncture at Waiguan (SJ5) and sham points influences activation of functional brain areas of ischemic stroke patients: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
25206815|a|Most studies addressing the specificity of meridians and acupuncture points have focused mainly on the different neural effects of acupuncture at different points in healthy individuals. This study examined the effects of acupuncture on brain function in a pathological context. Sixteen patients with ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to true point group (true acupuncture at right Waiguan (SJ5)) and sham point group (sham acupuncture). Results of functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed activation in right parietal lobe (Brodmann areas 7 and 19), the right temporal lobe (Brodmann area 39), the right limbic lobe (Brodmann area 23) and bilateral occipital lobes (Brodmann area 18). Furthermore, inhibition of bilateral frontal lobes (Brodmann area 4, 6, and 45), right parietal lobe (Brodmann areas 1 and 5) and left temporal lobe (Brodmann area 21) were observed in the true point group. Activation in the precuneus of right parietal lobe (Brodmann area 7) and inhibition of the left superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 10) was observed in the sham group. Compared with sham acupuncture, acupuncture at Waiguan in stroke patients inhibited Brodmann area 5 on the healthy side. Results indicated that the altered specificity of sensation-associated cortex (Brodmann area 5) is possibly associated with a central mechanism of acupuncture at Waiguan for stroke patients.

24672935|t|[Effect of blood activating water relieving method on heart functions and serum levels of NT-proBNP in patients with heart failure with normal ejection fraction].
24672935|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of blood activating water relieving method (BAWRM) on heart functions and serum levels of NT-proBNP in patients with heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF). METHODS: Sixty-four HFNEF patients were admitted to our hospital during January 2011 to June 2012. They were randomly assigned to the treatment group (32 cases) and the control group (32 cases). Patients in the control group received routine Western medical treatment, while those in the treatment group additionally took Chinese medical recipes for activating blood circulation and relieving water retention. Changes of Chinese medical syndromes, E/E', serum NT-proBNP contents were observed between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, their Chinese medical syndromes and E/E' were significantly improved, and serum NT-proBNP contents decreased in the two groups (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, Chinese medical syndromes, E/E', serum NT-proBNP contents obviously decreased in the treatment group, showing statistical difference (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: BAWRM was an effective way to improve the diastolic function of HFNEF patients and lower the serum level of NT-proBNP with confirmative efficacy.

24475108|t|Favorable circulatory system outcomes as adjuvant traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment for cerebrovascular diseases in Taiwan.
24475108|a|BACKGROUND: This study searches the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) used in a previous project, aiming for reconstructing possible cerebrovascular disease-related groups (DRG),and estimating the costs between cerebrovascular disease and related diseases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in stroke inpatients, we examined the overall costs in 3 municipalities in Taiwan, by evaluating the possible costs of the expecting diagnosis related group (DRG) by using the international classification of diseases version-9 (ICD-9) system, and the overall analysis of the re-admission population that received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment and those who did not. RESULTS: The trend demonstrated that the non-participant costs were consistent with the ICD-9 categories (430 to 437) because similarities existed between years 2006 to 2007. Among the TCM patients, a wide variation and additional costs were found compared to non-TCM patients during these 2 years. The average re-admission duration was significantly shorter for TCM patients, especially those initially diagnosed with ICD 434 during the first admission. In addition, TCM patients demonstrated more severe general symptoms, which incurred high conventional treatment costs, and could result in re-admission for numerous reasons. However, in Disease 7 of ICD-9 category, representing the circulatory system was most prevalent in non-TCM inpatients, which was the leading cause of re-admission. CONCLUSION: We concluded that favorable circulatory system outcomes were in adjuvant TCM treatment inpatients, there were less re-admission for circulatory system events and a two-third reduction of re-admission within ICD-9 code 430 to 437, compared to non-TCM ones. However, there were shorter re-admission duration other than circulatory system events by means of unfavorable baseline condition.

24328138|t|Toxins in botanical dietary supplements: blue cohosh components disrupt cellular respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential.
24328138|a|Certain botanical dietary supplements have been associated with idiosyncratic organ-specific toxicity. Similar toxicological events, caused by drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, have forced the withdrawal or U.S. FDA "black box" warnings of major pharmaceuticals. To assess the potential mitochondrial liability of botanical dietary supplements, extracts from 352 authenticated plant samples used in traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic, and Western herbal medicine were evaluated for the ability to disrupt cellular respiration. Blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides) methanol extract exhibited mitochondriotoxic activity. Used by some U.S. midwives to help induce labor, blue cohosh has been associated with perinatal stroke, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, multiple organ injury, and neonatal shock. The potential link between mitochondrial disruption and idiosyncratic herbal intoxication prompted further examination. The C. thalictroides methanol extract and three saponins, cauloside A (1), saponin PE (2), and cauloside C (3), exhibited concentration- and time-dependent mitochondriotoxic activities. Upon treatment, cell respiration rate rapidly increased and then dramatically decreased within minutes. Mechanistic studies revealed that C. thalictroides constituents impair mitochondrial function by disrupting membrane integrity. These studies provide a potential etiological link between this mitochondria-sensitive form of cytotoxicity and idiosyncratic organ damage.

24157854|t|Electro-acupuncture at points of Zusanli and Quchi exerts anti-apoptotic effect through the modulation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
24157854|a|We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and deeply investigated the relationship between this neuroprotective effect and PI3K/Akt pathway. Rats underwent focal cerebral IR injured by suture method and received the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of EA at points of Zusanli(ST36) and Quchi(LI11) after the operation. We found that the EA treatment significantly (p<0.05) improved neurological deficit and cerebral infarction. Furthermore, EA profoundly activated PI3K/Akt signaling resulted in the inhibition of cerebral cell apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra. Simultaneously EA increased the expression of PI3K, p-Akt, p-Bad and Bcl-2 at the protein level and the expression of Bcl-2 at the mRNA level. On the contrary, EA inhibited the Bax and cleaved Caspase-3-positive expression. The selective PI3K inhibitor LY294002 compromised EA-induced neuroprotective effects and reduced the elevation of p-Akt, p-Bad and Bcl-2 levels. Our data suggested that the PI3K/Akt pathway played a critical role in mediating the neuroprotective effects of EA treatment at points of Zusanli and Quchi after the ischemic stroke.

26019500|t|Protective effects of traditional Chinese medicine formula NaoShuanTong capsule on haemorheology and cerebral energy metabolism disorders in rats with blood stasis.
26019500|a|NaoShuanTong capsule (NSTC), an oral traditional Chinese medicine formula, is composed of Pollen Typhae, Radix Paeoniae Rubra, Rhizoma Gastrodiae, Radix Rhapontici and Radix Curcumae. It has been widely used to treat ischemic stroke in clinic for many years in China. In addition to neuronal apoptosis, haemorheology and cerebral energy metabolism disorders also play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of ischemic stroke. The present study was designed to evaluate the in vivo protective effects of NSTC on haemorheology and cerebral energy metabolism disorders in rats with blood stasis. Sixty specific pathogen-free sprague-dawley rats, male only, were randomly divided into six groups (control group, model group, aspirin (100 mg/kg/d) group, NSTC low-dose (400 mg/kg/d) group, NSTC intermediate-dose (800 mg/kg/d) group, NSTC high-dose (1600 mg/kg/d) group) with 10 animals in each. The rats except those in the control group were placed in ice-cold water (0-4 °C) for 5 min during the time interval (4 h) of two adrenaline hydrochloride injections (0.8 mg/kg) to induce blood stasis. After treatment, whole blood viscosity at three shear rates, plasma viscosity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate significantly decreased in NSTC intermediate- and high-dose groups; erythrocyte aggregation index and red corpuscle electrophoresis index significantly decreased in all the three dose NSTC groups. Moreover, treatment with high-dose NSTC could significantly improve Na+-K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and Ca2+ ATPase activity, as well as lower lactic acid level in brain tissues. These results demonstrated the protective effects of NSTC on haemorheology and cerebral energy metabolism disorders, which may provide scientific information for the further understanding of mechanism(s) of NSTC as a clinical treatment for ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the protective effects of activating blood circulation as observed in this study might create valuable insight for the utilisation of NSTC to be a feasible alternative therapeutic agent for patients with blood stasis.

24707870|t|Study on integrated pharmacokinetics of gardenia acid and geniposide: time-antioxidant efficacy after oral administration of Huanglian-Zhizi couplet medicine from Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang in MCAO rats.
24707870|a|Huanglian-Zhizi couplet medicine comes from classical prescription Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT), which has been proven by previous researches to be an effective compound for cerebral ischemia. This paper explores the integrated pharmacokinetics of gardenia acid and geniposide-time-antioxidant efficacy after the oral administration of Huanglian-Zhizi couplet medicine from HLJDT in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). To investigate the differences in pharmacokinetics and antioxidant effect of Huanglian-Zhizi and HLJDT in MCAO rats, which have been scarcely reported, an oral dose, 24 crud drug g/kg, of Huanglian-Zhizi and 40 crud drug/kg of HLJDT were administered in two groups of normal rats and two groups of Sprague-Dawley (SD) MCAO rats, respectively. At different time points, concentrations of gardenia acid and geniposide were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were calculated by ELIASA. Pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC, MRT, t1/2, T max , C max were estimated by statistical moment analysis using a data analysis system (DAS) 2.0. An AUC based on weighting approach was used for integrating gardenia acid and geniposide. Finally, the concentration-time efficacy profiles were obtained. The integrated pharmacokinetics profiles of index components could reveal the pharmacokinetics behavior of Huanglian-Zhizi and HLJDT, corresponding to the antioxidant efficacy.

24305623|t|Therapeutic effects of multifunctional tetramethylpyrazine nitrone on models of Parkinson's disease in vitro and in vivo.
24305623|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Although the etiology of PD is not completely understood, it is well-documented that oxidative stress and Ca(2+)-mediated cellular damage play important roles in the progression of PD. 2-[[(1,1-Dimethylethyl)oxidoimino]-methyl]-3,5,6-trimethylpyrazine (TBN), a novel nitrone derivative of tetramethylpyrazine, has shown significant therapeutic effects in stroke models due to its multiple functions, including calcium overload blockade and free radical-scavenging. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective and neurorescue effects of TBN on various in vitro and in vivo models of PD and explored its possible mechanisms of action. The results show that TBN exerted significant neuroprotection on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced damage in SH-SY5Y cells and primary dopaminergic neurons, as well as on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neuron loss in zebrafish (TBN and MPTP were added simultaneously into the fish embryo medium and the treatment period was 48 h). In the MPTP-induced mouse and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat PD models, TBN administrated orally twice daily for 14 d (3 d post-MPTP lesion in mice and 7 d post-6-OHDA lesion in rats) exhibited remarkable neurorescue effects to increase the number of dopaminergic neurons. In addition, TBN improved apomorphine-induced rotational behavior in the 6-OHDA-lesioned PD rats. TBN suppressed the MPP(+)-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SH-SY5Y cells, increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) concentration in the substantial nigra of MPTP-treated mice. These data indicate that TBN protects and rescues dopaminergic neurons from MPP(+) and MPTP/6-OHDA-induced damage by reducing ROS and increasing cellular antioxidative defense capability.

25050380|t|Treatment of cardiovascular disease by traditional Chinese medicine against pregnane X receptor.
25050380|a|Recently, cardiovascular disease, also known as loop circulatory system diseases or disorders, is one of the serious diseases including heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, hypertension, hypotension, and thrombosis. Human pregnane X receptor, PXR, plays a crucial role in exogenous and endobiotic metabolism for rabbit, rat, mouse, and human. The PXR activation can protect the blood vessels from damage of hazardous substances. In this study we aim to investigate the potent lead compounds as PXR receptor agonist against cardiovascular disease. To improve drug development of TCM compounds, we aim to investigate the potent lead compounds as PXR agonists from the TCM compounds in TCM Database@Taiwan. The top three TCM compounds, bis(4-hydroxybenzyl) ether mono-β-D-glucopyranoside (BEMG), ixerisoside, and tangshenoside II, have displayed higher potent binding affinities than the positive control, PNU-142721, in the docking simulation. After MD simulations, which can optimize the result of docking simulation and validate the stability of H-bonds between each ligand and PXR protein under dynamic conditions, top TCM compounds, BEMG and tangshenoside II, maintain most of interactions with PXR protein, which keep the ligand binding stable in the binding domain. Hence, we propose BEMG and tangshenoside II as potential lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the PXR protein.

24636189|a|This review reports on recent findings concerning the effects of acupuncture and electroacupuncture (EA) on stem cell mobilization and differentiation, in particular with regard to neurogenesis. Traditional Chinese acupuncture has a history of over 2,500 years and is becoming more popular worldwide. Evidence has demonstrated that acupuncture may be of benefit in stroke rehabilitation, parkinsonism, dementia, and depression. This article reviews recent studies concerning the effects of acupuncture/EA on stem cell mobilization and on progenitor cell proliferation in the CNS. The reviewed evidence indicates that acupuncture/EA has beneficial effects in several neurodegenerative diseases, and it may prove to be a nondrug method for mobilizing stem cells in the CNS.

23529833|t|Exploring molecular mechanism underlying Chinese medicine syndrome: a study on correlation between Chinese medicine syndrome and biomarkers for ischemic stroke.
23529833|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether Chinese medicine (CM) syndrome is associated with particular molecular mechanism, we explored the correlation between CM syndrome and changes of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in patients with ischemic stroke, which were reported to play an important role in the inflammatory and apoptosis cascade. METHODS: CM syndrome factors of 175 patients with ischemic stroke were assessed using Ischemic Stroke CM Syndrome Factor Diagnostic Scale (ISTSFDS). The patients were grouped according to the main syndrome factor combinations at different time points based on distribution probability of syndrome factor combinations. Blood levels of ICAM-1, MMP-9 and HSP70 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: ICAM-1 expression was significantly higher in the internal-wind+phlegm-dampness+blood-stasis, phlegmdampness+ blood-stasis, internal-fire+phlegm-dampness+blood-stasis group than that in the blood-stasis+qideficiency group within 72 h from stroke onset (P <0.05); HSP70 expression was significantly lower in the phlegm-dampness+blood-stasis, internal-fire+phlegm-dampness+blood-stasis, blood-stasis group than that in the phlegm-dampness+blood-stasis+qi-deficiency group on the 7th day from stroke onset (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Phlegm-dampness and blood-stasis exist through the whole process of ischemic stroke. An increased level of ICAM-1 and a reduced level of HSP70 reflect the pathological state of phlegm-stasis mutual binding. These results suggest that inflammation and apoptosis induced by cerebral vascular injury in the pathological processes of ischemic stroke are more prominent in the excess syndrome state like phlegm-dampness and blood-stasis.

23370158|t|Differences in the beat-to-beat parameters of skin-surface pulsatile laser-Doppler waveforms between stroke and normal subjects.
23370158|a|Walking can help improve the recovery after stroke. The present study used skin-surface laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) measurements and beat-to-beat waveform analysis with the aim of discriminating the microcirculatory blood flow (MBF) characteristics in stroke subjects subdivided into two groups according to their walking ability. Five-minute LDF measurements were performed in the following groups: Group A (cannot walk independently; n = 17), Group B (can walk independently; n = 11), and Group C (healthy controls; n = 17). The pulse width (PW) and foot delay time (FDT) and their coefficients of variation (PWCV and FDTCV, respectively) were calculated for the beat-to-beat LDF waveform. The FDT in Group A and the blood-pressure-normalized PW in Group C were significantly longer than the corresponding values in the other groups, and PWCV and FDTCV were significantly larger in Group C than in Group A. To our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of using a beat-to-beat LDF waveform index to discriminate between stroke subjects with different walking abilities and between stroke and normal subjects. It provides a noninvasive and real-time method for discriminating MBF characteristics, and thus could aid the development of an index for the early detection of stroke or for evaluating the recovery condition in stroke patients.

25587341|a|In Chinese medicine-based therapeutics, Angong Niuhuang pill (ANP) is one of the three most effective formulas for febrile diseases, and it is also used to treat other diseases. This paper reviews current knowledge regarding the clinical and pharmacological effects of ANP for treating different central nervous system (CNS) diseases to confirm its validity and efficacy. These diseases are like centric fever, coma, stroke, and viral encephalitis. This review reveals that various diseases could be treated using the same agent, which is one of the most important principles of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). According to the "Same Treatment for Different Diseases" principle, ANP might be efficacious in other CNS diseases.

25548595|t|Effect of integrated cognitive therapy on hippocampal functional connectivity patterns in stroke patients with cognitive dysfunction: a resting-state FMRI study.
25548595|a|Objective. This study aimed to identify abnormal hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) following ischemic stroke using resting-state fMRI. We also explored whether abnormal hippocampal FC could be modulated by integrated cognitive therapy and tested whether these alterations were associated with cognitive performance. Methods. 18 right-handed cognitively impaired ischemic stroke patients and 18 healty control (HC) subjects were included in this study. Stroke subjects were scanned at baseline and after integrated cognitive therapy, while HCs were only scanned at baseline, to identify regions that show significant correlations with the seed region. Behavioral and cognitive assessments were obtained before each scan. Results. During the resting state, we found abnormal hippocampal FC associated with temporal regions, insular cortex, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex in stroke patients compared to HCs. After integrated cognitive therapy, however, the stroke group showed increased hippocampal FC mainly located in the prefrontal gyrus and the default mode network (DMN). Altered hippocampal FC was associated with cognitive improvement. Conclusion. Resting-state fMRI may provide novel insight into the study of functional networks in the brain after stroke. Furthermore, altered hippocampal FC may be a compensatory mechanism for cognitive recovery after ischemic stroke.

25477996|t|Effect of "Deqi" during the Study of Needling "Wang's Jiaji" Acupoints Treating Spasticity after Stroke.
25477996|a|Background. Acupuncture has been shown to reduce spasticity and prevent the onset of spasticity after stroke. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of "Deqi" during needling "Wang's Jiaji" acupoints treating spasticity in the early stage of stroke. Methods. This study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. 238 patients with stroke (<21 days) participated and were randomly allocated to the verum-acupuncture (n = 121) group or sham-acupuncture group (n = 117). The verum-acupuncture group received verum acupuncture required to produce the sense of "Deqi" while the sham-acupuncture group received sham acupuncture without "Deqi." Patients in both groups followed the same 30 min acupuncture regimen 5 times per week for a period of 4 weeks. Scales of MAS, FMA, ADL, MBI, NIHSS, SS-QOL, and MRS were measured at baseline and at 2, 4, and 12 weeks after intervention. Results. Significant differences were observed between two groups. The MRS rating composition has the statistical difference after 4 weeks (P = 0.017). The score of MAS, FMA, Barthel, and SSQOL in verum-acupuncture group has increased significantly compared with the sham-acupuncture group after 12 weeks. There was 14% reduction of higher muscle tension in the verum-acupuncture group. Conclusion. Acupuncture "Wang's Jiaji" points with sensation of "Deqi" in the early stage may reduce the occurrence and decrease the severity of spasticity after stroke.

25126102|t|Neurotrophic Signaling Factors in Brain Ischemia/Reperfusion Rats: Differential Modulation Pattern between Single-Time and Multiple Electroacupuncture Stimulation.
25126102|a|Electroacupuncture (EA) treatment has been widely used for stroke-like disorders in traditional Chinese medicine. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous studies showed that single-time EA stimulation at "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Shuigou" (GV 26) after the onset of ischemia can protect the brain against ischemic injury in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Here, we further investigated the differential effects between multiple EA and single-time EA stimulation on ischemic injury. In the present study, we found that both single-time EA and multiple EA stimulation significantly reduced MCAO-induced ischemic infarction, while only multiple EA attenuated sensorimotor dysfunctions. Also, with PCR array screening and ingenuity gene analysis, we revealed that multiple EA and single-time EA stimulation could differentially induce expression changes in neurotrophic signaling related genes. Meanwhile, with western blotting, we demonstrated that the level of glia maturation factor β (GMFβ) increased in the early stage (day 1) of reperfusion, and this upregulation was suppressed only by single-time EA stimulation. These findings suggest that the short-term effect of single-time EA stimulation differs from the cumulative effect of multiple EA, which possibly depends on their differential modulation on neurotrophic signaling molecules expression.

25126100|t|Buyang huanwu decoction for healthcare: evidence-based theoretical interpretations of treating different diseases with the same method and target of vascularity.
25126100|a|Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD) is a famous herbal prescription that has been used to treat stroke for centuries. Recent studies reported that the use of BHD had been extended to treat various kinds of disorders according to the TCM syndrome theory of Treating Different Diseases with the Same Method (TDDSM). Here, an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) of BHD for healthcare was conducted to interpret the TCM theory of TDDSM and its target of vascularity in an evidence-based manner. Literature searches were carried out in 5 databases to search SRs of BHD for any indication up to August 2013. Thirteen eligible SRs were identified which reported a wide range of vascular conditions. Based on the Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire scores, the quality of included SRs was varied, with an average score of 4 points. We found that there is premature evidence for the use of BHD for healthcare, whereas BHD was well tolerable in all patients. BHD can be used to treat many disorders with the same therapeutic principle of invigorating Qi to activate blood circulation, which is essentially a manifestation of the TDDSM and is likely to account for targeting the specific pathogenesis of vascular diseases.

25009574|t|Electroacupuncture treatment improves neurological function associated with regulation of tight junction proteins in rats with cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury.
25009574|a|Strategies to develop effective neuroprotective therapy to reduce brain damage and related behavioral deficits in stroke patients are of great significance. Electroacupuncture (EA), which derives from traditional Chinese medicine, may be effective as a complementary and alternative method for promoting recovery of neurological function and quality of life. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: (1) sham, (2) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model groups of 2 h MCAO followed by 1, 3, 5, or 7 d of reperfusion, and (3) EA groups of 2 h MCAO followed by 1, 3, 5, or 7 d of reperfusion. EA groups received EA therapy by needling at GV20 and left ST36. The results show that EA therapy improved the neurological function and reduced infarct volume, confirmed by modified neurological severity scores and TTC staining. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blot assay verified that EA upregulated the expression of tight junction (TJ) claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occluding-1 from 1 to 7 d after reperfusion. Our findings suggest that EA reduces brain damage and related behavioral deficits via upregulation of the TJ proteins.

24864151|t|Salidroside Reduces Cell Mobility via NF- κ B and MAPK Signaling in LPS-Induced BV2 Microglial Cells.
24864151|a|The unregulated activation of microglia following stroke results in the production of toxic factors that propagate secondary neuronal injury. Salidroside has been shown to exhibit protective effects against neuronal death induced by different insults. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of salidroside have not been elucidated clearly in microglia. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying inhibiting LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cell mobility of salidroside. The protective effect of salidroside was investigated in microglial BV2 cell, subjected to stretch injury. Moreover, transwell migration assay demonstrated that salidroside significantly reduced cell motility. Our results also indicated that salidroside suppressed LPS-induced chemokines production in a dose-dependent manner, without causing cytotoxicity in BV2 microglial cells. Moreover, salidroside suppressed LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF- κ B) by blocking degradation of I κ B α and phosphorylation of MAPK (p38, JNK, ERK1/2), which resulted in inhibition of chemokine expression. These results suggest that salidroside possesses a potent suppressive effect on cell migration of BV2 microglia and this compound may offer substantial therapeutic potential for treatment of ischemic strokes that are accompanied by microglial activation.

24782904|t|Neuroprotective effect of a formula, moschus combined with borneolum synthcticum, from traditional chinese medicine on ischemia stroke in rats.
24782904|a|Moschus compatible with borneolum synthcticum is a well-known herb pair in Traditional Chinese Medicine and the present study aims to assess the neuroprotective effect of a formula composed of this herb pair on ischemia stroke in rats. The middle cerebral artery occlusion model of focal cerebral ischemia in rat was performed by using intraluminal suture method. The behavioral scores, infarct volume, and neuron ultrastructure of model and formula-treated rats were investigated after the 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Meanwhile the expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2, and Bax were measured by western blot analysis. The formula treatment showed obvious neuroprotective effect according to significant decrease of the neurological scores (P < 0.01) and the infarct volumes (P < 0.05) when compared to the MCAO group. We also observed that this formula had antiapoptosis activity on neuron cell under electron microscope. Furthermore, our result supported the idea that pro- and postadministration of this formula had an antiapoptosis effect by decreasing remarkably the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 (P < 0.05) as well as increasing significantly the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax (P < 0.01). All evidences demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of this formula on ischemia stroke due to decrease of brain infract volume and modulation of the expression of apoptosis-related proteins.

24707306|t|Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of xingnaojing treatment for stroke.
24707306|a|Objective. Xingnaojing injection (XNJ) is a well-known traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM) for stroke. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of XNJ for stroke including ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Methods. An extensive search was performed within using eight databases up to November 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on XNJ for treatment of stroke were collected. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and meta-analysis were conducted according to the Cochrane standards, and RevMan5.0 was used for meta-analysis. Results. This review included 13 RCTs and a total of 1,514 subjects. The overall methodological quality was poor. The meta-analysis showed that XNJ combined with conventional treatment was more effective for total efficacy, neurological deficit improvement, and reduction of TNF- α levels compared with those of conventional treatment alone. Three trials reported adverse events, of these one trial reported mild impairment of kidney and liver function, whereas the other two studies failed to report specific adverse events. Conclusion. Despite the limitations of this review, we suggest that XNJ in combination with conventional medicines might be beneficial for the treatment of stroke. Currently there are various methodological problems in the studies. Therefore, high-quality, large-scale RCTs are urgently needed.

25224186|t|Effects of routine rehabilitation training on glucose tolerance among nondiabetic stroke patients: a pilot study.
25224186|a|OBJECTIVE: Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetic glucose tolerance (DGT) are closely associated with vascular disease mortality and morbidity. This study was designed to determine whether routine stroke rehabilitation training can be used to improve the glucose status and whether IGT and DGT persist among nondiabetic stroke patients at discharge after such training. METHODS: Eighty eligible subjects were evaluated using Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests (OGTTs) at entry and discharge at the rehabilitation medical departments of two large hospitals in China. Routine rehabilitation training was provided during hospitalization. The secondary outcome measurements were BMI, Fugl-Meyer motor score, Barthel index, HbA1c, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Non-acute and nondiabetic stroke patients treated at the rehabilitation department. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients had IGT or DGT at entry, while 61 patients exhibited abnormal glucose tolerance at discharge, accounting for 67.7% and 76.25% of all subjects respectively. The mean 2-hour plasma glucose level was 8.98 mmol/L at entry and 9.11 mmol/L at discharge. No changes were noted in the OGTT results or secondary outcomes after training (p>0.05), with the exceptions of significant improvements in the Fugl-Meyer motor score and Barthel index (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that IGT and DGT are present at a high frequency among nondiabetic stroke patients both before and after routine rehabilitation training. Routine stroke rehabilitation training, which greatly improves functional outcomes, may have no effect on the incidence of abnormal glucose tolerance.

25078873|t|Optimal dairy intake is predicated on total, cardiovascular, and stroke mortalities in a Taiwanese cohort.
25078873|a|OBJECTIVE: Dairy foods help achieve essential nutrient adequacy. This role may be conflicted where so-called chronic diseases prevail. We have examined associations between dairy intake and mortality where dairy foods have not been traditional. METHODS: A representative Taiwanese cohort of 3810 subjects, aged 19-64 years, derived from the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (NAHSIT, 1993-1996) was linked to death registration (1993-2008). Participants were categorized by 4 dairy weekly intake frequencies from 0 to >7 times. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: Nonconsumers of dairy products included 30.7% of the men and 22.1% of the women. Adverse sociodemographic and personal behaviors were generally significantly associated with lower dairy consumption. After adjustment for covariates, together with body mass index (BMI) and supplement use, those with 3-7 times/week intakes had an HR (95% CI) for all-cause mortality of 0.61 (0.39-0.96) with a significant dose-response trend (p = 0.043). Similarly, the HR for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality with dairy weekly intake frequency >7 was 0.14 (0.02-0.97) with a significant linear trend (p = 0.007). For stroke, the corresponding HR (95% CI) was 0.03 (0.00-0.28) with a linear trend. By age and with adjustment for dietary quality, food, and calcium or vitamin D intake, significance and dose-response relationships remained. Dairy intake and cancer mortality were not associated. CONCLUSION: In a Chinese food culture, a dairy foods intake in adults up to 7 times a week does not increase mortality and may have favorable effects on stroke.

23600691|t|Molecular level activation insights from a NR2A/NR2B agonist.
23600691|a|N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), a subclass of glutamate receptors have broad actions in neural transmission for major brain functions. Overactivation of NMDARs leading to "excitotoxicity" is the underlying mechanism of neuronal death in a number of neurological diseases, especially stroke. Much research effort has been directed toward developing pharmacological agents to modulate NMDAR actions for treating neurological diseases, in particular stroke. Here, we report that Alliin, a sulfoxide in fresh garlic, exhibits affinity toward NR2A as well as NR2B receptors based on virtual screening. Biological activities of Alliin on these two receptors were confirmed in electrophysiological studies. Ligand-binding site closure, a structural change precluding ion channel opening, was observed with Alliin during 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation. Alliin interactions with NR2A and NR2B suggest that residues E/A413, H485, T690, and Y730 may play important roles in the conformation shift. Activation of NR2A and NR2B by Alliin can be differentiated from that caused by glutamate, the endogenous neurotransmitter. These characteristic molecular features in NR2A and NR2B activation provide insight into structural requirements for future development of novel drugs with selective interaction with NR2A and NR2B for treating neurological diseases, particularly stroke.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham, cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), and cerebral ischemia and reperfusion plus XXMD (60 g/kg/day) (XXMD60). Focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion models were induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Cerebral ischemic injury was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Ultrastructural features of mitochondria in the penumbra of the ischemic cortex were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and cleaved caspase 3 immunohistochemistry. Proteins in the mitochondrial p53 pathway were detected by western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The results showed that XXMD treatment markedly attenuated ischemic changes, preserved mitochondrial integrity, and significantly reduced apoptosis. In addition, we found that XXMD treatment reduced p53 and Bax levels and increased Bcl-2 levels in mitochondrial fractions. XXMD significantly blocked the release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo from mitochondria, and inhibited activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 in cytoplasmic fractions. Increased expression of c-IAP1 was observed in the XXMD60 group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated that XXMD protected mitochondria from ischemic injury and inhibited apoptosis. The mitochondrial p53 pathway could be partially involved in the protective effects.

24051274|t|Neuroprotective effects of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction on ischemic stroke rats revealed by (1)H NMR metabolomics approach.
24051274|a|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) is a representative antipyretic and detoxifying recipe in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). This formula and its component herbs like Radix Scutellariae, Fructus Gardeniae show a variety of neuroprotective activities and have been used for the treatment of nervous system diseases including stroke. To comprehensively and holistically assess its therapeutic effect on ischemic stroke, a novel integrative metabolomics approach was applied. A rat ischemic stroke model was established by introduction of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. The neurological deficit, cerebral infarct size and morphological abnormality were evaluated. An NMR technique combined with appropriate statistical analyses was then performed to explore the metabonomic profiles of serum and brain tissue extracts. Pattern analysis of the (1)H NMR data disclosed that HLJDD could relieve stroke rats suffering from the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by ameliorating the disturbance in energy metabolism, membrane and mitochondrial metabolism, neurotransmitter and amino acid metabolism, alleviating the oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the inflammatory damage, and recovering the destructed osmoregulation.

24361538|t|Effects of acupuncture on declined cerebral blood flow, impaired mitochondrial respiratory function and oxidative stress in multi-infarct dementia rats.
24361538|a|Brain energy disorders and oxidative stress due to chronic hypoperfusion were considered to be the major risk factors in the pathogenesis of dementia. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that acupuncture treatment improved cognitive function of VaD patients and multi-infarct dementia (MID) rats. Acupuncture therapy also increased the activities of glycometabolic enzymes in the brain. But it is not clear whether acupuncture treatment compensates neuronal energy deficit after cerebral ischemic through enhancing the activities of glucose metabolic enzymes and preserving mitochondrial function, and whether acupuncture neuroprotective effect is associated with activations of mitochondrial antioxidative defense system. So, the effect of acupuncture therapy on cognitive function, cerebral blood flow (CBF), mitochondrial respiratory function and oxidative stress in the brain of MID rats was investigated in this study. The results showed that acupuncture treatment significantly improved cognitive abilities and increased regional CBF of MID rats. Acupuncture elevated the activities of total SOD, CuZnSOD and MnSOD, decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide anion, regulated the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in mitochondria, and raised the level of the respiratory control index (RCI) and P/O ratio and the activities of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes of MID rats. These results indicated that acupuncture treatment improved cognitive function of MID rats; and this improvement might be due to increased CBF, which ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction induced by ischemia and endogenous oxidative stress system of brain.

24927788|t|Tongxinluo attenuates neuronal loss and enhances neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the ipsilateral thalamus and improves neurological outcome after focal cortical infarction in hypertensive rats.
24927788|a|PURPOSE: Tongxinluo, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine complex, has been widely used for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases in China. The present study was to explore whether treatment with tongxinluo could improve neurological function and alleviate secondary damage in the ipsilateral thalamus after focal cortical infarction in hypertensive rats. METHODS: Tongxinluo was given through oral gavage starting 24 h after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neurological function was assessed and then rats were sacrificed 7 and 14 days after MCAO. Brains were harvested for examining infarction volume, Nissl staining and immunofluorescence analysis. RESULTS: Compared with vehicle treatment, tongxinluo remarkably improved neurological function without reducing infarction volume, attenuated neuronal loss and astrocyte activation in the ipsilateral thalamus 7 and 14 days after MCAO (all p < 0.05). Also, tongxinluo markedly increased the number of BrdU+/nestin+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ cells 14 days after MCAO. Moreover, vascular density, the number of BrdU+ vascular endothelial cells, and vascular perimeter in the ipsilateral thalamus were markedly increased in the tongxinluo group relative to that of the vehicle group (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Administration of tongxinluo 24 h after cortical infarction may promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the ipsilateral thalamus and improves neurological function after cortical infarction in rats.

24253542|t|Longitudinal effects of a decade of aging on carotid artery stiffness: the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis.
24253542|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Arterial stiffening is associated with hypertension, stroke, and cognitive decline; however, the effects of aging and cardiovascular disease risk factors on carotid artery stiffening have not been assessed prospectively in a large multiethnic longitudinal study. METHODS: Distensibility coefficient and the Young's elastic modulus (YEM) of the right common carotid artery were calculated at baseline and after a mean of 9.4 (standard deviation [SD], 0.5) years in 2650 participants. Effects of age and cardiovascular disease risk factors were evaluated by multivariable mixed regression and ANCOVA models. RESULTS: At baseline, participants were 59.9 (SD, 9.4) years old (53% women; 25% black, 22% Hispanic, 14% Chinese). YEM increased from 1581 (SD, 927) to 1749 (SD, 1306) mm Hg (P<0.0001), and distensibility coefficient decreased from 3.1 (SD, 1.3) to 2.7 (SD, 1.1)×10(-3) mm Hg(-1) (P<0.001), indicating progressive arterial stiffening. YEM increased more among participants who were aged>75 years old at baseline (P<0.0001). In multivariable analyses, older age and less education independently predicted worsening YEM and distensibility coefficient. Stopping antihypertensive medication during the study period predicted more severe worsening of YEM (β=360.2 mm Hg; P=0.008). Starting antihypertensive medication after examination 1 was predictive of improvements in distensibility coefficient (β=1.1×10(-4) mm Hg(-1); P=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffening accelerates with advanced age. Older individuals experience greater increases in YEM than do younger adults, even after considering the effects of traditional risk factors. Treating hypertension may slow the progressive decline in carotid artery distensibility observed with aging and improve cerebrovascular health.

24616454|t|[Thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke: issues and options].
24616454|a|China is one of the countries with highest incidence of stroke in the world. However, the rate of intravenous thrombolysis for ischemic stroke is extremely low in China, which is related to traditional triage system and inefficient management, the potential of hemorrhagic transformation, and narrow therapeutic time window. In order to improve the clinical implementation of thrombolysis, it is necessary to look at the related issues and to refine the therapeutic protocol according to the international experiences. Careful screening of eligible patients is crucial to reduce the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. The advanced penumbral imaging is believed to enhance patient selection and extend the therapeutic time window. In addition, endovascular therapy is increasingly utilized to raise the recanalization rate. All these measures would enhance the improvement of the clinical management for acute stroke patients.

24127065|t|GuaLou GuiZhi decoction inhibits LPS-induced microglial cell motility through the MAPK signaling pathway.
24127065|a|Microglial activation plays an important role in neroinflammation following ischemic stroke. Activated microglial cells can then migrate to the site of injury to proliferate and release substances which induce secondary brain damage. It has been shown that microglial migration is associated with the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. The Chinese formula, GuaLou GuiZhi decoction (GLGZD), has long been administered in clinical practice for the treatment of post-stroke disabilities, such as muscular spasticity. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the anti-inflammtory effects of GLGZD were mediated by the TLR4/NF-κB pathway in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the role of GLGZD in microglial migration by performing scratch wound assays and migration assays. We wished to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms elicited by this TCM formula in microglial-induced inflammation by evaluating the release and expression of chemotactic cytokines [monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) and interleukin (IL)-8] by ELISA and quantitative PCR. Our results revealed that the migration of microglial cells was enhanced in the presence of LPS (100 ng/ml); however, GLGZD (100 µg/ml) significantly inhibited cell motility and the production of chemokines through the inhibition of the activation of the p38 and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. We demonstrate the potential of GLGZD in the modulation of microglial motility by investigating the effects of GLGZD on microglial migration induced by LPS. Taken together, our data suggest that GLGZD per se cannot trigger microglial motility, whereas GLGZD impedes LPS-induced microglial migration through the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. These results provide further evidence of the anti-inflammatory effects of GLGZD and its potential for use in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

24145892|t|Mechanical antithrombotic intervention by LAA occlusion in atrial fibrillation.
24145892|a|Stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is often associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Oral anticoagulation remains the first-line approach to stroke prevention in such individuals; however, for a considerable proportion of patients, traditional treatment using warfarin is limited by a number of factors, such as the inconvenience of frequent therapeutic monitoring and the risk of haemorrhage. The development of new oral anticoagulants with improved efficacy and safety profiles has provided viable options for oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with nonvalvular (nonrheumatic AF). Nonetheless, in patients who have an increased risk of major haemorrhage, a nonpharmacological approach to antithrombotic therapy remains an attractive alternative. The left atrial appendage (LAA) has been found to be the source of >90% of thrombi in patients with nonvalvular AF; thus, prevention of thrombus formation via transcatheter mechanical LAA occlusion is a novel therapeutic target for stroke prevention in this patient population. In this Review, we present the rationale for LAA occlusion in patients with AF, the available occlusion devices and their clinical evidence to date. We also discuss the roles of various imaging techniques in device implantation and the management strategy for associated procedural complications.

24423905|t|[Analysis of acute stroke trials conducted in mainland China in the past 17 years].
24423905|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current status and trend of acute stroke randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Mainland China. METHODS: Acute stroke RCTs were retrieved from 8 databases published in Chinese or English language from January 1996 to May 2013. Those with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or traumatic hemorrhage were excluded. Methodological items were referred to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. The definitions of Wade were used to assess the outcome measures. The data were processed by SPSS 16.0. Data were summarized as frequency (and %) or median and interquartile range. Difference in proportions was assessed with χ(2) test. RESULTS: A total of 13 493 RCTs were identified. The number of acute stroke RCTs increased by years, but only 52 multi-center RCTs were published. There were 13 multi-center placebo controlled drug trials. Among them, only 3 had a sample size of over 500 cases. In multi-center non-drug trials, only 3 used allocation concealment. The studied types of stroke included ischemic stroke (63.9%, 8623/13 493), intracerebral hemorrhage (30.8%, 4157/13 493) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (5.3%, 713/13 495). There were 61.5% (32/52) multi-center drug trials, including 65.6% (21/32) in Western drug treatment and 34.4% (11/32) in traditional Chinese medicine. There were 38.5% (20/52) non-drug trials including 8 physical therapy, 7 surgery and 5 acupuncture treatment. There were 2 multi-center placebo controlled drug trials and 2 multi-center non-drug trials used mortality/disability for assessing outcome measures over a follow-up period of 90 days or more. CONCLUSION: In the past 17 years in mainland China, the number of acute stroke RCTs has increased dramatically, but the high-quality trials are scarce. The future acute stroke trials should pay more attention to true randomization, blinding and better patient outcome measures.

24348193|t|Pharmacological effects of active compounds on neurodegenerative disease with gastrodia and uncaria decoction, a commonly used poststroke decoction.
24348193|a|Neurodegenerative diseases refer to the selective loss of neuronal systems in patients. The diseases cause high morbidity and mortality to approximately 22 million people worldwide and the number is expected to be tripled by 2050. Up to now, there is no effective prevention and treatment for the neurodegenerative diseases. Although some of the clinical therapies target at slowing down the progression of symptoms of the diseases, the general effectiveness of the drugs has been far from satisfactory. Traditional Chinese medicine becomes popular alternative remedies as it has been practiced clinically for more than thousands of years in China. As neurodegenerative diseases are mediated through different pathways, herbal decoction with multiple herbs is used as an effective therapeutic approach to work on multiple targets. Gastrodia and Uncaria Decoction, a popular TCM decoction, has been used to treat stroke in China. The decoction contains compounds including alkaloids, flavonoids, iridoids, carotenoids, and natural phenols, which have been found to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiapoptotic effects. In this review, we will summarize the recent publications of the pharmacological effects of these five groups of compounds. Understanding the mechanisms of action of these compounds may provide new treatment opportunities for the patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

24236065|t|An effective solution to discover synergistic drugs for anti-cerebral ischemia from traditional Chinese medicinal formulae.
24236065|a|Recently, the pharmaceutical industry has shifted to pursuing combination therapies that comprise more than one active ingredient. Interestingly, combination therapies have been used for more than 2500 years in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Understanding optimal proportions and synergistic mechanisms of multi-component drugs are critical for developing novel strategies to combat complex diseases. A new multi-objective optimization algorithm based on least angle regression-partial least squares was proposed to construct the predictive model to evaluate the synergistic effect of the three components of a novel combination drug Yi-qi-jie-du formula (YJ), which came from clinical TCM prescription for the treatment of encephalopathy. Optimal proportion of the three components, ginsenosides (G), berberine (B) and jasminoidin (J) was determined via particle swarm optimum. Furthermore, the combination mechanisms were interpreted using PLS VIP and principal components analysis. The results showed that YJ had optimal proportion 3(G): 2(B): 0.5(J), and it yielded synergy in the treatment of rats impaired by middle cerebral artery occlusion induced focal cerebral ischemia. YJ with optimal proportion had good pharmacological effects on acute ischemic stroke. The mechanisms study demonstrated that the combination of G, B and J could exhibit the strongest synergistic effect. J might play an indispensable role in the formula, especially when combined with B for the acute stage of stroke. All these data in this study suggested that in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, besides restoring blood supply and protecting easily damaged cells in the area of the ischemic penumbra as early as possible, we should pay more attention to the removal of the toxic metabolites at the same time. Mathematical system modeling may be an essential tool for the analysis of the complex pharmacological effects of multi-component drug. The powerful mathematical analysis method could greatly improve the efficiency in finding new combination drug from TCM.

24170631|t|Cluster analysis for acupoint specificity of acupuncture effect based on cerebral infarction rat model.
24170631|a|OBJECTIVES: To study the acupoint specificity through the comprehensive evaluation of the acupuncture effect on rat model with the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: Duplicated MCAO model by Zea-longa's thread ligation was assessed by Zausinger's six-point method, and rats with 1-3 scores were chosen to be grouped. According to the randomized and controlled principle, rats were divided into 6 basic control groups (including normal group, sham group, model control group, model group without intervention, Nimodipine group, lateral-to-Renzhong group) and 6 acupuncture groups [including Neiguan (PC6) group, Weizhong (BL40) group, Chize (LU5) group, Sanyinjiao (SP6) group, Renzhong (DU6) group and non-acupoint group]; in each acupoint or non-acupoint 9 different parameter combinations were respectively set by orthogonal intersection method. There were in total 60 groups, and each group had 12 rats. The rats were treated by acupuncture with the lifting-thrusting manipulation every 12 h, in total 6 times. Indices of neurobehavioral scores, cerebral blood flow, infarction rate, microcirculation, and light microscope, etc. were measured. In order to comprehensively evaluate the acupuncture effect to research the specificity of acupoint, a cluster analysis was made with SPSS17.0 for the comprehensive effect scores of the samples computed according to the comprehensive evaluation models, and then sorting and classification were made for the comprehensive effect scores. RESULTS: In the acupuncture groups every acupoint had different therapeutic effect due to different acupuncture parameter combinations; among the acupuncture groups the orders of curative effect were as followings: Neiguan group was of exceptional result, Weizhong group and Sanyinjiao group were of valid results in upper level, Chize group and Renzhong group were of valid results in lower level, and non-acupoint group was of invalid result; the therapeutic result of acupoint group was superior to non-acupoint group; and the curative effect of acupuncture group was also superior to basic control group. CONCLUSION: The acupoint has the specificity of acupuncture effect, and the acupoint specificity is relative.

24170629|t|Therapeutic effects of traditional herbal medicine on cerebral ischemia: a perspective of vascular protection.
24170629|a|Although many agents for acute ischemic stroke treatment have been developed from extensive preclinical studies, most have failed in clinical trials. As a result, researchers are seeking other methods or agents based on previous studies. Among the various prospective approaches, vascular protection might be the key for development of therapeutic agents for stroke and for improvements in the efficacy and safety of conventional therapies. Traditional medicines in Asian countries are based on clinical experiences and literature accumulated over thousands of years. To date, many studies have used traditional herbal medicines to prove or develop new agents based on stroke treatments mentioned in traditional medicinal theory or other clinical data. In the current review, we describe the vascular factors related to ischemic brain damage and the herbal medicines that impact these factors, including Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix, Notoginseng Radix, and Curcumae Rhizoma, based on scientific reports and traditional medical theory. Further, we point out the problems associated with herbal medicines in stroke research and propose better methodologies to address these problems.

23921303|t|Vascular reactivity screen of Chinese medicine danhong injection identifies Danshensu as a NO-independent but PGI2-mediated relaxation factor.
23921303|a|Danhong injection (DHI) is the most prescribed injection form of Chinese medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, and stroke in China. However, its active components and action mechanisms remain poorly defined. We hypothesized that DHI contains active components that could prevent and restore endothelial dysfunction by improving vascular relaxation activity. DHI increased vasorelaxation in vivo and ex vivo of rat aortas. Vascular reactivity screen identified that danshensu was the major relaxation factor in DHI. DHI-mediated endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation was independent on nitric oxide/endothelial nitric oxide synthase but was via prostacyclin pathway by increasing cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 gene expression and prostacyclin production. Our results revealed a previously unknown endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation mechanism by danshensu and together with previously reported activity on ion channels of vascular smooth muscle cells, demonstrated that its dual actions contribute to a multicomponent Chinese herbal medicine that synergistically targets different pathways to achieve its well-documented cardiovascular protective effects.

Because of the potential anabolic effect, musk preparations have been included in the list of medical products containing prohibited substances employed for doping. The application of musk pod formulation was regarded as the reason of some adverse analytical findings in the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. In order to investigate the influence of musk administration on the doping test, we executed a chemical analysis and excretion study. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis demonstrated the diversity of steroid concentrations in musk samples. Furthermore, the δ(13)C-values of steroids from wild deer musk showed more depleted than those of domestic deer musk by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) analysis. Because the steroids from some musk had δ(13)C-values in the range of naturally produced steroids in human body, the possible abuse of this kind of musk is very hard to be detected by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in doping control. Musk grains from wild and domestic deer were administrated for the excretion study respectively. Spot urine samples were collected from two male volunteers before and after 100 mg musk grains administration. The profiles and carbon isotope ratios of urinary steroids were determined by GC-MS and GC/C/IRMS. The ingestion of either wild or domestic deer musk did not lead to the adverse analytical finding of doping control in the single dosage of 100mg.

24494572|t|[Research on effect of Baimai powder effective compounds group promotes neurogenesis and maintains of neural stem cells after cerebral infarction].
24494572|a|The neural stem cells (NSCs), play a crucial role in stroke treatment, which can be regulated by a few of traditional Chinese medicines. In this study, the effect of the Mongolian medicine Baimai powder effective compounds group (BMECG) on the proliferation of NSCs has been investigated. The cultured NSCs which were isolated from newborn rat cerebral cortical in vitro were exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxgenation (OGD/R). The CFSE immunofluorescence staining was employed to identify the proliferation of NSCs by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) was established on Kunming mice, and all groups were ig for 7 d respectively. The neurobehavioral changes was studied with rota-rod treadmill test, after that, the brain of mice were detected by immunohistochemistry with labeling of Nestin and pathological observation at 7 days after BCAO. It was found that, proliferation of NSCs was increased by BMECG in in vitro and in vivo. And BMECG significantly improved the time of staying in the rota-rod, it can promote the foundction of in cerebral cortex. It is concluded that these results further support the hypothesis that neuroprotective effect of BMECG may relate to the ability of stimulating self-renew of NSCs, which can be provided a new insight and strategy of anti-neuropathy of stroke.

24012966|t|Scutellarin and caffeic acid ester fraction, active components of Dengzhanxixin injection, upregulate neurotrophins synthesis and release in hypoxia/reoxygenation rat astrocytes.
24012966|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Scutellarin (Scu) and caffeic acid ester fraction (Caf), the extracts from the traditional Chinese herb, Erigeron breviscapus, are known to ameliorate post ischemic neuronal dysfunction. AIM OF THE STUDY: Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are essential for neuronal growth and survival. We explored the neuroprotective effect of Scu and Caf by synthesis and release of NGF, BDNF and GDNF in rat astrocytes exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation and MACO rats. And the neuroprotection of Scu and Caf was also explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The primary rat astrocytes were cultured in vitro. The temporal mRNA and protein expression profile during hypoxia/reoxygenation were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. The expression of p-CREB, p-Akt, p-MAPKs and Bax were analyzed by western blotting. Cell viability of neuro-2A was measured using CCK-8 and cell cytotoxicity was measured with LDH release. RESULTS: During hypoxia/reoxygenation a similar decrease pattern of NTFs (NGF, BDNF and GDNF) was observed in both mRNA and protein; Scu and Caf enhanced the expressions of NGF, BDNF and GDNF mRNA and protein in astrocytes under hypoxia/reoxygenation condition. CREB and Akt, but not MAPKs ( p-JNK, p-ERK1/2 and p-38) may be involved in the expression of NTFs. Concomitantly, conditioned medium from astrocytes which was treated by Scu or Caf after hypo3h/Reox24h significantly reduced neurotoxicity compared with conditioned medium from hypo3h/Reox24h astrocytes alone, and they show the tendency of increased neurons viability accompanied with Bax changes. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of Scu and Caf might be mediated, at least in part, via a stimulation of the production and release of NTFs through p-CREB and p-Akt signaling. Furthermore, Scu and Caf could antagonistic the hypoxia induced toxicity through astrocytes conditioned medium. Those results suggested that Scu and Caf might have therapeutic potential for stroke.

24339622|t|Opinions about the use of brain natriuretic peptide among acute ischemic stroke patients.
24716184|t|Unique mechanisms of sheng yu decoction ( shèng yù tang) on ischemic stroke mice revealed by an integrated neurofunctional and transcriptome analysis.
24716184|a|Sheng Yu Decoction ( Shèng Yù Tang; SYD) is a popular traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remedy used in treating cardiovascular and brain-related dysfunction clinically; yet, its neuroprotective mechanisms are still unclear. Here, mice were subjected to an acute ischemic stroke to examine the efficacy and mechanisms of action of SYD by an integrated neurofunctional and transcriptome analysis. More than 80% of the mice died within 2 days after ischemic stroke with vehicle treatment. Treatments with SYD (1.0 g/kg, twice daily, orally or p.o.) and recombinant thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA; 10 mg/kg, once daily, intravenously or i.v.) both significantly extended the lifespan as compared to that of the vehicle-treated stroke group. SYD successfully restored brain function, ameliorated cerebral infarction and oxidative stress, and significantly improved neurological deficits in mice with stroke. Molecular impact of SYD by a genome-wide transcriptome analysis using brains from stroke mice showed a total of 162 out of 2081 ischemia-induced probe sets were significantly influenced by SYD. Mining the functional modules and genetic networks of these 162 genes revealed a significant upregulation of neuroprotective genes in Wnt receptor signaling pathway (3 genes) and regulation of cell communication (7 genes) and downregulation of destructive genes in response to stress (13 genes) and in the induction of inflammation (5 genes), cytokine production (4 genes), angiogenesis (3 genes), vasculature (6 genes) and blood vessel (5 genes) development, wound healing (7 genes), defense response (7 genes), chemotaxis (4 genes), immune response (7 genes), antigen processing and presenting (3 genes), and leukocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (2 genes) by SYD. Our results suggest that SYD could protect mice against ischemic stroke primarily through significantly downregulating the damaging genes involved in stress, inflammation, angiogenesis, blood vessel formation, immune responses, and wound healing, as well as upregulating the genes mediating neurogenesis and cell communication, which make SYD beneficial for treating ischemic stroke.

24377218|t|[Post-stroke constipation treated with acupuncture therapy of regulating qi circulation of fu-organ].
24377218|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in the efficacy on post-stroke constipation between acupuncture therapy of regulating qi circulation of fe-organ and Shengxue Tongbian Capsules. METHODS: Seventy-five patients of post-stroke constipation were randomized into an acupuncture group (39 cases) and a Chinese medicine group (36 cases). The unit mode comprehensive therapy of stroke was adopted as basic treatment in the two groups. In the acupuncture group, acupuncture therapy of regulating qi circulation of fu-organ was added at Tianshu (ST 25), Zhigou (TE 6), Qihai (CV 6) and Zusanli (ST 36), once every day. In the Chinese medicine group, Shengrue Tongbian Capsules were supplemented for oral administration, once every day, 10 g each time. The clinical symptom score of constipation was observed before treatment, after 1 and 2 weeks treatment in the two groups, respectively. The efficacy in 1 week and 2 weeks of treatment and the adverse reaction were observed. RESULTS: In 1 and 2 weeks of treatment, the clinical symptom score of constipation was reduced significantly as compared with that before treatment in the two groups (all P < 0.05). The improvements in the acupuncture group were significant than those in the Chinese medicine group in 2 weeks of treatment (8.03 +/- 2.38 vs 9.20 +/- 2.45, P < 0.05). Concerning to the occurrence of adverse reaction, there was 1 case of local bruises in needling local site in the acupuncture group; and there were 1 case of abdominal pain, 3 cases of diarrhea and 2 cases of nausea and vomiting in the Chinese medicine group. CONCLUSION: Both the acupuncture therapy of regulating qi circulation of fu-organ and Shengxue Tongbian Capsules achieve the significant efficacy on post-stroke constipation. The efficacy of the acupuncture therapy of regulating qi circulation of fe-organ is better and the adverse reaction is less after long-term persistent treatment.

24432677|t|[Effect of needling at waiguan (SJ5) on brain glucose metabolism in patients with cerebral infarction].
24432677|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe changes of brain glucose metabolism by needling at Waiguan (SJ5) in cerebral infraction (CI) patients using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission computer tomography (PET/CT), thus exploring its effect and mechanisms. METHODS: A total of 21 patients with CI were recruited in this study. The location of lesion was limited to the left basal ganglia by CT or MRI scan. All patients were randomly assigned to three groups. i.e., the acupoint group (Group A), the non-acupoint group (Group B), the blank control group (Group C), 7 in each group. Patients in Group A were needled at right Waiguan (SJ5). Those in Group B were needled at non-acupoint [10 mm beside Waiguan (SJ5)], whereas those in Group C did not receive any treatment. All patients underwent PET/CT head scan. All data were statistically analyzed using SPSS 13.0 Software and SPM8 Software. RESULTS: Compared with Group C, glucose metabolism increased in bilateral superior temporal gyrus (BA38), right superior frontal gyrus (BA9), left cingulate gyrus (BA24), left culmen and pyramid of cerebellum, and right cerebellar tonsil of cerebellum in Group A. Compared with Group C, glucose metabolism increased in bilateral superior frontal gyrus (BA6, BA9, BA10), bilateral middle frontal gyrus (BA6, BA10), left middle frontal gyrus (BA4), bilateral uncus of limbic lobe (BA36, BA38), left cingulate gyrus (BA24, BA31), left posterior cingulate gyrus (BA30), left precuneus (BA7), left inferior parietal lobule (BA4), and left lingual gyrus of occipital lobe (BA18) in Group B. Compared with Group B, glucose metabolism increased in bilateral superior temporal gyrus (BA22, BA38), right inferior frontal gyrus (BA47), left culmen and cerebellar tonsil of cerebellum in Group A. Activated encephalic regions of needling at Waiguan (SJ5) were mainly dominated in the healthy side, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus. Activated encephalic regions of cerebellum were located at the left cerebellar hemisphere, left culmen of anterior cerebella lobe, and bilateral cerebellar tonsil of posterior cerebella lobe. CONCLUSIONS: Needling at Waiguan (SJ5) of CI patients induced increased glucose metabolism in local cerebral regions. Functional neuroimaging using PET/CT could directly reflect changes of brain glucose metabolism by acupuncture.

24036516|t|Identification of multiple ingredients for a Traditional Chinese Medicine preparation (bu-yang-huan-wu-tang) by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.
24036516|a|Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang (BYHWT) is a popular Traditional Chinese Medicine formula consisting of seven herbal medicines (Astragalus membranaceus, Angelica sinensis, Paeonia lactiflora, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Carthamus tinctorius, Amygdalus persica and Pheretima aspergillum), that has been used in China for centuries to overcome stroke-induced disability. To ensure the consistency of quality, a reliable analytical method is required, therefore, we developed a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for quantitative analysis of the major constituents in BYHWT. The herbal ingredients consisting of the cycloartane-type triterpene glycosides of astragaloside I, astragaloside II and astragaloside IV; isoflavones of formononetin, ononin calycosin, calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside; ligustilide and paeoniflorin were separated on a C18 column with gradient elution of methanol/10 mM ammonium acetate buffer-formic acid (100:0.1, v/v). This study was performed by a mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization (ESI) with positive ionization ions monitored in the multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. The linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were validated for this quantification method, and the sensitivity, reliability and reproducibility were all confirmed. The experiments provided a good method for analyzing BYHWT extracts. This study also quantitated the active components in various brands of commercially available products. The results indicated that the pharmaceutical industrial products of BYHWT exhibited considerable variation in their contents of the herbal compounds.

23884173|t|A cocaine-regulated and amphetamine-regulated transcript inhibits oxidative stress in neurons deprived of oxygen and glucose.
23884173|a|Stroke, of which about 87% is ischemic stroke, constitutes one of the main causes of morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. Ischemic brain injury has complex pathological mechanisms. Considerable evidence has been collected over the last few years suggesting that oxidative stress associated with excessive production of reactive oxygen species is a fundamental mechanism of brain damage in stroke and reperfusion after stroke. Oxidative stress is an important trigger of neuronal apoptosis in ischemic stroke. In this current study, it was found that cocaine-regulated and amphetamine-regulated transcript 55-102 (CART55-102) inhibited oxygen-induced and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. The peak dose of CART55-102 was 0.4 nmol/l. In addition, the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species was decreased in OGD-treated neurons in the presence of 0.4 nmol/l CART55-102. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and mtDNA mRNA expressions were increased in OGD-treated neurons in the presence of 0.4 nmol/l CART55-102. The current study suggests that CART55-102, by inhibiting oxidative stress, may be developed into therapeutic agents for ischemic stroke.

25206549|t|Pain management of hemiplegic shoulder pain post stroke in patients from Nanjing, China.
25206549|a|We selected 106 hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain hospitalized after stroke from three hospitals in Nanjing, China between February 2007 and January 2012. All patients had complete clinical data sets and accounted for 45.5% of the inpatients because of stroke. Results showed that the number of patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain post stroke increased yearly, attacking mainly males 50-69 years of age. Of 106 patients, there were 60 cases (56.6%) of adhesive capsulitis, 19 (17.9%) of shoulder subluxation, 14 (13.2%) of complex regional pain syndrome, and 13 (12.6%) of central pain. The main symptoms were shoulder pain (100%), limit of shoulder mobility (98.1%), and adhesion of the scapula (56.6%). MRI of the shoulder showed tendon and ligament lesions (57.1%) and rotator cuff tear (38.1%). 53.8% of central pain was related to the thalamus, in addition to the basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellopontine angle. Shoulder pain, upper limb motor function, and function independence were significantly improved after comprehensive rehabilitation. In particular, electroacupuncture based on basic physical therapy exhibited efficacy on shoulder tion and complex regional pain syndrome. Multiple linear regression results showed a negative relationship of efficacy of pain management with the attack period of shoulder pain, involvement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and duration between onset and rehabilitation treatment, but a positive correlation with pain-related education, pain regression period, and pain diagnosis.

25206543|t|Buyang Huanwu Decoction regulates neural stem cell behavior in ischemic brain.
25206543|a|The traditional Chinese medicine Buyang Huanwu Decoction has been shown to improve the neu-rological function of patients with stroke. However, the precise mechanisms underlying its effect remain poorly understood. In this study, we established a rat model of cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion and intragastrically administered 5 g/kg Buyang Huanwu Decoction, once per day, for 1, 7, 14 and 28 days after cerebral ischemia. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a number of cells positive for the neural stem cell marker nestin in the cerebral cortex, the subven-tricular zone and the ipsilateral hippocampal dentate gyrus in rat models of cerebral ischemia. Buyang Huanwu Decoction significantly increased the number of cells positive for 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a cell proliferation-related marker, microtubule-associated protein-2, a marker of neuronal differentiation, and growth-associated protein 43, a marker of synaptic plasticity in the ischemic rat cerebral regions. The number of positive cells peaked at 14 and 28 days after intragastric administration of Buyang Huanwu Decoction. These findings suggest that Buyang Huanwu Decoction can promote the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells and hance synaptic plasticity in ischemic rat brain tissue.

25206542|t|Salvianolate increases heat shock protein expression in a cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model.
25206542|a|Stroke remains a worldwide health problem. Salvianolate exerts a protective effect in various mi-crocirculatory disturbance-related diseases, but studies of the mechanisms underlying its protective action have mainly focused on the myocardium, whereas little research has been carried out in brain tissue following ischemia-reperfusion. We assessed the neuroprotective effects of salvianolate in a rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury induced using the suture method. At onset and 24 and 48 hours after reperfusion, rats were intraperitoneally injected with salvianolate (18 mg/kg) or saline. Neurological deficit scores at 72 hours showed that the neurological functions of rats that had received salvianolate were significantly better than those of the rats that had received saline. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride was used to stain cerebral tissue to determine the extent of the infarct area. A significantly smaller infarct area and a significantly lower number of apoptotic cells were observed after treatment with salvianolate compared with the saline treatment. Expression of heat shock protein 22 and phosphorylated protein kinase B in ischemic brain tissue was significantly greater in rats treated with salvianolate compared with rats treated with saline. Our findings suggest that salvianolate provides neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by upregulating heat shock protein 22 and phosphorylated protein kinase B expression.

24360042|t|[Effect of balloon dilatation on upper esophageal sphincter in brainstem stroke patients with dysphagia: an investigation using high-resolution solid-state manometry].
24360042|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of balloon dilation intervention on function of upper esophageal sphincter ( UES) in brainstem stroke patients with dysphagia before and after treatment by high resolution solid-state manometry. METHODS: Thirty brainstem stroke patients with pharyngeal dysphagia were recruited. The dilatation treatment group ( n = 15) completed a 3-week regimen of modified balloon dilatation and traditional swallowing including E-stim, Mendelsohn Maneuver and supraglottic swallowing. And the control group ( n = 15) only completed 3 weeks of traditional swallowing therapy. Before, and after dilatation, the nadir of UES and its duration were measured during swallowing of thin liquid, thick liquid and pasty material in 3-ml volumes. The results of both groups were compared for identical parameters. RESULTS: In the experimental group, post-treatment UES residual pressure (for water, P = 0. 008; for thick liquid,P = 0. 004 ; for paste, P = 0. 001 ) and relaxation duration ( for water, P = 0. 006 ; for thick liquid, P =0. 002; for paste, P < 0. 001 ) both significantly improved for all three materials. UES resting pressure approximated normal (Pre-treatment 30 ± 3 mm Hg; post-treatment 59 ± 6 mm Hg, P < 0. 001 ) . In the control group, there was no improvement in post-treatment UES residual pressure and relaxation duration for all three materials ( P > 0. 05). In the experimental group, feeding tube was removed in 12 /15 versus 2/15 patients in the control group. The experimental group had 3. 5 points improvement (P =0. 001) while the control group improved by a mere 0. 63 point ( P = 0. 026) in FOIS scores. CONCLUSION: Failed UES is a major cause of dysphagia in brainstem stroke patients. Dysphagia therapy with dilatation improves relaxation of UES. Moreover, it is helpful for restoring UES resting pressure. Traditional swallowing therapy has no positive effect on UES.

23822904|t|Lateralisation of cerebral response to active acupuncture in patients with unilateral ischaemic stroke: an fMRI study.
23822904|a|OBJECTIVE: Acupuncture is beneficial in treating stroke neuropsychiatric symptoms. The present study aimed to identify functional brain response to active acupuncture in patients with unilateral ischaemic stroke using functional MRI (fMRI). METHODS: A total of 10 patients aged 47-65 years with left hemispheric ischaemic stroke received single-session manual acupuncture at the TE5 point of the affected (right) forearm. A 6-min tactile control procedure in which an acupuncture needle tip was alternately touched and removed from the skin at the acupuncture point for 30 s each was performed first, followed by active acupuncture in a blocking paradigm consisting of six 30-s twist blocks of rotation interspersed between six 30-s blocks of rest. A whole brain scan was simultaneously conducted on a 3.0-T imager. Activated and deactivated brain regions during tactile stimulation and active acupuncture relative to rest were obtained via group analysis. RESULTS: Compared to tactile stimulation, needling with twist manipulation modulated many more widespread brain areas. All the brain areas activated and deactivated by active acupuncture relative to tactile stimulation were distributed in the primary sensorimotor and medial frontal cortex of the unaffected, but not the affected hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: Active acupuncture results in lateralisation of functional cerebral response to the contralateral unaffected hemisphere in patients with unilateral stroke. This lateralisation may represent an effect of acupuncture in enhancing a compensatory process by redistributing functions into the intact cortex, particularly in the unaffected hemisphere.

Danshen has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of a variety of diseases, including coronary artery disease, acute ischemic stroke, hyperlipidemia, chronic renal failure, chronic hepatitis, and Alzheimer's disease, showing no serious adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that cryptotanshinone not only possesses the potential for treatment and prevention of the above-mentioned diseases, but also is a potent anticancer agent. Here we briefly summarize the physical and chemical properties and the pharmacokinetic profiles of cryptotanshinone, and then comprehensively review its anticancer activities as well as the underlying mechanisms.

23425424|t|Does measurement of ankle-brachial index contribute to prediction of adverse health outcomes in older Chinese people?
23425424|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study examined whether ankle-brachial index (ABI) is predictive of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospital admission for stroke, ischaemic heart disease or myocardial infarction among older people aged 65 years and above, and whether the inclusion of ABI in prediction models adds any incremental value to traditional cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: Four thousand men and women living in the community aged 65 years and over were recruited. ABI was measured, and information regarding comorbidity, smoking habit, physical activity and physical limitation was obtained at baseline. Hospital admissions for stroke and ischaemic heart disease/myocardial infarction were documented after a mean period of 6.0 years and mortality after a mean of 9.1 years. RESULTS: ABI <0.9 alone was predictive of all outcomes with the exception of hospital admission for stroke. Inclusion of ABI in a model that includes other 'traditional' cardiovascular risk factors such as age; physical activity scale of the elderly; history of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and smoking; and systolic blood pressure >140/90 reduced the hazard ratios but did not alter the overall results. Comparison of prediction models with and without ABI showed little difference. When different values of ABI were examined for all outcomes, values between 0.9 and 1.0 had high specificity but low sensitivity. CONCLUSION: ABI measurement (<0.9) predicted adverse outcomes with high specificity but low sensitivity. However, it added little incremental value to prediction of adverse outcomes using traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

23793526|t|Analysis of serum metabolites for the discovery of amino acid biomarkers and the effect of galangin on cerebral ischemia.
23793526|a|Ischemic stroke, a devastating disease with a complex pathophysiology, is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. In our previous study, we reported that galangin provided direct protection against ischemic injury and acted as a potential neuroprotective agent. However, its associated neuroprotective mechanism has not yet been clarified. In this paper, we explored the potential AA biomarkers in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia and the effect of galangin on those potential biomarkers. In our study, 12 AAs were quantified in rat serum and found to be impaired by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced focal cerebral ischemia. Using partial least squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA), we identified the following amino acids as potential biomarkers of cerebral ischemia: glutamic acid (Glu), homocysteine (Hcy), methionine (Met), tryptophan (Trp), aspartic acid (Asp), alanine (Ala) and tyrosine (Tyr). Moreover, four amino acids (Hcy, Met, Glu and Trp) showed significant change in galangin-treated (100 and 50 mg kg(-1)) groups compared to vehicle groups. Furthermore, we identified three pathway-related enzymes tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), glutamine synthetase (GLUL) and monocarboxylate transporter (SLC16A10) by multiplex interactions with Glu and Hcy, which have been previously reported to be closely related to cerebral ischemia. Through an analysis of the metabolite-protein network analysis, we identified 16 proteins that were associated with two amino acids by multiple interactions with three enzymes; five of them may become potential biomarkers of galangin for acute ischemic stroke as the result of molecule docking. Our results may help develop novel strategies to explore the mechanism of cerebral ischemia, discover potential targets for drug candidates and elucidate the related regulatory signal network.

24298765|t|[Impacts of acupuncture at Jing-well points on the differentiated meridians and temple-three-needle therapy on P300 of patients with early vascular cognitive impairment].
24298765|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy on post-stroke mild cognitive impairment (MCI) treated with acupuncture at Jing-well points on the differentiated meridians and temple-three-needle therapy. METHODS: Seventy-three of stroke patients were randomized into an acupuncture group (37 cases) and a conventional treatment group (36 cases). Twenty healthy aged people in physical examination were collected as a control group. In the acupuncture group, on the basis of the conventional treatment of internal medication, the acupuncture at Jing-well points on the differentiated meridians and temple-three-needle therapy were applied. In the conventional treatment group, no any therapy was used except the conventional treatment of internal medication. In the control group, no any intervention was adopted. Neuroscan Nuamps electroencephalogram recording analysis system was used to determine the event-related potentials P300, and the amplitude and mini mental state examination (MMSE) score was observed before and after treatment in both groups. RESULTS: After treatment, in the acupuncture group, P300 latent stage was shortened, and the amplitude and the score of MMSE were increased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In the conventional treatment group, above indices were not changed obviously as compared with that before treatment (all P > 0.05). Compared with the conventional treatment group, the differences in P300 latent stage, amplitude and MMSE score were remarkable in the acupuncture group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The acupuncture at Jing-well points on the differentiated meridians and temple-three-needle therapy improves the cognitive function of the patients with MCI.

23811213|t|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decotion induced protective autophagy against the injury of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion via MAPK-mTOR signaling pathway.
23811213|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decotion (HLJDD, Hwangryun-Hae-Dok-Decotion in Japan), an ancient antipyretic and detoxifying traditional Chinese medicine formula, was reported to have protective effect on ischemic stroke. AIM OF THE RESEARCH: To investigate the therapeutic effect of HLJDD on ischemic stroke and explore its mode of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A model of ischemic stroke in the rat was established after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. Rats were assigned randomly to groups of control, sham, transient ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), and three treatment groups by HLJDD at 2.5, 5.0, 10.0mg/kg. The neurological deficit, the cerebral infarct size, morphology abnormality, biochemical parameters were examined, and the levels of relevant proteins were determined by immunoblotting analysis to evaluate the protective effects of HLJDD on ischemic stroke and explore the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: Compared with I/R group, HLJDD significantly ameliorated neurological deficit and histopathology changes, decreased infarct area, and restored the levels of biochemical indicators including nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX). HLJDD also notably elevated the levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), Beclin-1, and other autophagy related genes (Atgs), promoted the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), protein kinase B (Akt), 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1), and inhibited the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases (JNK), p38, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). CONCLUSION: HLJDD showed neuroprotective effects on ischemic stroke, at least in part to the induced protective autophagy via the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signals. This Akt-independent protective autophagy is favorable in the treatment of stroke, avoiding unfavorable side-effects associated with the inactivation of Akt. The efficacy of HLJDD on ischemic stroke and its safety warranted by its long-term clinical use in traditional Chinese medicine favored further study to develop HLJDD as an effective therapeutic agent to treat ischemic stroke.

23773826|t|Comparative pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of four alkaloids in different formulations from Corydalis decumbens.
23773826|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Corydalis decumbens, a Traditional Chinese Medicine listed in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, is clinically used for the treatment of paralytic stroke, headache, rheumatic arthritis and sciatica in China. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of protopine, tetrahydropalmatine, bicuculline, and egenine in three formulations prepared from the rhizomes of Corydalis decumbens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Alkaloid extract (CDAs-SFE) was prepared from the rhizomes of Corydalis decumbens by supercritical CO2 fluid extraction; CDAs-SFE/HPβCD (hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex), and CDAs-SFE/HCl (hydrochloride freeze-dried powder) were resulted from CDAs-SFE through complexation with HPβCD and hydrochloride, respectively. An UFLC-MS/MS method was developed for quantitative analysis of protopine, tetrahydropalmatine, bicuculline and egenine simultaneously in rat plasma after oral administration. The differences of pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the four alkaloids in three formulations were determined by pharmacokinetics analyses. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Cmax, AUC and bioavailability of protopine and tetrahydropalamatine (bioactive components) in CDAs-SFE/HCl were significantly higher than in CDAs-SFE and in CDAs-SFE/HPβCD. In contrast, in CDAs-SFE/HPβCD, AUC and bioavailability of tetrahydropalamatine were significantly lower, while those of bicuculline (toxic compound) appeared to be higher than both in CDAs-SFE and in CDAs-SFE/HCl. The results indicated that CDAs-SFE/HCl was the best beneficial formulation among the three formulations for the alkaloid extract prepared from the rhizomes of Corydalis decumbens, in which protopine and tetrahydropalamatine displayed higher bioavailability, but lower for bicuculline.

23819912|t|Effects of cordycepin on Y-maze learning task in mice.
23819912|a|Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) is the major bioactive component of Cordyceps militaris that has been widely used in oriental countries as a Traditional Chinese Medicine and healthy food for preventing early aging, improving physical performance and increasing lifespan. Cordyceps militaris extracts other than cordycepin have been reported to improve cognitive function. Although cordycepin is one of the most utilized Cordyceps militaris components, it remains unknown whether cordycepin could improve learning and memory. Here we investigated effects of cordycepin on learning and memory in healthy and ischemic mice using Y-maze test. We found that oral cordycepin administration at dose of 10 mg/kg significantly improved Y-maze learning performance both in healthy and ischemic mice. However, cordycepin at dose of 5 mg/kg enhanced Y-maze learning only in ischemic mice but not healthy mice. In this study, simultaneously, we found that orally administrated cordycepin significantly decreased the neuronal loss induced by ischemia in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. Collectively, our results can provide valuable evidence that cordycepin may act as a nootropic product or potential clinical application in improving cognitive function of patients with ischemic stroke in the future.

22610952|t|The use of repeated measures analysis of variance to study the effect of phlegm-heat syndrome on neurological deficits in patients with stroke.
22610952|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of phlegm-heat syndrome on the degree of neurological deficit and provide some data support for the correct recognition of the relationship between phlegm-heat syndrome and neurological deficits in stroke patients. METHODS: Clinical information were collected on 294 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) whose syndrome and National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score were checked at baseline (within the first 3-day admission) and at 7, 14, 28, and 90 days after admission to our clinical research centre. We explored the effect of phlegm-heat syndrome on the degree of neurological deficit following stroke by applying a repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Stroke patients with phlegm-heat syndrome had higher NIHSS score than patients without the syndrome (P <0.01), and there appeared to be a decrease in NIHSS score over time in all patients (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Phlegm-heat syndrome in patients who have suffered stroke has an effect on the degree of neurological deficiency. Disappearance of phlegm-heat syndrome may improve the degree of neurological deficit observed in stroke patients.

22539199|t|Evaluation of the conjoint efficacy in Chinese medicine with the longitudinal latent variable linear mixed model.
22539199|a|Chinese medicine (CM) clinical efficacy evaluation research involves the longitudinal multivariate measurement which means that patients are measured repeatedly and each patient is measured by several indicators on each fixed cross-section. Although each indicator can be evaluated separately with a longitudinal linear mixed model, it is important to consider all the endpoints together especially when researchers pay special attention to the change of the conjoint efficacy for several indicators in one patient. In this article, we introduce a latent variable linear mixed model to the CM conjoint efficacy evaluation and discuss why and how to analyze the longitudinal multivariate endpoint data in the clinical CM efficacy evaluation research. It may lead to the new insight of using such methodology in the field of conjoint efficacy evaluating of CM study. And with the definition of syndrome and symptom in the CM theory, the applied discussion brings the insight of CM syndrome evaluating in future. We illustrate this methodology using an example of CM efficacy evaluation from an ischemic stroke research.

23509968|t|Muscle hypertonia after permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats: a qualitative and quantitative behavioral and electrophysiological study.
23509968|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine the level of peripheral muscle resistance after cerebral ischemia. METHODS: A total of 326 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the present experiments. We used a modified method to establish peripheral muscle resistance in rat model of stroke, and qualified the recovery of motor functional deficits by behavioral measures and quantified the level of peripheral muscle resistance by electrophysiological test. RESULTS: Neurological score started to go up from day 0, achieved its peak on day 3 (1.49 ± 0.56) and kept at a high level within 10 days after surgery. Compared with 1 day before surgery, both the turn score in corner test and asymmetry score in cylinder test were increased significantly on day 3, day 6 and day 9 after surgery (p < 0.01). On day 6 and day 9 after surgery, the Hmax:Mmax ratio of hemiplegic side of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats was obviously higher than the same side in healthy rat (p < 0.01) and the ratio on the contralateral side of MCAO rats (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a progressive increase in peripheral muscle resistance on day 6 to day 9 after surgery in a rat model of postischemic stroke.

23600945|t|Fire-heat and Qi deficiency syndromes as predictors of short-term prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.
23600945|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationships between traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes and disease severity and prognoses after ischemic stroke, such as neurologic deficits and decline in activities of daily living (ADLs). METHODS: The study included 211 patients who met the inclusion criteria of acute ischemic stroke based on clinical manifestations, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging findings, and onset of ischemic stroke within 72 hours with clear consciousness. To assess neurologic function and ADLs in patients with different TCM syndromes, the TCM Syndrome Differentiation Diagnostic Criteria for Apoplexy scale (containing assessments of wind, phlegm, blood stasis, fire-heat, qi deficiency, and yin deficiency with yang hyperactivity syndromes) was used within 72 hours of stroke onset, and Western medicine-based National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Barthel Index (BI) assessments were performed at both admission and discharge. RESULTS: The most frequent TCM syndromes associated with acute ischemic stroke were wind syndrome, phlegm syndrome, and blood stasis syndrome. Improvement according to the BI at discharge and days of admission were significantly different between patients with and those without fire-heat syndrome. Patients with qi deficiency syndrome had longer hospital stays and worse NIHSS and BI assessments at discharge than patients without qi deficiency syndrome. All the reported differences reached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that fire-heat syndrome and qi deficiency syndrome are essential elements that can predict short-term prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.

23780952|t|Chinese medicine neuroaid efficacy on stroke recovery: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study.
23780952|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous clinical studies suggested benefit for poststroke recovery when MLC601 was administered between 2 weeks and 6 months of stroke onset. The Chinese Medicine Neuroaid Efficacy on Stroke recovery (CHIMES) study tested the hypothesis that MLC601 is superior to placebo in acute, moderately severe ischemic stroke within a 72-hour time window. METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized 1100 patients with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 6 to 14, within 72 hours of onset, to trial medications for 3 months. The primary outcome was a shift in the modified Rankin Scale. Secondary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale dichotomy, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement, difference in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale total and motor scores, Barthel index, and mini-mental state examination. Planned subgroup analyses were performed according to age, sex, time to first dose, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, presence of cortical signs, and antiplatelet use. RESULTS: The modified Rankin Scale shift analysis-adjusted odds ratio was 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.32). Statistical difference was not detected between the treatment groups for any of the secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed no statistical heterogeneity for the primary outcome; however, a trend toward benefit in the subgroup receiving treatment beyond 48 hours from stroke onset was noted. Serious and nonserious adverse events rates were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: MLC601 is statistically no better than placebo in improving outcomes at 3 months when used among patients with acute ischemic stroke of intermediate severity. Longer treatment duration and follow-up of participants with treatment initiated after 48 hours may be considered in future studies. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

23628154|t|Novel pharmacokinetic studies of the Chinese formula Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang in MCAO rats.
23628154|a|Our previous studies showed that after oral administration of an Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT) decoction, there is a higher concentration of the pure components, berberine, baicalin and gardenoside in the plasma of Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats than in sham-operated rats, The aim of the present study was to determine whether these components could be reliably measured in MCAO rat tissues. First, the plasma concentration-time profiles of berberine, palmatine, baicalin, baicalein and gardenoside were characterised in MCAO rats after oral administration of the aqueous extract of HLJDT. Subsequently, liver, lung and kidney tissues were obtained from sudden death MCAO rats in the absorption phase (0.25 h), the distribution phase (1.0 h) and the elimination phase (8.0 h) after administration of the HLJDT aqueous extract. An HPLC method was developed and validated for the determination of the distribution characteristics of berberine, palmatine, baicalin, baicalein and gardenoside simultaneously from the above-mentioned rat tissues. The results indicated that berberine, palmatine, baicalin and baicalein distributed rapidly and accumulated at high levels in the lung, while gardenoside distributed widely in the lung and the kidney. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the distribution of the active ingredients derived from HLJDT in MCAO rat tissues. The tissue distribution results provide a biopharmaceutical basis for the design of the clinic application of HLJDT in cerebrovascular disease.

23707212|t|The protective role of Tongxinluo on blood-brain barrier after ischemia-reperfusion brain injury.
23707212|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tongxinluo (TXL), a renowned traditional Chinese medicine, consists of several different kinds of ingredients and has been widely used to treat myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. However, the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms are not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: We focus on the effect of TXL on blood-brain barrier (BBB) including edema formation and tight junction (TJ) protein rearrangement, and inflammatory response after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). We further explore the protective mechanism of TXL on ischemia-induced BBB damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult CD1 male mice (n=168) were randomly divided into TXL pre-treatment group, TXL pre-post treatment group, TXL post-treatment group, control group and sham group. Mice in TXL pre-treatment group were given TXL solution by 1g/kg/day orally for 7 days before tMCAO. Mice in pre-post treatment group were continuously given TXL 7 days before and 14 days after tMCAO. Mice in TXL post-treatment group were given TXL solution immediately after tMCAO. Rotarod test and neurological severity scores were evaluated at 1-14 days following tMCAO. Brains were harvested for examining infarct volume, edema formation, and immunofluorescent staining at 1 and 3 days after tMCAO. Cytokines IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA expression, and BBB permeability were further examined by RT-PCR and immunostaining. RESULTS: TXL pre-post treatment improved neurobehavioral outcomes and reduced infarct volume compared to the control (p<0.05). Meanwhile, hemispheric swelling, Evans blue and IgG protein extravasation reduced, while TJ protein expression up-regulated in pre-post treatment group (p<0.05). Further study indicated that infarct volume was smaller and BBB damage was less severe in TXL pre-post treatment group compared to TXL pre-treatment alone. It was noted that fewer myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive cells and less cytokines IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α expression in pre-post treatment group compared to the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: TXL pre-treatment and pre-post treatment effectively protected the brain from BBB disruption via alleviating inflammatory response. Moreover, pre-post treatment has better outcomes, suggesting that continuous administration of TXL before and throughout ischemia period is necessary because of multiple functions of TXL.

25206473|t|The effects of Xingnao Jieyu capsules on post-stroke depression are similar to those of fluoxetine.
25206473|a|The Xingnao Jieyu capsule has been shown to effectively relieve neurologic impairments and lessen depression. It remains poorly understood whether this capsule can be used to treat post-stroke depression. Thus, in the present study, we established a rat model of post-stroke depression using left middle cerebral artery occlusions in combination of chronic unpredictable stress and solitary housing during development. Experimental rats received intragastric perfusion with 0.82, 0.41, and 0.20 g/kg Xingnao Jieyu capsules separately dissolved in 2 mL distilled water. Fluoxetine served as a positive control. The treatment was conducted over 28 days. Sugar water consumption test, open-field test, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining results demonstrated that intragastric perfusion with various doses of Xingnao Jieyu capsules increased sugar water consumption, voluntary behaviors and synaptotagmin mRNA and protein expression in rats with post-stroke depression. These therapeutic effects were similar to those of fluoxetine. These results indicate that Xingnao Jieyu capsules upregulate synaptotagmin expression in hippocampi of rats with post-stroke depression, and exert antidepressant effects.

24101845|t|Opinions about the use of the recognition of stroke in the emergency room scale.
23906101|t|Relationship between Chinese medicine pattern types, clinical severity, and prognosis in patients with acute cerebral infarct.
23906101|a|We investigated the relationship between Chinese medicine pattern (CMP) types, their severity, and prognosis in patients (n = 187) with acute cerebral infarct (ACI). Six CMPs (wind, phlegm, fire-heat, blood stasis, qi deficiency, and yin deficiency and yang hyperactivity) were evaluated according to inspection, listening and smelling, inquiry, and palpitation. The severity and prognosis of each pattern type was determined according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM), recorded at stroke onset and 12 weeks after stroke onset. The phlegm pattern (PP) patients displayed lower GCS, BI, and FIM scales scores, and higher MRS and NIHSS scales scores, than the nonphlegm pattern (N-PP) patients at, and 12 weeks after stroke onset, suggesting the clinical severity is greater and the prognosis is worse in PP patients with ACI than in non-PP patients with ACI.

23875903|t|Ethanol extract of Lycopus lucidus elicits positive inotropic effect via activation of Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ release in beating rabbit atria.
23875903|a|Lycopus lucidus Turcz has been widely used as a traditional Oriental medicine (TOM) in Korea and China and prescribed for the enhancement of heart function. However, the precise effects have yet to be defined. The purpose of the present study was, therefore, to address whether the ethanol extract of Lycopus lucidus Turcz (ELT) has a positive inotropic effect. ELT-induced changes in atrial mechanical dynamics (pulse pressure, dp/dt, and stroke volume), and cAMP efflux were measured in perfused beating rabbit atria. Three active components, rosmarinic acid, betulinic acid, and oleanolic acid were identified in ELT by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. ELT increased atrial dynamics in a concentration-dependent manner without changes in atrial cAMP levels and cAMP efflux. The ELT-induced positive inotropic effect was blocked by inhibition of the L-type Ca(2+) channels and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Inhibitors of β-adrenoceptors had no effect on the ELT-induced positive inotropic effect. The results suggest that ELT exerts a positive inotropic effect via activation of Ca(2+) entry through L-type Ca(2+) channel and Ca(2+) release from the SR in beating rabbit atria.

24417149|t|[Effects of shuang shen tong guan decoction on the blood flow dynamics in rat model with myocardial infarction].
24417149|a|OBJECTIVE: To research the effects of Shuang Shen Tong Guan Decoction (SSTGD) on hemodynamics in rats with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: SD rats were divided into sham operation group,model group, SSTGD low-dose group (2.5 g/kg), SSTGD middle-dose group (5 g/kg) and SSTGD high-dose group (7.5 g/kg). The levels of HR, MAP, LVSP, LVEDP, LVdp/ dt(max) and LVdp/dt(min) were detected by PowerLab at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after administration. RESULTS: Compared with the sham operated group, the levels of HR, MAP were increased, the levels of LVSP, LVEDP, LVdp/dt(max) and LVdp/dt(min) were reduced at each detected point in model group, the difference was significant (P < 0.05). Compared with the model group, HR and MAP were decreased in SSTGD low-dose group, SSTGD middle-dose group and SSTGD high-dose group after 15 min; LVSP, LVEDP, LVdp/dt(max) and LVdp/dt(min) were higher, there was significantly difference (P < 0.05). Compared with SSTGD low-dose group and SSTGD middle-dose group, the difference of LVSP, LVEDP, LVdp/dt(max) and LVdp/dt(min) was statistically significant in SSTGD high-dose group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SSTGD can improve cardiac function by increasing heart stroke volume, decreasing cardiac oxygen consumption and total peripheral vascular resistance.

24063204|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Tongguan Capsule (TC) on the number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the peripheral blood of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: Recruited were 60 CAD patients undergoing PCI who were admitted and treated at ICU and the Heart Center of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from March to October 2010. They were assigned to the treatment group (treated by TC) and the control group (treated by placebos) according to the random digit table, 30 cases in each group. They took TC or placebos from the day of PCI, three pills each time, three times a day, for three consecutive months. The numbers of peripheral blood CD34 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) positive cells were detected before PCI and 3 months after PCI respectively. The echocardiography was performed before PCI and 3 months after PCI respectively to determinate the left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The wall motion score index (WMSI) was assessed in the two groups. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the number of EPCs, LVEF,WMSI, or SV in the two groups before PCI (P > 0.05). The number of EPCs increased in both the two groups after 1 month of PCI (P < 0.05). It was obviously higher in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The LVEF both increased in the two groups 3 months after PCI (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The WMSI decreased and SV increased in the treatment group (P < 0.05). The improvement of LVEF and WMSI was better in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: TC could up-regulate the number of EPCs in the peripheral blood of CAD patients after PCI, and improve their cardiac functions.

24199584|t|[Summary of Hui prescriptions for stroke].
24199584|a|Current Hui prescriptions are mostly recorded in the Arabic language. Their fussy and inconsistent names (Arabic names) result in the restriction in the clinical application of Hui prescriptions. Having collected and screened out 101 Hui prescriptions for stroke, the author further studied some of their names in literatures, in order to facilitate clinical application of these prescriptions (i. e. unification of their Arabic and Chinese names, and textual research of identical drugs with different Arabic names). This lays a foundation for the clinical application of Hui prescriptions and the analysis on compatibility regulatory, and provides scientific basis for studies on new Hui medicines.

24199581|t|[Effect of early intervention of liver-smoothing and blood-activating decoction combined with acupuncture on patients with post-stroke depression].
24199581|a|To study the effect of early intervention of liver-soothing and Blood-activating decoction combined with acupuncture in improving neurological functions, depressive symptom and life quality of patients with post-stroke depression, and compare with fluoxetine hydrochloride. Specifically, 63 patients with post-stroke depression were randomly divided into the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) acupuncture group (31 cases) and the western medicine group (32 cases). On the basis of the conventional treatment of the primary disease, the TCM acupuncture group was treated with liver-soothing and blood-activating decoction and acupuncture, while the western medicine group was treated with fluoxetine hydrochloride for four weeks. In the follow-up visit six months later, scores of HAMD, NIHSS and SS-QOL were observed. The scores of HAMD and NIHSS of both groups were significantly decreased (P < 0.01), while the scores of SS-QOL increased significantly, with a notable difference compared with that before the treatment (P < 0.01). Specifically, the TCM acupuncture group's was superior to the western medicine group (P < 0.05). The study suggests that the early intervention of liver-soothing and blood-activating decoction combined with acupuncture on patients with post-stroke depression has the effect in relieving depression symptom and improving neurological functions, thereby improving their quality of life and prognosis.

25206465|t|A meta-analysis of Chinese herbal medicines for vascular dementia.
25206465|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of patients with vascular dementia. DATA RETRIEVAL: We retrieved publications from Cochrane Library (2004 to July 2011), PubMed (1966 to July 2011), the Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (1977 to July 2011), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1979 to July 2011), Google Scholar (July 2011), and the Chinese Biomedical Database (1977 to July 2011) using the key words "Chinese medicine OR Chinese herbal medicine" and "vascular dementia OR mild cognition impair OR multi-infarct dementia OR small-vessel dementia OR strategic infarct dementia OR hypoperfusion dementia OR hemorrhagic dementia OR hereditary vascular dementia". SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing Chinese herbal medicines with placebo/western medicine in the treatment of patients with vascular dementia were included. Diagnostic standards included Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association Internationale pour la Recherché et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences. Two participants independently conducted literature screening, quality evaluation and data extraction. The quality of each trial was assessed according to the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook 5.0. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effective rate, Mini-Mental State Examination scores, Hasegawa Dementia Scale scores, and incidence of adverse reactions. RESULTS: We identified 1 143 articles discussing the effects of Chinese medicine on vascular dementia. Thirty-one of these were included in the analysis. These studies involved a total of 2 868 participants (1 605 patients took Chinese medicine decoctions (treatment group); 1 263 patients took western medicine or placebo). The results of our meta-analysis revealed that Chinese herbal remedies in the treatment group were more efficacious than the control intervention (relative risk (RR) = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-1.38, P < 0.01). Mini-Mental State Examination scores were higher in patients taking Chinese herbal medicines than in those in the control group (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 2.83; 95%CI: 2.55-3.12, P < 0.01). Patients in the treatment group showed better disease amelioration than those in the control group (Hasegawa Dementia Scale scores; WMD = 2.41, 95%CI: 1.48-3.34, P < 0.01). There were also considerably fewer adverse reactions among those in the treatment group compared with those in the control group (RR = 0.20, 95%CI: 0.08-0.47, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Chinese herbal medicine appears to be safer and more effective than control measures in the treatment of vascular dementia. However, the included trials were generally low in quality. More well-designed, high-quality trials are needed to provide better evidence for the assessment of the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicines for vascular dementia.

25206460|t|Paeonol attenuates inflammation-mediated neurotoxicity and microglial activation.
25206460|a|Chronic activation of microglial cells endangers neuronal survival through the release of various proinflammatory and neurotoxic factors. The root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall has been considered useful for the treatment of various disorders in traditional oriental medicine. Paeonol, found in the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall, has a wide range of pharmacological functions, including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of paeonol in the repression of inflammation-induced neurotoxicity and microglial cell activation. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures and primary microglial cells from rat brain were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Paeonol pretreatment was performed for 30 minutes prior to lipopolysaccharide addition. Cell viability and nitrite (the production of nitric oxide), tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta products were measured after lipopolysaccharide treatment. In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, paeonol blocked lipopolysaccharide-related hippocampal cell death and inhibited the release of nitrite and interleukin-1beta. Paeonol was effective in inhibiting nitric oxide release from primary microglial cells. It also reduced the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1β from microglial cells. Paeonol possesses neuroprotective activity in a model of inflammation-induced neurotoxicity and reduces the release of neurotoxic and proinflammatory factors in activated microglial cells.

23583540|t|Xiaoxuming decoction for acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
23583540|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiaoxuming decoction (XXMD) is a well-known traditional Chinese herbal prescription in treatment of patients with stroke. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of XXMD for acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in 6 databases until June 2012 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of XXMD for acute ischemic stroke compared with western conventional medicine (WCM). The primary outcome measures were National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. The secondary outcome measures were the clinical effective rate and adverse events at the end of treatment course. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed independently using 12-item criteria according to the Cochrane Back Review Group. All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.0 software. RESULTS: Eight RCTs with 601 individuals published from 1992 to 2012 were identified. The studies were deemed to have a high risk of bias. Compared with WCM, 1 RCT showed significant effects of XXMD for improving mRS after stroke (p<0.05); 3 RCTs for improving NIHSS scores [n=186, weighted mean difference (WMD): -1.86, 95% CI: -3.25 to -0.48, z=2.63, p<0.01]; 7 RCTs for improving the clinical effective rate [n=531, risk ratio (RR)=1.17, 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.26, z=4.38, p<0.01]. Five trials contained safety assessments and stated that no adverse event was found, whereas the other 3 trials did not provide the information about adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed positive but weak evidence of XXMD for acute ischemic stroke because of the poor methodological quality and the small quantity of the included trials. The difficulties of fitting Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) into the double blinded RCTs have raised as follows: (A) traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as whole systems of healthcare offers unique methodological and theoretical challenges for RCTs; (B) suspicions against the placebo and unwillingness to stop taking other CHMs make recruitment more difficulty, time-consumption, and cost; (C) the shortcomings of the TCM diagnostic process includes the lack of standardization in terminology, disagreement of pattern differentiation (Bianzheng), and neglect of formula corresponding to syndrome (TCM Zheng); (D) It is difficult to design credible herbal placebos with similar appearance, smells and tastes to the experimental CHM and at the same time is absent of any pharmacological activity; (E) the achieving efficacy of CHM complex interventions is often nonspecific and the outcome measures is subjective using Chinese quantitative instrument.

23777875|t|A systematic review of anti-obesity medicinal plants - an update.
23777875|a|Obesity is the most prevalent health problem affecting all age groups, and leads to many complications in the form of chronic heart disease, diabetes mellitus Type 2 and stroke. A systematic review about safety and efficacy of herbal medicines in the management of obesity in human was carried out by searching bibliographic data bases such as, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and IranMedex, for studies reported between 30th December 2008 to 23rd April 2012 on human or animals, investigating the beneficial and harmful effects of herbal medicine to treat obesity. Actually we limited our search to such a narrow window of time in order to update our article published before December of 2008. In this update, the search terms were "obesity" and ("herbal medicine" or "plant", "plant medicinal" or "medicine traditional") without narrowing or limiting search items. Publications with available abstracts were reviewed only. Total publications found in the initial search were 651. Total number of publications for review study was 33 by excluding publications related to animals study.Studies with Nigella Sativa, Camellia Sinensis, Crocus Sativus L, Seaweed laminaria Digitata, Xantigen, virgin olive oil, Catechin enriched green tea, Monoselect Camellia, Oolong tea, Yacon syrup, Irvingia Gabonensi, Weighlevel, RCM-104 compound of Camellia Sinensis, Pistachio, Psyllium fibre, black Chinese tea, sea buckthorn and bilberries show significant decreases in body weight. Only, alginate-based brown seaweed and Laminaria Digitata caused an abdominal bloating and upper respiratory tract infection as the side effect in the trial group. No other significant adverse effects were reported in all 33 trials included in this article.In conclusion, Nigella Sativa, Camellia Synensis, Green Tea, and Black Chinese Tea seem to have satisfactory anti-obesity effects. The effect size of these medicinal plants is a critical point that should be considered for interpretation. Although there was no report for side effect in these trials, we believe that safety of these plants still remains to be elucidated by further long-term studies.

23837037|t|Electroacupuncture at Quchi and Zusanli treats cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury through activation of ERK signaling.
23837037|a|The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, a critical mediator of cell proliferation, is activated in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and is therefore a key target in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Acupuncture has long been used in China to clinically treat stroke. However, the precise mechanism of its neuroprotective activities remains largely unknown. In the present study, a focal cerebral I/R-injured rat model was used to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. EA significantly ameliorated neurological deficits and cerebral infarction in cerebral I/R-injured rats. Moreover, EA significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK, as well as the protein expression levels of Ras, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4. Consequently, EA-mediated activation of the ERK pathway resulted in the stimulation of cerebral cell proliferation. The present data suggest that EA at the Quchi and Zusanli acupoints exerts a neuroprotective effect in ischemic stroke via the activation of ERK signaling.

23563488|t|Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction suppresses LPS-induced activation of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway in BV-2 murine microglial cells.
23563488|a|Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling-mediated neuroinflammation contributes to secondary brain damage in ischemic stroke; therefore, anti-inflammatory therapy via suppression of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway could be a promising strategy for the treatment of stroke and post-stroke disabilities. Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction (GLGZD) has long been used in China to clinically treat dysfunction after stroke such as muscular spasticity, but the precise mechanisms are largely unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of GLGZD and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells as an in vitro inflammatory model of neural cells. We found that GLGZD inhibited the inflammatory response in microglial cells as it significantly reduced LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory nitric oxide, tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in BV-2 cells, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, GLGZD treatment significantly decreased the protein expression of TLR4 and myeloid differentiation factor 88, inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB and blocked the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in BV-2 cells, demonstrating its inhibitory effect on the activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling. Collectively, our findings suggest that inhibition of the inflammatory response via suppression of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway may be one of the mechanisms through which GLGZD ameliorates the damage in ischemic cerebral tissues.

25206438|t|Research progress in rehabilitation treatment of stroke patients: A bibliometric analysis.
25206438|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke presents as a transient or chronic brain dysfunction and is associated with high morbidity and high mortality. The doctors and scientists would like to argue how to enhance the validity of the rehabilitation treatment and how to further improve the level of treatment on stroke. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantitatively analyze the current worldwide progress in research on stroke rehabilitation treatment based on Web of Science database and ClinicalTrial.gov in the past 10 years. METHODS: We conducted a quantitative analysis of clinical trial articles regarding stroke rehabilitation published in English from 2003 to 2013 and indexed in the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials registry and Web of Science databases. Data were downloaded on March 15, 2013. RESULTS: (1) From 2003 to 2013, 2 654 clinical trials investigating stroke were indexed in ClinicalTrials.gov. There were only 58 clinical trials registered in 2003, and there was a marked increase from 2005. A total of 605 clinical trials on the rehabilitation of stroke were conducted in the past 10 years. (2) The analysis showed that most of the trials in the field were registered by North American institutions. With respect to the Asian countries, China and Taiwan area of China also published a reasonable proportion of the trials, but comparatively speaking, the number of trials is really rare. Most of the interventions were drugs, followed by the devices, and behavioral interventions were ranked third. (3) In the past 10 years, there were 4 052 studies on stroke indexed by Web of Science database. CONCLUSION: From perspective of research progress, we found that the number of clinical trials and papers on stroke rehabilitation has increased significantly in the past 10 years, between them a remarkable positive correlation exists.

25206433|t|Gastrodin promotes the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the injured spinal cord.
25206433|a|Gastrodin, an active component of tall gastrodia tuber, is widely used in the treatment of dizziness, paralysis, epilepsy, stroke and dementia, and exhibits a neuroprotective effect. A rat model of spinal cord injury was established using Allen's method, and gastrodin was administered via the subarachnoid cavity and by intraperitoneal injection for 7 days. Results show that gastrodin promoted the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in rats with spinal cord injury. After gastrodin treatment, the maximum angle of the inclined plane test, and the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scores increased. Moreover, gastrodin improved neural tissue recovery in the injured spinal cord. These results demonstrate that gastrodin promotes the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, contributes to the recovery of neurological function, and protects neural cells against injury.

24146522|t|Specific neuroprotective effects of manual stimulation of real acupoints versus non-acupoints in rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion.
24146522|a|The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and specific effects of acupuncture on ischemic-induced damage in rats after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in male Wistar rats. The rats were divided into the following 4 groups: normal controls, ischemic, real acupuncture-treated (Shuigou, DU26), and non-acupoint-treated groups. On the third postoperative day, neurological deficit scores, cerebral blood flow, infarction volume, and neuronal cell death counts were measured. In the real acupuncture-treated group, the neurological deficit scores and cerebral blood flow were improved (p < 0.05) and the infarction volume and neuronal cell death counts were reduced (p < 0.01) compared to the ischemic and non-acupoint-treated groups. The present study demonstrated that real acupuncture was effective against focal ischemia-induced damage in rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and the effects were specifically related to the right needling location.

23672353|t|Clinical assessment of complementary treatment with Qishen Yiqi dripping pills on ischemic heart failure: study protocol for a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (CACT-IHF).
23672353|a|BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is associated with decreased quality of life, high re-admission rate and poor prognosis. In particular, ischemic heart failure (IHF) has a worse prognosis than nonischemic HF. The use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) alongside Western medicine to treat HF has developed into an integrative treatment model in China. There have been small clinical trials and experimental studies to demonstrate the efficacy of TCM for treating HF; however, there is still a lack of high-quality trials. Qishen Yiqi dripping pills (QSYQ), a TCM drug, have been commonly used alongside standardized Western medicine to treat IHF. This paper describes the protocol for the clinical assessment of QSYQ in IHF patients. METHOD: A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial will assess the efficacy and safety of QSYQ in the treatment of IHF. The trial is to enroll 640 IHF patients from 32 hospitals in China. Besides their standardized Western medicine, patients will be randomized to receive treatment of either QSYQ or placebo for 6 months and follow-up monitoring for at least a further 6 months. The primary outcome is increased exercise capacity of patients, which will be measured using the 6-minute walking test (6MWT). The secondary outcomes include composite endpoints: all-cause mortality, frequency of hospitalization or emergency due to cardiovascular events, brain natriuretic peptide levels, left ventricular ejection fraction, and cardiothoracic ratio will be documented, as well as scores on the New York Heart Association classification and Minnesota quality of life index, and information obtained from the four TCM diagnostic methods. Blood lipid tests will also be administered. DISCUSSION: The integrative treatment model of TCM alongside Western medicine has developed into a treatment model in China. The rigorous design of the trial will assure an objective and scientific assessment of the efficacy and safety of QSYQ in the treatment of IHF.

23525450|t|Electroacupuncture ameliorates cognitive impairment through inhibition of NF-κB-mediated neuronal cell apoptosis in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injured rats.
23525450|a|Cognitive impairment is a serious mental deficit following stroke that severely affects the quality of life of stroke survivors. Nuclear factor‑κB (NF-κB)-mediated neuronal cell apoptosis is involved in the development of post-stroke cognitive impairment; therefore, it has become a promising target for the treatment of impaired cognition. Acupuncture at the Baihui (DU20) and Shenting (DU24) acupoints is commonly used in China to clinically treat post‑stroke cognitive impairment; however, the precise mechanism of its action is largely unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of electroacupuncture against post-stroke cognitive impairment and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms using a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Electroacupuncture at Baihui and Shenting was identified to significantly ameliorate neurological deficits and reduce cerebral infarct volume. Additionally, electroacupuncture improved learning and memory ability in cerebral I/R injured rats, demonstrating its therapeutic efficacy against post-stroke cognitive impairment. Furthermore, electroacupuncture significantly suppressed the I/R-induced activation of NF-κB signaling in ischemic cerebral tissues. The inhibitory effect of electroacupuncture on NF-κB activation led to the inhibition of cerebral cell apoptosis. Finally, electroacupuncture markedly downregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and Fas, two critical downstream target genes of the NF-κB pathway. Collectively, our findings suggest that inhibition of NF-κB‑mediated neuronal cell apoptosis may be one mechanism via which electroacupuncture at Baihui and Shenting exerts a therapeutic effect on post-stroke cognitive impairment.

23947126|t|[Comparative study on rat in situ nasal absorption of geniposide of Xingnaojing nasal drop and Xingnaojing microemulsion].
23947126|a|Xingnaojing (XNJ) is an effective clinical drug used to treat acute stroke. Compared with injection administration, its nasal administration has better brain targeting. Therefore, through nasal administration, XNJ microemulsion could help solve the drug load of compound components of different polarities contained in large-dose and high-concentration traditional Chinese medicines, and reduce irritation to nasal mucosa In this study, the modified volume correction method and the improved rat in situ nasal perfusion model were adopted to compare the nasal absorption of geniposide contained in different XNJ preparations. The results showed that the constant absorption rate of geniposide (GE) in XNJ-D was (2.95 +/- 0.25) x 10(-3) min(-1), whereas the constant absorption rate of GE in XNJ-M was (2.16 +/- 0.21) x 10(-3) min(-1). This indicated that the rat nasal absorption of GE in different XNJ preparations complied with the first-order process and could be considered as passive absorption. GE in XNJ-D was absorbed faster than that in XNJ-M, which provided basis for the development of nasal preparations of XNJ.

23944051|t|[Discussion on treatment of hypertension by tonifying kidney].
23944051|a|Hypertension is one of the important risk factors of chronic non-communicable diseases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and so on. It seriously affects heart, brain, kidney and other vital organs of the structure and function. In recent years, prevalence of hypertension in China is growing rapidly. The natural process of hypertension is changed directly because of constantly optimizing and widely using antihypertensive drugs, which results in the change of evolution law in traditional Chinese medicine pathology correspondingly. Kidney deficiency is the key pathology of hypertension nowadays. It is demonstrated that hypertension could be treated by the therapeutic principle of tonifying kidney.

25206407|t|Efficacy of suspended moxibustion in stroke rats is associated with a change in tail temperature.
25206407|a|Suspended moxibustion-produced heat can transfer from the acupoint to other sites of the body. The suspended moxibustion should be terminated when clinical propagated sensation disappears, because this implies that the quantity of moxibustion is sufficient. We wanted to investigate if this phenomenon also occurs in experimental animals. In the present study, a rat model of stroke was established and treated with suspended moxibustion at Dazhui (DU14) for 60 minutes. Results showed that the increase in tail temperature began at 15 minutes after suspended moxibustion and decreased gradually at 40 minutes. In addition, neurological function was significantly improved in stroke rats with tail temperature increase following suspended moxibustion, and this effect was associated with significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β mRNA. However, there was no significant difference between 40- and 60-minute suspended moxibustion. The findings indicate that elevated tail temperature began to decrease at 40 minutes after suspended moxibustion, and further suspended moxibustion was not useful in the recovery of stroke rats.

23370322|t|Icariin promotes histone acetylation and attenuates post-stroke cognitive impairment in the central cholinergic circuits of mice.
23370322|a|Post-stroke dementia (PSD) is a common clinical disease and the central cholinergic circuits are important to cognitive function. Icariin (ICA), a flavonoid isolated from Herba Epimedii, was reported to improve cognitive function through modulating the cholinergic system. But there were no studies exploring the role of ICA in PSD animal models. In this study, we used transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mice with cognitive dysfunction in the PSD model. PSD mice were then randomly divided into six groups: Sham-operated+placebo group, Sham-operated+ICA group (60mg/kg), PSD model+placebo group, PSD model+ICA group (30, 60, or 120mg/kg). We observed spatial learning ability and memory by Morris water maze test. The levels of acetylcholine (ACH) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the degree of histone acetylation and the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in the central cholinergic circuits were investigated by Western blot and immunofluorescence. After the administration of various doses of ICA, the escape latency and searching distance of the PSD mice were reduced significantly compared with those without ICA treatment. While the levels of ACH and ChAT declined, the degree of histone acetylation and the CREB phosphorylation was improved in a dose-dependent manner in central cholinergic circuits. In conclusion, ICA can improve post-stroke dementia, and the mechanism is likely to enhance CREB phosphorylation in the central cholinergic circuits, thus improving the damage in cholinergic circuits histone acetylation homeostasis.

23534471|t|Use of traditional Chinese medicine in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease.
23534471|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or both TCM and guideline-recommended Western medicine (WM) in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS: A cross-sectional nationwide survey of 2803 CHD outpatients was completed by collecting information, including general demographic data, disease history, and use of drugs (including TCM and WM). RESULTS: Of the 2712 CHD outpatients with complete drug treatment data, only 3.1% received TCM without any WM for CHD, 30.0% received both TCM and WM recommended by current CHD guidelines, and 66.9% received only WM. Patients with a longer history of CHD or with a history of stroke, were more likely to use TCM. However, 90.6% of CHD patients who used TCM also used certain WM. Furthermore, patients who used more types of TCM tended to use much less WM recommended by current guidelines. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of Chinese CHD outpatients use both TCM and WM for secondary prevention of CHD. It is important to assess the effect of combined TCM and WM on major clinical outcomes in Chinese CHD patients.

23443675|t|Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction exerts neuroprotective effects on post-stroke spasticity via the modulation of glutamate levels and AMPA receptor expression.
23443675|a|Spasticity is one of the most physically debilitating disabilities following stroke and may slow down the potential success of rehabilitation. Glutamate and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors have been shown to play a crucial role in spasticity following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction (GLGZD) is a well-known traditional Chinese formula that has long been used clinically in China to treat muscular spasticity following stroke, epilepsy or spinal cord injury. However, the precise mechanisms behind its neuroprotective and anti-spasticity effects remain poorly understood. In the present study, using a rat model of focal cerebral I/R injury, we evaluated the neuroprotective and anti-spasticity effects of GLGZD and investigated the underlying mechanisms. We found that GLGZD improved neurological deﬁcits and reduced infarct volumes in cerebral I/R-injured rats. In addition, GLGZD reduced cerebral ischemic spasticity since it improved the screen test and Hoffman's reflex (H-reflex) scores. It also reduced glutamate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and altered the expression of the AMPA receptor subunits. Our data demonstrate that GLGZD exerts neuroprotective and anti-spasticity effects in a cerebral ischemia model via the modulation of glutamate levels and AMPA receptor expression.

22805254|t|Effects of a nurse-led acupressure programme for stroke patients in China.
22805254|a|AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a nurse-led acupressure programme on the recovery of motor function and daily activities of stroke patients. BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the main causes of death and permanent physical disability in the world. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely used for the treatment and rehabilitation of people with stroke in China. Physiotherapy or occupational therapy cannot be performed several times a day. Therefore, researchers and healthcare providers have been seeking effective and efficient alternative strategies for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. Acupressure, non-invasive and widely accessible to any healthcare professionals, is one of the promising alternatives. METHODS: Seventy-eight stroke patients were recruited and randomly assigned into an intervention or control group, with 39 patients in each. The intervention group received acupressure plus routine care, while the control group received only routine care only. The acupressure treatment was carried out by nurses. Patient's activities of daily living (ADL) and motor function from both groups were evaluated at the point of recruitment, and at the end of the first and third month after stroke. RESULTS: The ADL and the Fugl-Meyer motor scores in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group at the end of the third month (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Nurse-led acupressure programme had positive effects on the recovery of motor function and daily activities of stroke patients. Our study suggests that nurse-led acupressure programmes play an important role in the recovery of stroke patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Healthcare providers need to think about alternative care methods including acupressure for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. Acupressure is one of the promising alternatives nursing intervention for stroke patients in practice.

25206726|t|Xueshuantong improves cerebral blood perfusion in elderly patients with lacunar infarction.
25206726|a|A total of 64 patients with acute lacunar infarction were enrolled within 24 hours of onset. The patients received conventional therapy (antiplatelet drugs and hypolipidemic drugs) alone or conventional therapy plus 450 mg Xueshuantong once a day. The main ingredient of the Xueshuantong lyophilized powder used for injection was Panax notoginseng saponins. Assessments were made at admission and at discharge using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the Activity of Daily Living and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Additionally, the relative cerebral blood flow, relative cerebral blood volume and relative mean transit time in the region of interest were calculated within 24 hours after the onset of lacunar infarction, using dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance perfusion imaging technology. Patients underwent a follow-up MRI scan after 4 weeks of treatment. There was an improvement in the Activity of Daily Living scores and a greater reduction in the scores on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale in the treatment group than in the control group. However, the Mini-Mental State Examination scores showed no significant differences after 4 weeks of treatment. Compared with the control group, the relative cerebral blood flow at discharge had increased and showed a greater improvement in the treatment group. Furthermore, there was a reduction in the relative mean transit time at discharge and the value was lower in the treatment group than in the control group. The experimental findings indicate that Xueshuantong treatment improves neurological deficits in elderly patients with lacunar infarction, and the mechanism may be related to increased cerebral perfusion.

22986613|t|The role of TNF-α 308G>A polymorphism in the risk for ischemic stroke.
22986613|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is a common health problem; however, its pathogenesis is not clear. Several studies have examined the association of -308G>A promoter polymorphism in the tumor necrosis factor-α gene (TNF-α) with ischemic stroke susceptibility. However, the results of these studies are inconsistent and the sample sizes of most of the studies were small. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to provide a more robust estimate of the effect of the TNF-α 308G>A polymorphism on the risk for ischemic stroke. METHODS: Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the strength of the association of TNF-α polymorphisms with ischemic stroke. Cochran's Q statistic and the inconsistency index (I) were used to explore heterogeneity. Egger's test and inverted funnel plots were used to investigate publication bias. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria involving 3515 cases and 3949 controls. A significant association was found between TNF-α 308G>A polymorphism and the development of ischemic stroke in the Asian population. However, no statistically significant association was observed in the overall analysis and in the Caucasian population. In the subgroup analysis by age, a significant association was found in the juvenile and adult populations, showing that TNF-α 308G>A polymorphism is associated with the risk for juvenile ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that TNF-α 308G>A polymorphism is associated with the risk for juvenile ischemic stroke, whereas it is a protective factor for ischemic stroke in Asians and the adult population. However, in the overall analysis and in Caucasians, a significant association was not found.

22843016|t|Contamination and adulteration of herbal medicinal products (HMPs): an overview of systematic reviews.
22843016|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this overview of systematic reviews is to summarise and critically evaluate the evidence from systematic reviews of the adulteration and contamination of herbal medicinal products (HMPs). METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant systematic reviews. RESULTS: Twenty-six systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria. The most commonly HMPs were adulterated or contaminated with dust, pollens, insects, rodents, parasites, microbes, fungi, mould, toxins, pesticides, toxic heavy metals and/or prescription drugs. The most severe adverse effects caused by these adulterations were agranulocytosis, meningitis, multi-organ failure, perinatal stroke, arsenic, lead or mercury poisoning, malignancies or carcinomas, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, nephrotoxicity, rhabdomyolysis, metabolic acidosis, renal or liver failure, cerebral edema, coma, intracerebral haemorrhage, and death. Adulteration and contamination of HMPs were most commonly noted for traditional Indian and Chinese remedies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively these data suggest that there are reasons for concerns with regards to the quality of HMPs. Adulteration and contamination of HMPs can cause serious adverse effects. More stringent quality control and its enforcement seem to be necessary to avoid health risks.

22391677|t|Effect of acupuncture on hippocampal Ref-1 expression in cerebral multi-infarction rats.
22391677|a|Redox effector factor (Ref-1) is a sensitive marker for oxidative cellular injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acupuncture on hippocampal Ref-1 expression in cerebral multi-infarction rats. The rats with reference memory impairment were randomly allocated to three groups: impaired group, acupuncture group and placebo acupuncture group. Moreover, normal group and sham-operated group were set as control groups. Morris water maze test showed that cerebral multi-infarction rats did not present significant changes in spatial working memory performance. Further investigation by immunohistochemistry revealed that acupunctural treatment significantly increased the expression of Ref-1 in the hippocampus of the impaired rats. These findings suggested that the spatial working memory was unaffected in the cerebral multi-infarction rats although spatial reference memory deficits were detected in our previous study; in addition, acupuncture could increase the Ref-1 expression, consequently exerting the anti-oxidant effects.

23713245|t|[Different treatment modes for cerebral microlesions: a comparison of clinical efficacy].
23713245|a|OBJECTIVE: To tentatively establish a diagnosis and treatment mode for effectively controlling the progress of cerebral microlesions (CM) and preventing the incidence of cerebral infarction (CI) by comparing different intervention modes for treating CM. METHODS: Using a prospective, nonrandomized, controlled trial, 408 subjects with multiple CM were assigned to the Chinese medical pharmacy intervention group (Group A, 100 case), the aspirin intervention group (Group B, 104 cases), the negative control group (Group C, 100 cases), and the non-intervention group (Group D, 104 cases). No intervention was given to those in Group D. Patients in the other 3 groups were intervened by life style and routine therapies of vasculogenic risk factors. Those in Group A took Guizhi Fuling Pill (GFP) and earthworm powder additionally. Those in Group B took aspirin additionally. They were routinely followed-up. The CM, the changes of vasculogenic risk factors, and the incidence rate of CI were compared among the 4 groups. RESULTS: The total effective rate of CM was 66.67% in Group A, obviously higher than that of Group B (52.32%), Group C (42.86%), and Group D (37.04%), respectively. It was obviously higher in Group B than in Group D, showing statistical difference (P <0.01, P <0.05). After treatment, the serum levels of LDL-C, TC, and TG were obviously lower in Group A than in Group B (P <0.05); the serum levels of LDL-C and TC were obviously lower in Group A than in Group C (P <0.01); the systolic pressure was obviously lower in Group A than in Group D (P <0.05). The systolic pressure and the serum TC level were obviously lower in Group C than in Group D (P <0.05). The incidence rate of CI was 2.17% (2/92 cases) in Group A, obviously lower than that of Group C (11.36% ,10/88 cases) and Group D (14.44%, 13/90 cases), showing statistical difference (P <0.05). But there was no statistical difference between Group A and Group B (6.74% ,6/89 cases) (P >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: GFP combined earthworm powder could treat CM, control vasculogenic risk factors, and finally prevent the incidence of CI. Standard Chinese medical intervention mode showed the optimal effects in treating CM and preventing the incidence of CI, and perhaps it could be spread clinically.

23224686|t|Bleeding of new oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
23224686|a|PURPOSE: Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors and oral direct thrombin inhibitors are new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). We systematically reviewed their risk of major bleeding and efficacy in thromboembolism reduction in AF. METHODS: Eligible randomized controlled trials evaluating NOACs for stroke prevention in AF patients were identified from a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane database. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a Mantel-Haenzel random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies (n = 61,406) were included. Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors were more effective in reducing stroke and systemic embolism compared to controls (RR 0.71, 95 % CI 0.54-0.92, P = 0.009) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (RR 0.84, 95 % CI 0.74-0.94, P = 0.002), with no significant difference in major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding (against controls: RR 0.94, 95 % CI 0.75-1.18, P = 0.60; against VKAs: RR 0.90, 95 % 0.69-1.17, P = 0.44). Oral direct thrombin inhibitors were associated with an improved major and CRNM bleeding profile (both comparisons: RR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.78-0.98, P = 0.02) and a significant reduction in stroke and systemic embolism (against controls: RR 0.79, 95 % CI 0.66-0.93, P = 0.006; against VKAs: RR 0.78, 95 % CI 0.66-0.93, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors and oral direct thrombin inhibitors are more effective in reducing stroke and systemic embolism without increasing the risk of major bleeding compared to traditional oral anticoagulants. This favorable risk-benefit balance should be further confirmed by long-term, large-scale safety studies.

23620940|t|[Exploration on the characteristics of meridian points in the treatment of post-stroke disorder with acupuncture and moxibustion based on the data mining technology].
23620940|a|Using data mining technology to analyze the application characteristics and laws of the meridian points in the treatment of post-stroke disorder with acupuncture and moxibustion in modern times. On the basis of the collection of the modern literatures about the treatment of post-stroke disorder with acupuncture and moxibustion, the database of acupuncture-moxibustion prescription was established. The relevance rule method in the data mining technology was mainly adopted to analyze the application characteristics and laws of the meridian points in the treatment of post-stroke disorder with acupuncture and moxibustion. Totally, 682 prescription of acupuncture and moxibustion were collected, including 253 acupoints and 5395 application frequency. The selected acupoints were distributed in the fourteen meridians and 76.5% (4128/5395) of them were on the four limbs and 13.8% (744/5395) were on the head and neck. The total application frequency of the yang meridians accounted for 74.7% (4029/5395) and the specific acupoints for 83.8% (4522/5395). It was indicated that in the treatment of post-stroke disorder with acupuncture and moxibustion, the acupoint selection was basically along the involved meridians, which was focused on the local affected areas and combined with the distal acupoints. The acupoints of the yang meridians were the first option, distributed mainly on the four limbs. The combination of yangming meridian and shaoyang meridian was the most common. The specific acupoints were the major components of the prescription, especially the crossing acupoints and the specific acupoints located below the elbows and knee joints.

23646468|t|[Effects of rhubarb powder on serum complement 3, complement 4, and hs-CRP in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage].
23646468|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of rhubarb powder on serum complement 3 (C3), complement 4 (C4), and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) after operation. METHODS: Forty inpatients with HICH after operation were recruited from Department of Cerebral Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi College of Traditional Chinese Medicine from July 2009 to March 2010. They were randomly assigned to the treatment group (20 cases) and the control group (20 cases). From the 4th day after surgery, all patients received routine Western medical treatment. The rhubarb powder, 5-10 g dissolving in 40 mL warm water, was administered or nasally fed to those in the treatment group, 2 -3 times daily for 10 successive days. The contents of serum C3, C4, and hs-CRP were detected in the two groups on the 7th day and the 14th day after operation. The serum hs-CRP content was detected using latex particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. The Scandinavia Stroke Scale (SSS) scores were recorded in the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with the same group on the 4th day after operation, the levels of serum C3 and C4 increased on the 7th day after operation, and SSS score increased on the 14th day after operation in the control group (P < 0.05). The contents of C4 and hs-CRP decreased, and the SSS score increased on the 14th day after operation in the treatment group (P < 0.05). Compared with the same group on the 7th day after operation, the contents of C4 and hs-CRP decreased and the SSS score increased on the 14th day after operation in the treatment group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group at the same time points, the contents of C4 and C3 decreased on the 7th day after operation; the contents of C3, C4, and hs-CRP decreased, and SSS score increased in the treatment group on the 14th day after operation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The rhubarb powder could significantly decrease the serum levels of C3, C4, and hs-CRP, and improve the curative effect in patients with HICH after operation.

23286284|t|Modulation of esterified drug metabolism by tanshinones from Salvia miltiorrhiza ("Danshen").
23286284|a|The roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza ("Danshen") are used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of numerous ailments including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and ischemic stroke. Extracts of S. miltiorrhiza roots in the formulation "Compound Danshen Dripping Pill" are undergoing clinical trials in the United States. To date, the active components of this material have not been conclusively identified. We have determined that S. miltiorrhiza roots contain potent human carboxylesterase (CE) inhibitors, due to the presence of tanshinones. K(i) values in the nM range were determined for inhibition of both the liver and intestinal CEs. As CEs hydrolyze clinically used drugs, the ability of tanshinones and S. miltiorrhiza root extracts to modulate the metabolism of the anticancer prodrug irinotecan (CPT-11) was assessed. Our results indicate that marked inhibition of human CEs occurs following incubation with both pure compounds and crude material and that drug hydrolysis is significantly reduced. Consequently, a reduction in the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is observed following dosing with either purified tanshinones or S. miltiorrhiza root extracts. It is concluded that remedies containing tanshinones should be avoided when individuals are taking esterified agents and that patients should be warned of the potential drug-drug interaction that may occur with this material.

25206592|t|Acupuncture at Waiguan (TE5) influences activation/deactivation of functional brain areas in ischemic stroke patients and healthy people: A functional MRI study.
25206592|a|In the present study, 10 patients with ischemic stroke in the left hemisphere and six healthy controls were subjected to acupuncture at right Waiguan (TE5). In ischemic stroke subjects, functional MRI showed enhanced activation in Broadmann areas 5, 6, 7, 18, 19, 24, 32, the hypothalamic inferior lobe, the mamillary body, and the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the left hemisphere, and Broadmann areas 4, 6, 7, 18, 19 and 32 of the right hemisphere, but attenuated activation of Broadmann area 13, the hypothalamic inferior lobe, the posterior lobe of the tonsil of cerebellum, and the culmen of the anterior lobe of hypophysis, in the left hemisphere and Broadmann area 13 in the right hemisphere. In ischemic stroke subjects, a number of deactivated brain areas were enhanced, including Broadmann areas 6, 11, 20, 22, 37, and 47, the culmen of the anterior lobe of hypophysis, alae lingulae cerebella, and the posterior lobe of the tonsil of cerebellum of the left hemisphere, and Broadmann areas 8, 37, 45 and 47, the culmen of the anterior lobe of hypophysis, pars tuberalis adenohypophyseos, inferior border of lentiform nucleus, lateral globus pallidus, inferior temporal gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus of the right hemisphere. These subjects also exhibited attenuation of a number of deactivated brain areas, including Broadmann area 7. These data suggest that acupuncture at Waiguan specifically alters brain function in regions associated with sensation, vision, and motion in ischemic stroke patients. By contrast, in normal individuals, acupuncture at Waiguan generally activates brain areas associated with insomnia and other functions.

23317415|t|Total white blood cell count or neutrophil count predict ischemic stroke events among adult Taiwanese: report from a community-based cohort study.
23317415|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence about whether white blood cell (WBC) or its subtypes can act as a biomarker to predict the ischemic stroke events in the general population is scanty, particularly in Asian populations. The aim of this study is to establish the predictive ability of total WBC count or subtypes for long-term ischemic stroke events in the cohort population in Taiwan. METHODS: The Chin-Shan Community Cohort Study began from 1990 to 2007 by recruiting 1782 men and 1814 women of Chinese ethnicity. Following a total of 3416 participants free from ischemic stroke events at baseline for a median of 15.9 years; we documented 187 new incident cases. RESULTS: The multivariate relative risk for the comparison of the participants in the fifth and first WBC count quintiles was 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.73; P for trend=0.03), and the corresponding relative risk for neutrophil count was 1.93 (95% CI, 1.13-3.29; P for trend=0.02). The discriminative ability by WBC and neutrophil counts were similar (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.600 for adding WBC, 0.610 for adding neutrophils, 0.595 for traditional risk factor model). In addition, the net reclassification improvement (NRI) values between the neutrophil and white blood cell count models were not significant (NRI, =-2.60%, P=0.35), indicating the similar discrimination performance for both WBC and neutrophil counts. CONCLUSIONS: WBC and neutrophil count had a similar ability to predict the long-term ischemic stroke events among Taiwanese.

24117062|t|Efficacy of Integrated Rehabilitation Techniques of Traditional Chinese Medicine for ischemic stroke: a randomized controlled trial.
24117062|a|This study aimed to determine the efficacy of Integrated Rehabilitation Techniques of Traditional Chinese Medicine (IRT-TCM) on patients with ischemic stroke as an alternative therapy to conventional rehabilitation techniques. Sixty-nine patients with ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to receive either IRT-TCM (intervention group, n = 46) or conventional rehabilitation techniques (control group, n = 23). The IRT-TCM consisted of a sequential combination of acupuncture and massage techniques. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were measured on day 0 (baseline, before treatment), day 21, and day 90. We observed that the scores in FMA and BI were increased, and NIHSS were decreased in both groups on day 21 and 90, compared with the baseline (day 0). Furthermore, significantly better scores in FMA of lower limbs and NIHSS were found in patients treated with IRT-TCM on day 21 and 90. For mRS, the percentage of patients ranking 0 and 1 in the intervention group presented a striking contrast to the control group on day 90 but with no significant difference. The results indicated that, as a feasible alternative therapy, IRT-TCM is beneficial for patients with ischemic stroke. Further research with larger sample size, long-term observation, and strict blinding are still in need to confirm the efficacy of IRT-TCM.

23548919|t|Drugs from natural substances: why study them in cerebral infarction.
23548916|t|The NeuroAiD II (MLC901) in vascular cognitive impairment study (NEURITES).
23548916|a|BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of patients after nondisabling stroke are cognitively impaired compared to age- and education-matched community-dwelling controls. Moreover, poststroke patients who have 'vascular cognitive impairment no dementia' (VCIND) of moderate severity have a high risk of incident dementia, dependency and death. Further studies are urgently needed to demonstrate effective cognition-enhancing therapies in VCIND given the scarcity of evidence-based treatment options. NeuroAiD is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been shown to induce neuroplasticity, promote cell proliferation and stimulate the development of dense axonal and dendritic networks in animal stroke models. NeuroAiD may improve cerebral blood flow and functional recovery after stroke in patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects and tolerability of NeuroAiD II in patients with VCIND. METHODS: The NeuroAiD II (MLC901) in Vascular Cognitive Impairment Study (NEURITES) is a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study of NeuroAiD II in patients with VCIND. The primary outcome is executive function as measured by the Verbal Fluency test. Secondary outcomes include cognitive assessments such as the ADAS-Cog, MoCA, MMSE and Cognitive Battery: activities of daily living as measured by the Alzhei-mer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale for mild cognitive impairment, behavior as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and depression as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Scale. In addition, there will be novel exploratory outcomes: (a) magnetic resonance imaging of lesion location (structural imaging), structural integrity of white matter pathways (diffusion tensor imaging), neuronal function (resting studies) and perfusion (arterial spin labeling and MR angiography), and (b) retinal and optic nerve imaging. Safety and tolerability will be assessed using adverse events, laboratory tests and vital signs. CONCLUSIONS: NEURITES has the potential to set new standards for the systematic evaluation of Asian traditional medicine for integration into standard medicine practice and establishing a novel therapeutic approach for improving cognition after stroke.

23548915|t|Chinese medicine NeuroAiD efficacy stroke recovery-extension study (CHIMES-E study): an observational multicenter study to investigate the longer-term efficacy of NeuroAiD in stroke recovery.
23548915|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke carries a poor long-term prognosis for death and disability. There are few acute treatments that reduce death and disability after stroke. The ongoing international, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind CHIMES trial is currently testing the hypothesis that a 3-month course of the traditional Chinese medicine MLC601 (NeuroAiD) is superior to placebo in reducing neurological deficit and improving functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke in patients receiving standard stroke care. This extension study tests the hypothesis that at 2 years, an initial 3-month administration of NeuroAiD is superior to placebo in reducing neurological deficit and improving functional outcome in patients with cerebral infarction of an intermediate range of severity. METHODS: Study subjects will be those who are already participants in CHIMES - aged above 21 years, had signs and symptoms of acute stroke, 6 ≤ NIHSS ≤ 14, neuroimaging consistent with ischemic stroke, and received study medication within 72 h of stroke onset. A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in CHIMES-E if they have withdrawn consent from all participation and follow-up for CHIMES. Subjects will be contacted at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after CHIMES enrollment. After verbal consent is obtained, subjects will be assessed for functional state by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI), and a history of recurrent vascular events as well as medical events. The primary outcome measure will be the mRS at month 24. Secondary outcome measures will be mRS and BI at 6, 12 and 18 months, and BI at 24 months. Analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. If the number of patients lost to follow-up is substantial, a sensitivity analysis based on the last observation carried forward method will be carried out, to compare the results with those from the main analysis without imputation. Based on a cumulative odds ratio of 1.5 for the NeuroAiD group, a two-sided test of 5% type I error and an expected 30% dropout rate after 2 years of follow-up for the 1,100 patients recruited into CHIMES, the 770 subjects with mRS data expected to be available at year 2 yields an 89% power to detect a difference in efficacy between NeuroAiD and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide evidence for the longer-term efficacy of an initial course of a neurorestorative therapy after acute ischemic stroke of intermediate severity.

23548914|t|Efficacy and safety of MLC601 (NeuroAiD®), a traditional Chinese medicine, in poststroke recovery: a systematic review.
23548914|a|BACKGROUND: Subsequent to a pooled analysis of 2 trials, several more studies have been published assessing the benefit of MLC601 in stroke patients. Hence, it is timely to conduct an updated meta-analysis to frame the interpretation of the results of an ongoing large multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the efficacy of MLC601 in improving the recovery of stroke patients. METHODS: PubMed® and the Cochrane Library® databases were searched for trials evaluating MLC601 in stroke patients. Primary outcome was functional independence, assessed by the Barthel Index or the Diagnostic Therapeutic Effects of Apoplexy scoring system, item 8. Secondary outcomes were improvement in functional independence scores, motor recovery, reduction in visual field defect and increase in cerebral blood flow. Two authors performed the article selection, appraisal and data extraction while resolving differences through discussion or consulting a third author. Data were analyzed in RevMan5®. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. RESULTS: This review included 6 studies with overall low risk of bias but some clinical heterogeneity. MLC601 increased the chances of achieving functional independence after stroke compared to control treatments (risk ratio, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.31-4.23). No deaths and 4 serious adverse events were reported in the MLC601 group, although detail was sparse with inconsistent reporting. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that MLC601 as an add-on to standard treatment could be effective in improving functional independence and motor recovery and is safe for patients with primarily nonacute stable stroke.

24454492|t|Evodiamine Induces Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-1-Mediated Protective Autophagy in U87-MG Astrocytes.
24454492|a|Cerebral ischemia is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, which results in cognitive and motor dysfunction, neurodegenerative diseases, and death. Evodiamine (Evo) is extracted from Evodia rutaecarpa Bentham, a plant widely used in Chinese herbal medicine, which possesses variable biological abilities, such as anticancer, anti-inflammation, antiobesity, anti-Alzheimer's disease, antimetastatic, antianoxic, and antinociceptive functions. But the effect of Evo on ischemic stroke is unclear. Increasing data suggest that activation of autophagy, an adaptive response to environmental stresses, could protect neurons from ischemia-induced cell death. In this study, we found that Evo induced autophagy in U87-MG astrocytes. A scavenger of extracellular calcium and an antagonist of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV-1) decreased the percentage of autophagy accompanied by an increase in apoptosis, suggesting that Evo may induce calcium-mediated protective autophagy resulting from an influx of extracellular calcium. The same phenomena were also confirmed by a small interfering RNA technique to knock down the expression of TRPV1. Finally, Evo-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) activation was reduced by a TRPV1 antagonist, indicating that Evo-induced autophagy may occur through a calcium/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Collectively, Evo induced an influx of extracellular calcium, which led to JNK-mediated protective autophagy, and this provides a new option for ischemic stroke treatment.

24348732|t|Tai chi chuan exercise for patients with cardiovascular disease.
24348732|a|Exercise training is the cornerstone of rehabilitation for patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although high-intensity exercise has significant cardiovascular benefits, light-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise also offers health benefits. With lower-intensity workouts, patients may be able to exercise for longer periods of time and increase the acceptance of exercise, particularly in unfit and elderly patients. Tai Chi Chuan (Tai Chi) is a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise. The exercise intensity of Tai Chi is light to moderate, depending on its training style, posture, and duration. Previous research has shown that Tai Chi enhances aerobic capacity, muscular strength, balance, and psychological well-being. Additionally, Tai Chi training has significant benefits for common cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, poor exercise capacity, endothelial dysfunction, and depression. Tai Chi is safe and effective in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, congestive heart failure (HF), and stroke.

24159346|t|Tai chi chuan in medicine and health promotion.
24159346|a|Tai Chi Chuan (Tai Chi) is a Chinese traditional mind-body exercise and recently, it becomes popular worldwide. During the practice of Tai Chi, deep diaphragmatic breathing is integrated into body motions to achieve a harmonious balance between body and mind and to facilitate the flow of internal energy (Qi). Participants can choose to perform a complete set of Tai Chi or selected movements according to their needs. Previous research substantiates that Tai Chi has significant benefits to health promotion, and regularly practicing Tai Chi improves aerobic capacity, muscular strength, balance, health-related quality of life, and psychological well-being. Recent studies also prove that Tai Chi is safe and effective for patients with neurological diseases (e.g., stroke, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, cognitive dysfunction), rheumatological disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and fibromyalgia), orthopedic diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, low-back pain, and musculoskeletal disorder), cardiovascular diseases (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, and heart failure), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and breast cancers. Tai Chi is an aerobic exercise with mild-to-moderate intensity and is appropriate for implementation in the community. This paper reviews the existing literature on Tai Chi and introduces its health-promotion effect and the potential clinical applications.

23861695|t|A systematic review and meta-analysis of buyang huanwu decoction in animal model of focal cerebral ischemia.
23861695|a|Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD) is a well-known Chinese herbal prescription for ischemic stroke. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide the current evidence for neuroprotective effects of BHD and its possible mechanisms in animal models of focal ischemia. A systematic literature search, through October 2012, was performed using six databases. The outcome measures assessed were infarct size and/or neurological score. Fifty-six studies with 1270 animals that met the inclusion criteria were identified. The median score for methodological quality was 3 with a range of 2 to 6. Compared with vehicle or no treatment controls, BHD gave a 37% improvement in outcome for all doses ranging from 1.0 g/kg to 60 g/kg at each time point that BHD was administered (P < 0.01). Efficacy was higher in mouse models that utilized suture occlusion and temporary ischemia. The neuroprotective effects of BHD are involved in multiple mechanisms and act upon multiple cell types. In conclusion, BHD possesses substantial neuroprotective effects in experimental stroke probably as a result of the multitarget therapy strategy typically utilized in traditional Chinese medicine. Future research should examine the presence of possible experimental bias and an in-depth study of herbal compound preparations.

23662126|t|A two-level model for the analysis of syndrome of acute ischemic stroke: from diagnostic model to molecular mechanism.
23662126|a|Prompt and accurate diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke is critical to seek acute therapy. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) science, there is a comprehensive system of diagnosis and medical care of acute ischemic stroke. Here we introduce a two-level model for the analysis of TCM syndrome of acute ischemic stroke. Owing to the limitation of sample size and imbalance, we focused on the analysis of wind-phlegm collateral obstruction syndrome (Feng Tan Yu Zu Zheng). Firstly, a Support-Vector-Machine- (SVM-) based diagnostic model was set up through selection of core symptoms. After pairwise undersampling, we improved the performance of prediction and generated the core symptoms-based diagnostic model of wind-phlegm collateral obstruction syndrome. Next, Pathway Pattern-based method and MetaDrug platform were used to shed light on the molecular basis of the significance of core symptoms in three complementary aspects: symptom-gene-pathway multilayer correlation network, enriched pathways, and most relevant interaction network. The integration of diagnostic model and molecular mechanism analysis creates an interesting perspective for better understanding the syndrome. The two-level model would provide a new opportunity for the study of TCM syndromes.

23165960|t|Electroacupuncture exerts anti-inflammatory effects in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injured rats via suppression of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.
23165960|a|Inflammatory response has been shown to play a critical role in brain damage after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, which is tightly regulated by the Toll-like receptor (TLR)4/nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway; therefore, suppression of TLR4/NF-κB signaling has become a promising target for the anti-inflammatory treatment in ischemic stroke. Acupuncture has been used as a complementary and alternative therapy practice that supplements conventional medicine. Numerous studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in stroke rehabilitation. However, the precise mechanism of its neuroprotective effect remains poorly understood. Using a focal cerebral I/R injured rat model, in the present study we evaluated the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities of electroacupuncture at Quchi and Zusanli, and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that electroacupuncture at Quchi (LI11) and Zusanli (ST36) acupoints significantly improved the ischemia-associated scores of neurological deficits, reduced cerebral infarction and alleviated inflammatory responses. Moreover, the crucial signaling molecules in the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway were regulated by acupuncture, which coincided with suppressed secretion levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Our data suggest that electroacupuncture exerts a neuroprotective function in ischemic stroke through inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB-mediated inflammation.

23129018|t|Electroacupuncture promotes neurological functional recovery via the retinoic acid signaling pathway in rats following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.
23129018|a|Neurogenesis is regulated by a number of signaling pathways, including the retinoic acid (RA) pathway, a key regulator of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus. Acupuncture has been used to treat neurological conditions and is known to potentially enhance cell proliferation in the neurogenic area (hippocampal dentate gyrus and the SVZ of the lateral ventricle walls) in pathological conditions, which is associated with improved brain function. However, whether or not the neuroprotective effects of electroacupuncture (EA) are mediated by the regulation of the RA signaling pathway remains to be determined. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, in the present study we evaluated the effect of EA on the neurological functional recovery, infarction volume and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. Two hundred and sixteen SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham, model group (ischemic rats without EA stimulation) and EA group (ischemic rats with EA stimulation on ST36 and LI11). Behavioral deficits were detected with high-resolution digital analysis of 24-h home-cage video recordings. Infarct volume was determined by triphenyltetrazolium hydrochloride staining and the expression of RA mRNA and protein was measured using RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. We found that EA decreased the infarct volume, promoted neurological functional recovery and increased the RA mRNA and protein expression, compared with the model group. Findings of this study suggest that promoting neurological functional recovery by modulating RA expression in the post-ischemic brain is one of the mechanisms by which EA can be effective in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

24215922|t|Acupuncture therapy for stroke patients.
24215922|a|Acupuncture is one of the most important parts of Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been used for more than 3000 years as prevention and treatment for various diseases in China as well as in adjacent regions, and is widely accepted in western countries in recent years. More and more clinical trials revealed that acupuncture shows positive effect in stroke, not only as a complementary and alternative medicine for poststroke rehabilitation but also as a preventive strategy which could induce cerebral ischemic tolerance, especially when combined with modern electrotherapy. Acupuncture has some unique characteristics, which include acupoint specificity and parameter-dependent effect. It also involves complicated mechanism to exert the beneficial effect on stroke. Series of clinical trials have shown that acupuncture primarily regulates the release of neurochemicals, hemorheology, cerebral microcirculation, metabolism, neuronal activity, and the function of specific brain region. Animal studies showed that the effects of acupuncture therapy on stroke were possibly via inhibition of postischemic inflammatory reaction, stimulation of neurogenesis and angiogenesis, and influence on neural plasticity. Mechanisms for its preconditioning effect include activity enhancement of antioxidant, regulation of the endocannabinoid system, and inhibition of apoptosis. Although being controversial, acupuncture is a promising preventive and treatment strategy for stroke, but further high-quality clinical trials would be needed to provide more confirmative evidence.

23596797|t|[Promotion of compound fujian tablet on the motor function rehabilitation and neurotization in rats with cerebral infarction].
23596797|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Compound Fujian Tablet (FJT)on the neurotization in the cerebral infarction rats and to explore its mechanisms for promoting the motor skills. METHODS: Totally 90 Wistar rats were randomly divided into the drug group, the model group, and the sham-operation group, 30 in each group. The rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was successfully established by electrocoagulation. Six hours after successful modeling, the rats of the drug group were orally administered with 9 g/kg FJT water solution, and the other groups were orally administered with equal volume of normal saline, once a day for two weeks. The motor skills of rats were examined by beam walking test. The expressions of nestin, polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), growth-associated protein (GAP-43), and synaptophysin (Syn) in the brain tissue around the infarction were observed by in immunohistochemical assay. The mean staining gray or the optical density value were detected. RESULTS: The 86 rats were recruited in the result analysis. After two weeks of administration, the neural function scoring was obviously higher in the drug group than in the model group with statistical difference (P < 0.01). The expressions of nestin, PSA-NCAM, MAP-2, GAP-43, and Syn in the brain tissue around the infarction were more obviously enhanced in the drug group than in the model group, showing statistical difference (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: FJT can promote neurotization and improve the motor skill recovery after cerebral infarction.

23596883|t|[Molecular mechanism research on simultaneous therapy of brain and heart based on data mining and network analysis].
23596883|a|OBJECTIVE: The theory of treating heart and brain simultaneously is from the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, and there aren't enough explanations for this theory from the perspective of molecular mechanism. As one successful case of this theory, the Chinese medicine formula--Buchang Naoxintong can achieve the goal of treating coronary heart disease and stroke at the same time. To illustrate the mechanism of the theory of treating heart and brain simultaneously, it is necessary to find out the molecular mechanism of this formula. METHOD: Using the network analysis method, together with two data mining methods-clustering and apriori algorithm, the frequent gene combinations interfered by the chemicals of the formula based on the protein-protein interaction networks related with coronary heart disease and stroke disease were figured out respectively. To find out the molecular mechanism of the theory of treating heart and brain simultaneously, the results got from two diseases were compared and analyzed. RESULT: Based on comparing two results from these two different diseases, the mechanism of the theory of treating heart and brain simultaneously was explained from molecular level by finding out key genes targeted by the components of this formula for both diseases and some particular genes interfered by the components for each disease. In addition, genes interfered indirectly by the chemicals for different diseases were found out based on the protein-protein interaction network. CONCLUSION: It can help to explain the molecular mechanism of the theory by our methods. By finding out the molecular mechanism of this theory, it can promote the progress of combination of Chinese traditional and Western medicine.

23286451|t|Anti-inflammatory effects of isopropyl 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxypropanoate, a novel metabolite from danshen, on activated microglia.
23286451|a|Down-regulation of microglial activation represents a practical strategy for combating diverse brain disorders such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we showed evidence that isopropyl 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxypropanoate (IDHP), a new bioactive metabolite of Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge), exerted an anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- induced microglia. Our data showed that IDHP significantly reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in LPS-induced BV-2 cells and rat primary microglia in a dose-dependent manner. IDHP also suppressed mRNA expression of LPSinduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-α and IL-1β. Moreover, IDHP significantly suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) translocation and DNA binding activity induced by LPS treatment in BV-2 cells. These findings indicated that IDHP might be of value in the treatment of various microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases.

25317148|t|Use of acupuncture to treat cerebral infarction in the last 10 years: A Scopus-based literature analysis.
25317148|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify global research trends in the use of acupuncture to treat cerebral infarction. DATA RETRIEVAL: We performed a bibliometric analysis of studies on the use of acupuncture to treat cerebral infarction published during 2002-2011, retrieved from Scopus, using the key words of acupuncture and cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke. SELECTION CRITERIA: INCLUSION CRITERIA: peer-reviewed articles on the use of acupuncture to treat cerebral infarction indexed in Scopus and published between 2002 and 2011; types of publications were original research articles, reviews, meeting abstracts, proceedings papers, book chapters, editorial material, and news items. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: articles that required manual searching or telephone access; documents that were not published in the public domain; and corrected papers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (a) Annual publication output; (b) language of publication; (c) type of publication; (d) key words of publication; (e) publication by research field; (f) publication by journal; (g) publication by country and institution; (h) publication by author; (i) most-cited papers between 2002 and 2006; and (j) most-cited papers between 2007 and 2011. RESULTS: A total of 160 publications on the use of acupuncture to treat cerebral infarction from 2002-2011 were retrieved from Scopus. The number of publications increased gradually over the 10-year study period; most were written in Chinese or English. Articles and reviews constituted the major types. The most frequent key word used was acupuncture. The most prolific journals in this area were Zhongguo Zhen Jiu and the Chinese Journal of Clinical Rehabilitation. Of the 160 publications retrieved, half came from Chinese authors and institutions. Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine was the most prolific research institute. Two papers were cited 30 times; they were published in 2002 and 2009, respectively. CONCLUSION: In the field of neuroscience, there is little literature on acupuncture for cerebral infarction. The most-cited papers were cited 30 times in the past 3 years. We believe that, with advances in the study of mechanisms in neurobiology, research on acupuncture will also advance and will become the concern of more scholars.

23427407|t|Effect of tonifying liver and kidney-essence herbs on expression of Nogo-A and p75(NTR) in cerebral ischemic stroke rats model.
23427407|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of tonifying liver and kidney-essence herbs on expression of a nerve regeneration inhibitor, Nogo for neuron A (Nogo-A), and its associated signaling molecule, low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75(NTR)), in rats with cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS), with the aim of exploring the possible mechanism of tonifying liver and kidney-essence herbs in recovery following injury to the central nervous system. METHODS: A cerebral ischemic stroke model in SD rats was established with the suture-occlusion method. Successful model rats were divided into placebo and herb groups at random; sham-operated and control groups were set up simultaneously. Each of these groups was divided into six subgroups at random. Expression of Nogo-A and p75(NTR) was evaluated with immunofluorescence microscopy at days 3, and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 after administration. RESULTS: Tonifying liver and kidney-essence herbs suppressed the expression of Nogo-A and p75(NTR) (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Suppressing the expression of Nogo-A and p75(NTR) is possibly one of the mechanisms underlying the ability of tonifying liver and kidney-essence herbs to promote recovery of the injured central nervous system.

23469609|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Tongxinluo (TXL) on angiogenesis and the volume of blood perfusion in ischemic stroke rats. METHODS: The model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established using craniotomy ligation of the middle cerebral artery on one side. After screening, the male SD rats were randomly divided into the sham-operation group, the model group, the large dose TXL group, the middle dose TXL group, the low dose TXL group, and the Nimodipine group. The expression of microvascular density (MVD, CD31) of the MCAO rats was detected using immunohistochemical assay after 14 days of medication. The microvascular morphology and the volume of blood perfusion in the brain tissue were observed under laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). RESULTS: The positive CD31 expression was intense with significant coloring in the large dose TXL group, the middle dose TXL group, and the Nimodipine group, better than that of the model group. The blood perfusion volume in the ischemic brain cortex could be promoted in the large dose TXL group, the middle dose TXL group, and the Nimodipine group (P<0.01, P<0.05). The optimal effects were shown in the large dose TXL group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: TXL significantly increased the MVD of the ischemic brain tissue, promoted the post-ischemic angiogenesis, and increased the volume of blood perfusion of ischemic brain tissue, playing certain blood flow compensatory roles.

23000169|t|Cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis induced by Equisetum hyemale extract in murine leukemia L1210 cells.
23000169|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Equisetum hyemale has been used as a traditional herbal medicine to treat various diseases such as hypertension, inflammatory diseases, acute stroke, bleeding and cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-proliferative effect and the underlying mechanisms of E.hyemale extract on murine leukemia L1210 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibitory effect of Ehyemale extract on L1210cells was evaluated by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Cell cycle distribution was evaluated with flow cytometry following PI (propidium iodide) staining. Apoptotic cell death was determined by Annexin V-FITC/PI and nuclear DAPI (4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. DNA damage and changes of mitochondrial membrane potential were also detected with flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: E.hyemale extract exerted significant antiproliferative effects on L1210 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed that E.hyemale extract induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in L1210 cells. Phosphatidylserine exposure, chromatin condensation, DNA damage and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were observed clearly after treatment with Ehyemale extract. CONCLUSION: The results in this study indicate that E.hyemale extract could inhibit L1210 cell proliferation through inducing G2/M arrest and cell apoptosis.

23152229|t|Shengmai (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) for heart failure.
23152229|a|BACKGROUND: This systemic review is an update of a review previously published in 2011. Heart failure is a major public health problem worldwide. Shengmai (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) has long been used as a complementary treatment for heart failure in China. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (both benefits and harms) of Shengmai for heart failure. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL and DARE on The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to March 2011), AMED (1985 to August 2008) (AMED was not searched for the update as it is no longer available to the person conducting the searches), BIOSIS (1969 to March 2011), CBM (1978 to April 2011), VIP (1989 to April 2011) and CNKI (1979 to April 2011). We also handsearched Chinese journals. No language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Shengmai plus usual treatment versus usual treatment alone or Shengmai versus placebo in treating heart failure, irrespective of blinding status, were included. More stringent inclusion criteria were applied in this update and only studies with a clear description of randomization methods and classified as true RCTs were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Dichotomous and continuous data were calculated as relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD), respectively. A random-effects model and fixed-effect model were used to perform meta-analysis with and without heterogeneity, respectively. MAIN RESULTS: Nine RCTs (600 patients) with seven comparing Shengmai plus usual treatment with usual treatment alone and three comparing Shengmai with placebo (one RCT contained three arms) were included in this updated review. Based upon the seven RCTs (494 patients), improvement of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification was more common in patients taking Shengmai plus usual treatment than in those receiving usual treatment alone (risk ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.47). Beneficial effects of Shengmai in treating heart failure were also observed on other outcomes, including an exercise test, ejection fraction, cardiac output, cardiac index and left ventricular end-systolic volume. The three RCTs (106 patients) which compared Shengmai with placebo reported an improvement in NYHA functional classification, ejection fraction, stroke volume, cardiac index and myocardial contractility. Three out of the nine RCTs reported mild adverse effects, and two patients were withdrawn due to the adverse effects. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution. This is due to the studies being of low quality, their small sample size, and the significant heterogeneity for certain outcomes including ejection fraction and cardiac output. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Shengmai may be beneficial in treating heart failure, especially in terms of improving the NYHA functional classification with Shengmai plus usual treatment. However, the evidence for its effects on mortality and hospitalisation are not available yet. Therefore more studies, of higher quality and long-term follow-up, are needed to provide more evidence for the future use of Shengmai.

23145765|t|The effect of acupuncture on stroke recovery: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
23145765|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in China. Current treatments for stroke are limited and achieve no optimal effect. Acupuncture is widely used in the treatment of stroke and in improving the quality of life for patients in China. In most previous clinical studies, the effects of acupuncture have been diverse, and few well-designed randomized controlled trials have been conducted to investigate the long-term effect of acupuncture on acute stroke recovery. METHOD: Three hundred and twenty eight subjects with acute cerebral apoplexy will be recruited. The patients will be randomized into two different groups: the intervention group will receive acupuncture treatment together with Western standard treatment for 2 weeks plus the secondary prevention treatment for 22 weeks; the control group will receive only the Western standard treatment for 2 weeks and the secondary prevention treatment for 22 weeks. The primary outcome measures are Barthel Index and the Stroke-Specific Quality Of Life. The secondary outcome measures are the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Modified Rankin Scale. All assessments will be conducted at the baseline and at weeks 4, 12 and 24 of follow-up. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the effects of acupuncture on the long-term recovery of acute stroke and on improving the quality of life of the patients. The results of this study will help establish optimal integrated therapeutic strategies for patients with stroke. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN29932220.

22898760|t|Clinical efficacy of traditional chinese medicine on acute myocardial infarction: a prospective cohort study.
22898760|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of Chinese medicine (CM) on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with a prospective cohort study. METHODS: A total of 334 AMI patients from January 2007 to March 2009 were consecutively enrolled, and were assigned to a treatment group (169 cases) treated with combined therapy (CM for at least one month and Western medicine) and a control group (165 cases) with Western medicine alone. Clinical data including age, gender, smoking, medical history, infarction area, heart functional classification, CM syndrome scores, blood-stasis syndrome score, primary end-point (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization) and secondary end-point (ischemic stroke, rehospitalization due to angina, heart failure and shock), were collected. CM syndrome scores, blood-stasis syndrome score, primary end-point and secondary end-point were collected during the 6-month follow-up. Kaplan-Meier method was used for the survival analysis. The multifactor analysis was analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: At the end of 6-month the CM syndrome score and bloodstasis syndrome score in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.01), especially the symptoms of chest pain, spontaneous perspiration and insomnia. Rehospitalization rate due to angina during the 6-month follow-up in the treatment group (2.96%) was lower than that in the control group (7.88%, P<0.05). Kaplan- Meier survival curve showed that event-free cumulated survival of rehospitalization due to angina during the 6-month follow-up in the treatment group was higher than that in the control group (Log rank 4.700, P=0.03). Cox regression analysis showed that heart dysfunction [hazard ratio (HR)=1.601, 95% CI=1.084-2.364, P=0.018] and diabetes mellitus (HR=1.755, 95% CI=1.031-2.989, P=0.038) were hazard factors to end-point, whereas CM (HR 0.405, 95% CI=0.231-0.712, P=0.002), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, HR=0.352, 95% CI=0.204-0.607, P<0.001) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (HR=0.541, 95% CI=0.313-0.936, P=0.028) were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: CM therapy could decrease CM syndrome scores and blood-stasis syndrome score, reduce the rehospitalization rate during 6-month follow-up due to angina. Heart dysfunction and diabetes mellitus were hazard factors to end-point, whereas CM, PCI and ACE inhibitors were protective factors.

22902827|t|Neuroprotective effects of curculigoside against NMDA-induced neuronal excitoxicity in vitro.
22902827|a|Glutamate is an important excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Excessive accumulation of glutamate can cause excitotoxicity, which plays a key role in spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. Curculigoside (CCGS) is a major bioactive compound isolated from the rhizome of Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. CCGS has an extensive biological effect and has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. However, little is known about the neuroprotective effects of CCGS on glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. This study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of CCGS in cultured cortical neurons. The results indicated that treatment with 1 and 10 μM CCGS evidently prevented N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced neuronal cell loss and reduced the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The neuroprotective effects of CCGS are related to down regulating the apoptotic protein levels and reducing the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species in cultured cortical neurons. These findings give a new insight into the development of natural anti-excitotoxicity agents.

22841535|t|Rhynchophylline prevents cardiac dysfunction and improves survival in lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice via suppressing macrophage I-κBα phosphorylation.
22841535|a|Myocardial dysfunction is a common complication during sepsis and significantly contributes to the mortality of patients with septic shock. However, none of the available therapeutic strategies proven to be effective in patients with severe sepsis are designed specifically to target myocardial dysfunction. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of rhynchophylline (Rhy) on LPS-induced myocardial dysfunction in mice. We found that pretreatment with Rhy significantly improved cardiac systolic dysfunction, increased stroke volume and cardiac output in mice challenged with LPS. LPS induced cardiac inhibitor-κBα (I-κBα) phosphorylation, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) mRNA expression, and in turn increased cardiac TNF-α and IL-1β protein production, all of which were attenuated by pretreatment with Rhy. Immunohistochemistry revealed that TNF-α was found in infiltrated macrophages (F4/80(+)) and myocardium, and Rhy reduced TNF-α immunostaining in cardiac infiltrated macrophages in LPS-challenged mice. Furthermore, Rhy inhibited LPS-induced I-κBα phosphorylation and TNF-α production in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages, but not in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Pretreatment with Rhy significantly decreased the mortality of LPS-challenged mice. These results indicate that Rhy reduces cardiac dysfunction and improves survival via suppression of macrophage I-κBα phosphorylation in LPS-challenged mice, and suggest that Rhy may be a potential agent for the treatment of septic cardiac dysfunction.

23203054|t|Bioavailability and brain-targeting of geniposide in gardenia-borneol co-compound by different administration routes in mice.
23203054|a|Both geniposide (Ge) and borneol (Bo) are bioactive substances derived from traditional Chinese medicine. Injections containing co-compound of Gardenia-Borneol are widely used for stroke treatment in China, such as "Xingnaojing" multi-component injection. As more and more adverse reactions (especially drug allergy) were reported, it is urgent to find more effective and safer routes of administration for such kinds of medicines. In this paper, bioavailabilities and brain-target effects of geniposide in Gardenia-Borneol co-compound through different administration routes in mice were investigated. Geniposide concentrations in plasma and in brain of mice were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetics parameters of intranasal (i.n.) and intragastric (i.g.) administration were compared with intravenous (i.v.) administration. The bioavailabilities of Ge were 85.38% and 28.76% for i.n. and i.g. while T(max) were 1 min and 30 min. C(max) were 21.881 ± 5.398, 1.914 ± 0.327 and 42.410 ± 6.268 μg/mL for i.n., i.g. and i.v., respectively. The AUC of Ge in brain were 32413.6 ± 4573.9, 6440.1 ± 863.7 and 37270.5 ± 4160.6 ng/g ·min for i.n., i.g. and i.v., respectively. The drug target indexes (DTI) were 1.02 and 0.60 for i.n. and i.g. The results demonstrated that geniposide could be absorbed promptly and thoroughly by i.n. administration in mice and basically transported into the brain though blood vessel passways.

23359973|t|[Study on the scores of blood stasis syndrome of acute ischemic stroke and its correlation with TOAST subtypes].
23359973|a|OBJECTIVE To compare the differences in the scores of blood stasis syndrome (BSS) in three subtypes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) based on modified Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria, and to explore the influencing factors of BSS.METHODS: Patients with AIS were classified by modified TOAST criteria. The BSS score was determined in 418 patients of atherosclerosis thrombosis (AT), cardioembolism (CE), and small artery disease (SAD) subtypes. The BSS scores were compared in the three subtypes. Univariate analysis and multivariable Logistic analysis were carried out to analyze the influencing factors of BSS. RESULTS: As for the BSS score, CE (120.08 +/- 14.91) > AT (79.56 +/- 11.43) > SAD (37.88 +/- 8.32), and there was statistical difference among different subtypes (P < 0.01). Univariate analysis indicated that age, heart disease, carotid stenosis, NIHSS, GCS, and multiple infarction positions had significant effects on BSS. Multiple Logistic regression analysis suggested that age (OR: 1.71, 95% CII: 1.13-2.74, P = 0.034), heart disease (OR: 2.05,95% CI: 1.52-4.15, P = 0.000), carotid stenosis (OR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.65-4.55, P = 0.007), and multiple infarction positions (OR: 3.46, 95% CI: 2.16-6.62, P = 0.005) were independent influencing factors of BSS. CONCLUSIONS: Different TOAST subtypes of BSS had different BSS scores, which was helpful to indicate the reasons for BSS. Age, heart disease, carotid stenosis, and multiple infarction positions were independent influencing factors of BSS.

22842715|t|Electroacupuncture at the Quchi and Zusanli acupoints exerts neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injured rats via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.
22842715|a|The PI3K/Akt pathway, a critical mediator of cell survival, is suppressed in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury; therefore, it is a major focus in treatment of ischemic stroke. Acupuncture has long been used in China to clinically treat stroke. However, the precise mechanism of its neuroprotective activities remains largely unknown. Using a focal cerebral I/R injured rat model, in the present study we evaluated the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of electroacupuncture and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that electroacupuncture at Quchi (LI11) and Zusanli (ST36) acupoints on the contralateral paralyzed limb significantly improved neurological deficits and cerebral infarction. In addition, electroacupuncture profoundly activated PI3K/Akt signaling in ischemic cerebral tissues. Consequently, the upregulatory effect of electroacupuncture on PI3K/Akt activation resulted in the inhibition of cerebral cell apoptosis. Moreover, electroacupuncture increased the serum secretion levels of the PI3K activators BDNF and GDNF, as well as upregulated the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bax ratio in ischemic cerebrum. Our data suggest that electroacupuncture at Quchi and Zusanli acupoints exerts neuroprotective function in ischemic stroke via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

22692332|t|Early menopause predicts future coronary heart disease and stroke: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
22692332|a|OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of women. Identifying women at risk of cardiovascular disease has tremendous public health importance. Early menopause is associated with increased cardiovascular disease events in some predominantly white populations, but not consistently. Our objective was to determine if self-reported early menopause (menopause at an age <46 y) identifies women as at risk for future coronary heart disease or stroke. METHODS: The study population came from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a longitudinal, ethnically diverse cohort study of US men and women aged 45 to 84 years enrolled in 2000-2002 and followed up until 2008. The association between a personal history of early menopause (either natural menopause or surgical removal of ovaries at an age <46 y) and future coronary heart disease and stroke was assessed in 2,509 women (ages 45-84 y; 987 white, 331 Chinese, 641 black, and 550 Hispanic) from the Multi-ethnic Study Atherosclerosis who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. RESULTS: Of 2,509 women, 693 (28%) reported either surgical or natural early menopause. In survival curves, women with early menopause had worse coronary heart disease and stroke-free survival (log rank P = 0.008 and P = 0.0158). In models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, Multi-ethnic Study Atherosclerosis site, and traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, this risk for coronary heart disease and stroke remained (hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.17-3.70; and hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.11-4.32, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Early menopause is positively associated with coronary heart disease and stroke in a multiethnic cohort, independent of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors.

24082627|t|In vivo pharmacokinetic comparisons of ferulic acid and puerarin after oral administration of monomer, medicinal substance aqueous extract and Nao-De-Sheng to rats.
24082627|a|BACKGROUND: Nao-De-Sheng decoction (NDS), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription containing Radix puerariae lobatae, Floscarthami, Radix et Rhizoma Notoginseng, Rhizoma chuanxiong and Fructus crataegi, is effective in the treatment of cerebral arteriosclerosis, ischemic cerebral stroke and apoplexy linger effect. Ferulic acid and puerarin are the main absorbed effective ingredients of NDS. OBJECTIVE: To assess the affection of other components in medical material and compound recipe compatibility on the pharmacokinetics of ferulaic acid and puerarin, of ferulic acid from the monomer Rhizoma chuanxiong aqueous extract and NDS were studied. And pharmacokinetics comparisons of puerarin from the monomer Radix puerariae extract and NDS decoction were investigated simultaneously. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At respective different time points after oral administration of the monomer, medicinal substance aqueous extract and NDS at the same dose in rats, plasma concentrations of ferulic acid and puerarin in rats were determined by RP-HPLC, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated with 3P97 software. RESULTS: The plasma concentration-time curves of ferulaic acid and puerarin were both best fitted with a two-compartment model. AUC0-t , AUC0→∞, T max, and C max of ferulic acid in the monomer and NDS decoction were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with that in Rhizoma chuanxiong aqueous extract. And statistically signiﬁcant increase (P < 0.05) in pharmacokinetic parameters of puerarin including AUC0-t , AUC0→∞, CL, T max and C max were obtained after oral administration of puerarin monomer compared with Radix puerariae extract. Although the changes of AUC0-t , AUC0→∞ and CL had no statistically significant, C max of puerarin in NDS was increased remarkably (P < 0.05) compared with that in single puerarin. CONCLUSIONS: Some ingredients of Rhizoma chuanxiong and Radix puerariae may be suggested to remarkably influence plasma concentrations of ferulaic acid and puerarin. Some ingredients in NDS may increase dissolution and absorption of ferulaic acid and puerarin, delay elimination, and subsequently enhance bioavailability of ferulaic acid and puerarin in rats after compatibility.

22972087|t|Acupuncture for insomnia.
22972087|a|BACKGROUND: Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure.Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high-quality clinical trials are required.

23297552|t|Randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled clinical trial on correspondence of prescriptions and traditional Chinese medicine syndrome of ischemic stroke.
23297552|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of correspondence of prescriptions and the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome of ischemic stroke. METHODS: Based on standard syndrome diagnosis and a series of effective formulas, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled clinical trial on correspondence of prescriptions and the TCM syndrome of ischemic stroke was conducted. The formulas were dynamically changed according to the patient's TCM syndrome. RESULTS: The treatment was composed of a series of formulas changed daily according to the TCM syndrome. Treatments which were composed of a series of formulas had similar short-term (1 month after onset) effects in improving mild and moderate neurological deficits compared with treatments composed of only one formula. However, patients treated with a series of formulas showed improved subjective symptoms in the short-term and a decreased risk of stroke recurrence within three months after onset. CONCLUSION: Complete (series of formulas) and incomplete (only one formula) correspondence of prescriptions and TCM syndrome have similar effects on the central clinical manifestation of ischemic stroke, such as neurological deficit and activities in daily living. However, they have significant differences regarding individual dysfunctions, such as subjective symptoms.

22659084|t|Activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels as an element of the neuroprotective effects of the Traditional Chinese Medicine MLC901 against oxygen glucose deprivation.
22659084|a|NeuroAid (MLC601 and MLC901), a Traditional Medicine used in China for patients after stroke has been reported in preclinical models of ischemia to induce neuroprotection and neuroplasticity. This work shows the effects of MLC901 on an in vitro model of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). MLC901 prevents neuronal death induced by 120 min OGD and decreases the exaggerated Ca²⁺ entry in mature cortical neurons exposed to 120 min OGD. The neuroprotective effect of MLC901 is associated with a large hyperpolarization of ∼20 mV which is antagonized by glibenclamide, the specific inhibitor of K(ATP) channels. In addition MLC901 strengthens the activation of K(ATP) channels. MLC901 has been directly shown to act as an activator of K(ATP) channels as potent as the classical K(ATP) channel opener. The capacity of MLC901 to produce a large hyperpolarization, particularly in neurons that have suffered from energy deprivation probably plays an important role in the neuroprotective effects of this traditional medicine that comes in addition to its previously demonstrated neuroregenerative properties.

22979929|t|[Study on the correlation between traditional Chinese medicine syndrome and short-term prognosis of ischemic stroke using logistic regression model and repeated-measures analysis of variance].
22979929|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome and short-term prognosis of ischemic stroke. METHODS: TCM syndrome factors and the neurological deficit degree of 464 patients with ischemic stroke were assessed using the Ischemic Stroke TCM Syndrome Factor Diagnostic Scale (ISTSFDS) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on the 1st, 7th and 14th day from the onset of ischemic stroke. Patients were assigned to the favorable short-term prognosis group and the unfavorable short-term prognosis group, depending on the NIHSS score on the 14th day after onset of stroke. The correlation between TCM syndrome factors and the short-term prognosis of ischemic stroke was studied using the logistic regression model. Then, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predicting capacity of logistic regression mode. Lastly, according to the results of the logistic regression model, the authors investigated the correlation between blood stasis syndrome and the neurological deficit degree of stroke with application of repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Blood stasis syndrome (odds ratio=2.924, 95% confidence interval from 1.231 to 6.946, P=0.015) on the 14th day and NISSS score (odds ratio=1.956, 95% confidence interval from 1.701 to 2.250, P=0.000) on the 1st day after onset of stroke were risk factors that could predict short-term prognosis of ischemic stroke. The area under the ROC curves of the logistic regression model was 0.95. There was a tendency for stroke patients with blood stasis syndrome to have higher NIHSS scores than patients without blood stasis syndrome, and there was a decreased NIHSS score with time points delay. CONCLUSION: Blood stasis syndrome is a risk whose diagnosis could predict short-term prognosis of ischemic stroke. Clinically, the application of treatment focusing on activating blood and resolving stasis can improve the short-term prognosis of stroke patients. This study provides an evidence base for dynamic intervention of a comprehensive integrative medical treatment program based on syndrome differentiation for ischemic stroke.

22855032|t|Several considerations in using traditional Chinese patent medicine for cerebral infarction.
22855032|a|Nowadays, a great number of traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM) are used more and more widely to treat cerebral infarction in China. When great attention is paid to using TCPM in the real world, several problems can be identified: ignoring the Chinese medicine (CM) therapeutic principle based on syndrome differentiation, a lack of appropriate dosage and usage based on individual patient conditions, and a shortage of evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Furthermore, in terms of evaluation of the TCPM effectiveness, few comprehensive criteria and evaluation methods recognized by the international community exist. This article addresses some opinions regarding the above mentioned problems.

23672224|t|Assessment of methodological quality and outcome measures of acute stroke randomized controlled trials in China in recent 15 years.
23672224|a|BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the most important evidence to guide clinical practice in the treatment of acute stroke. This study aims to evaluate the changes of quantity and methodological quality of acute stroke RCTs in Mainland China published in recent 15 years. METHOD: We included un-confounded RCTs on acute stroke from eight databases published in Chinese or English from 1996 to 2010. General characteristics, design methodology, and outcome measures of studies were assessed. RESULTS: Totally, 9061 RCTs were identified. The number of acute stroke RCTs had increased by years, the total of trials published in 2010 was 20 times of that published in 1996. Three thousand four hundred eighty-eight trials (38.5%) used western drugs in the treatment, 3026 (33.4%) trials used traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and 1933 (22.0%) trials used physical therapy. Ischemic stroke was the most common research subject among all trials (65.1%, 5,989). There were 541 (6.0%) RCTs using adequate randomization methods, 34 (0.4%) RCTs using adequate allocation concealment, and 195 (2.2%) using adequate blinding methods. Thirty-three (0.4%) RCTs adopted both adequate randomization methods and allocation concealment. Only 23 (0.3%) trials used all three methods of adequate randomization methods, allocation concealment, and blinding. During the 15 years, only the number of trials using adequate randomized methods and reporting adverse events had significantly increased (both P < 0.001). As for these RCTs, only the number of trials using adequate blinding method in pharmaceutical intervention was statistical differences compared with that of nondrug intervention trials (P = 0.043). Outcomes were assessed blindly in 72 trials. Death was reported by 14.2% of trials, impairment by 85.1%, disability by 22.5%, and handicap or quality of life by 0.4%. 99.7% trials reported positive results. Larger trials were more likely to use adequate randomized methods, allocation concealment and blinding methods, as well as to measure disability. Only 14 large-sample high-quality RCTs were found. CONCLUSION: During 15 years, the number of acute stroke RCTs has increased dramatically, but the quality of trials improves slowly. Most acute stroke trials used inadequate outcome measures in terms of their content, reliability, validity, blinding assessment.

22431378|t|Therapeutic effects of tetramethylpyrazine nitrone in rat ischemic stroke models.
22431378|a|Free radical-mediated neuronal cell damage is an important pathological process in ischemic stroke. We have previously reported a novel dual-functional agent, 2-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)oxidoimino]-methyl]-3,5,6-trimethylpyrazine (TBN), a derivative of tetramethylpyrazine armed with anitrone moiety. In this report, we further evaluate TBN'stherapeutic parameters in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Its abilities to cross the blood-brain barrier, scavenge free radicals, and inhibit Ca(2+) influx were also investigated. TBN showed significant activity in both the transient MCAO (t-MCAO) and permanent MCAO (p-MCAO) stroke models in the rat. The therapeutic time window is 8 hr in the t-MCAO model. TBN readily crossed the blood-brain barrier and in vitro had strong activity in neutralizing ·OH, O(-)(2)·, and ONOO(-) and significantly decreased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. TBN is a promising new treatment forischemic stroke, with multiple mechanisms of action. It blocks Ca(2+) overload and neutralizes ·OH, O(-)(2)·, and ONOO(-).

22805083|t|[Chinese herbal medicine for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease based on syndrome differentiation: a randomized controlled trial].
22805083|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by its gradual progression. At present, the cause and mechanism of AD are yet unclear, and there is no effective therapy for treating it. With development of global aging, the prevalence rate of AD is increasing. The life quality of elderly people is affected severely by AD that is ultimately life-threatening. Recently, study on treating AD with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has deepened. OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effects of a syndrome differentiation-based TCM regime in treating patients with mild to moderate AD for improving cognition, and to evaluate the changes in brain function of AD patients observed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Adopting the internationally recognized criteria developed by National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association, the clinical trial was conducted on 131 patients with mild to moderate AD from 5 communities and 7 social welfare institutions. Participants were accepted after informed consent was received, and laboratory tests and a head imaging study were conducted. The patients were randomly divided into Chinese medicine group (CMG) (66 cases) or Western medicine group (WMG) (65 cases). Patients in the CMG were treated monthly with Chinese medicine according to syndrome differentiation. Patients in the WMG were treated with donepezil at a dose of 5 mg once daily. The therapeutic course lasted 48 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Fuld Object-Memory Evaluation (FOM), Block Design (BD) and Digit Span (DS) were used to evaluate the cognitive function; resting-state fMRI was used for observing brain function. The questionnaires and fMRI were performed before and after treatments. RESULTS: The cognitive functions of the patients in the CMG and WMG were improved after treatment. MMSE score was improved significantly in both groups (P<0.05 or P<0.001). After 48 weeks of treatment, 70.91% patients in the CMG had an improved MMSE score and 20% got worse, however, 55.77% patients in the WMG were improved in MMSE score and 34.62% got worse. Scores of FOM denominator and BD increased significantly in both groups; scores of FOM numerator and DS were also increased in the CMG (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The results of fMRI suggested that both Chinese medicine and donepezil treatment improved the connectivity between posterior cingulated gyrus and specific areas in the brain. The influence range of Chinese medicine primarily impacted on the left parietal lobe, being less than the influence range of donepezil, which primarily affected both sides of frontal lobes. CONCLUSION: TCM treatment based on syndrome differentiation is effective in improving cognitive function of patients with mild to moderate AD and increasing the brain function by increasing connectivity between posterior cingulated gyrus and specific areas in the brain.

22738270|t|Acupuncture regulates the glucose metabolism in cerebral functional regions in chronic stage ischemic stroke patients--a PET-CT cerebral functional imaging study.
22738270|a|BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been applied to aid in the recovery of post-stroke patients, but its mechanism is unclear. This study aims to analyze the relationship between acupuncture and glucose metabolism in cerebral functional regions in post-stroke patients using (18)FDG PET-CT techniques. Forty-three ischemic stroke patients were randomly divided into 5 groups: the Waiguan (TE5) needling group, the TE5 sham needling group, the sham point needling group, the sham point sham needling group and the non-needling group. Cerebral functional images of all patients were then acquired using PET-CT scans and processed by SPM2 software. RESULTS: Compared with the non-needling group, sham needling at TE5 and needling/sham needling at the sham point did not activate cerebral areas. However, needling at TE5 resulted in the activation of Brodmann Area (BA) 30. Needling/sham needling at TE5 and needling at the sham point did not deactivate any cerebral areas, whereas sham needling at the sham point led to deactivation in BA6. Compared with sham needling at TE5, needling at TE5 activated BA13, 19 and 47 and did not deactivate any areas. Compared with needling at the sham point, needling at TE5 had no associated activation but a deactivating effect on BA9. CONCLUSION: Needling at TE5 had a regulating effect on cerebral functional areas shown by PET-CT, and this may relate to its impact on the recovery of post-stroke patients.

22579617|t|Novel multi-functional nitrones for treatment of ischemic stroke.
22579617|a|Ischemic stroke resulting from obstruction of blood vessels is an enormous public health problem with urgent need for effective therapy. The co-administration of thrombolytic/antiplatelet agent and neuroprotective agent improves therapeutic efficacy and agent possessing both thrombolytic/antiplatelet and antiradical activities provides a promising strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke. We have previously reported a novel compound, namely TBN, possessing both antiplatelet and antiradical activities, showed significant neuroprotective effect in a rat stroke model. We herein report synthesis of a series of new pyrazine derivatives, and evaluation of their biological activities. Their mechanisms of action were also investigated. Among these new derivatives, compound 21, armed with two nitrone moieties, showed the greatest neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo. Compound 21 significantly inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In a cell free antiradical assay, compound 21 was the most effective agent in scavenging the three most damaging radicals, namely (·)OH, O(2)(·-) and ONOO(-).

22821656|t|Caffeic acid ester fraction from Erigeron breviscapus inhibits microglial activation and provides neuroprotection.
22821656|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of caffeic acid ester fraction (Caf) from Erigeron breviscapus, mainly composed of dicaffeoylquinic acids (diCQAs), on microglial activation in vitro and focal cerebral ischemia in vivo. METHODS: The production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in rat primary cultured microglia were measured by Griess reaction or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell viability of cortical neurons was measured using AlamarBlue reagent. The behavioral tests and the infarct area of brain were used to evaluate the damage to central nervous system in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of cerebral ischemia. Real time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA in ischemic cerebral tissues. RESULTS: Caf inhibited the production of NO, TNF-α and IL-1β induced by LPS treatment in primary microglia in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure of cortical neurons to conditioned medium from Caf-treated microglia increased neuronal cell viability (P<0.01) compared with conditioned medium from LPS-treated alone. In MCAO rat model of cerebral ischemia, Caf could significantly improve neurobehavioural performance and reduce percentage infarct volume compared with the vehicle group (P<0.05). Caf could also significantly inhibit the up-regulation of iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-1β gene expressions in ischemic cerebral tissues. CONCLUSION: Caf could suppress microglial activation, which may be one mechanism of its neuroprotective effect against ischemia.

22876459|t|Potential advantages of a combination of chinese medicine and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation for removing blood stasis and stimulating neogenesis during ischemic stroke treatment.
22876459|a|Combined treatment of ischemic stroke with Chinese medicine and exogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation may improve the removal of blood stasis and stimulation of neogenesis. Chinese medicines that remove blood stasis not only promote blood circulation but also calm the endopathic wind, remove heat, resolve phlegm, remove toxic substances and strengthen body resistance. The medicinal targeting effect of Chinese medicine can promote the homing of BMSCs, and the synergistic therapeutic effects of drugs can contribute to BMSC differentiation. As such, exogenous BMSC transplantation has potential advantages for neogenesis. Chinese medicines and exogenous BMSCs provide complementary functions for the removal of blood stasis and tion of Chinese medicine and transplantation of exogenous BMSCs may be particularly suited to ischemic stroke treatment.

22876439|t|Mortality and recurrence of vascular disease among stroke patients treated with combined TCM therapy.
22876439|a|OBJECTIVE: To confirm the long-term outcomes of stroke patients and determine predicting factors for death, recurrence of vascular events and poor outcome (either recurrence or death) after the use of combined TCM therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective hospital-based cohort study and was performed in the First Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Tianjin. All subjects with stroke consecutively admitted to an inpatient ward of the Acupuncture Department from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2008 were retrospectively followed through one year. The main outcomes were either a recurrence of vascular events, mortality or both. Risk factors were recorded from medical records. Multivariate regression models were used to analyze predictors. The following independent variables were used: age, gender, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, carotid arterial lesions and history of stroke. RESULTS: Four-hundred and five patients were included. The 1-year mortality rate was 11.11%. 23.70% of the patients had a recurrent vascular event, and 30.86% suffered a poor outcome. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that previous stroke, and advanced age were predictors of death within one year, Recurrence of vascular events was associated with carotid arterial lesions, history of diabetes and previous stroke. Long-term poor outcome was predicted by advanced age, history of diabetes, and previous stroke. CONCLUSION: Age, previous stroke, carotid arterial lesions and diabetes history seem to have different impacts on the three outcomes within one year. Our findings provide important data for planning future hospital register studies of stroke patients in TCM hospitals.

24761164|t|Does Syndrome Differentiation Matter? A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials in Cochrane Reviews of Acupuncture.
24761164|a|BACKGROUND: One of the basic and important principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine theory is syndrome differentiation, which is widely utilized for individual diagnosis and in the application of acupuncture treatment. However, the impact of syndrome differentiation on therapeutic effect is unclear because of insufficient supportive clinical evidence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze current Cochrane Database systematic reviews of acupuncture and to evaluate differences in therapeutic effects of acupuncture treatment when syndrome differentiation is utilized, compared to when this approach is not utilized. METHODS: Cochrane Database systematic reviews of acupuncture were included if the reviews had sufficient data to perform subgroup analyses by syndrome differentiation applied during acupoints' selection. Searching was conducted across all available articles of the Cochrane Library, and the search concluded in July 2011. RESULTS: Forty-four trials from five Cochrane reviews were included in 10 subgroup meta-analyses. Seven meta-analyses showed that there were no differences between trials using fixed acupoints prescriptions and trials using individualized treatment based on relevant symptom improvements in cases of acute stroke, depression, epilepsy, migraine, and peripheral joint osteoarthritis (OA). The remaining 3 meta-analyses showed that acupuncture with fixed prescriptions was superior to individualized acupuncture for pain relief of peripheral joint OA, compared to sham control. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence showed no significant difference between acupuncture treatment with or without syndrome differentiation. Large, well-designed trials are warranted to address the use of syndrome differentiation for specific diseases or conditions in order to confirm if there are any advantages of using syndrome differentiation to achieve better therapeutic effects with acupuncture.

22387241|t|Integrated pharmacokinetics of major bioactive components in MCAO rats after oral administration of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang.
22387241|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT, or Oren-gedoku-to in Japanese), an important multi-herb remedy in China and other Asia countries, has been used clinically to treat cerebral ischemia for decades. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the previous studies we have reported, an HPLC method was developed and validated for determination of berberine, palmatine, baicalin, baicalein and geniposide simultaneously in MCAO rat plasma after administration of HLJDT aqueous extract. A classified integral pharmacokinetic method was put forward after having compared the integrated concentration-time profile with that of single component. An AUC based weighting approach was used for integrated principle. RESULTS: The results indicated the classified integral pharmacokinetic profile of index components from HLJDT could reveal the pharmacokinetic behavior of original components, and was corresponding to the holistic pharmacological effects of anti-ischemia with HLJDT. CONCLUSIONS: This study was aimed to explore an approach that could be applied to integrate the pharmacokinetic behavior of different components derived from HLJDT. The integrated pharmacokinetic results also provided more information for further understanding of the clinical cerebrovascular disease in use of HLJDT.

22366434|t|Tong Luo Jiu Nao injection, a traditional Chinese medicinal preparation, inhibits MIP-1β expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells injured by oxygen-glucose deprivation.
22366434|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tong Luo Jiu Nao injection (TLJN), a modern Chinese formula based on Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, has been used to treat ischemic stroke and vascular dementia. TLJN belongs to the ethnopharmacological family of medicines. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the protective effect of TLJN on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induced-injury of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The model of OGD was established in the primarily cultured BMECs. TLJN was added to the OGD-injured BMECs for 6h. A series of assays were used to detect the effects of TLJN on: (i) MIP-1β content in BMECs conditioned media (CM) by ELISA; (ii) MIP-1β protein expression in BMECs by western blotting and immunocytochemistry; (iii) the expression of CCR5, receptor of MIP-1β, in BMECs by western blotting; (iv) the proliferative activity of microglial cells via the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). RESULTS: Our results showed that the OGD-injured BMECs presented with large amounts of secretion and expression of MIP-1β and up-regulation of CCR5. Also, the CM of OGD-injured BMECs remarkably increased the proliferative activity of microglial cells. The TLJN-treated BMECs exhibited a reduction of MIP-1β content in BMECs-CM and a down-regulation of MIP-1β and CCR5 expression. In addition, an inhibitory effect of CM of OGD-injured plus TLJN injection-treated BMECs on microglial proliferation was also found. CONCLUSION: TLJN reduced the expression of MIP-1β and CCR5 in OGD-injured BMECs, and the CM of OGD-injured plus TLJN injection-treated BMECs inhibited the proliferative activity of microglial cells, suggesting the therapeutic potential of TLJN on ischemic cerebral vascular disease.

22875557|t|An effectiveness study comparing acupuncture, physiotherapy, and their combination in poststroke rehabilitation: a multicentered, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
22875557|a|CONTEXT: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, being the third leading cause of death in the United States and the second and third most common causes of death in Chinese cities and rural areas, respectively. Evaluation of different rehabilitative modalities appears necessary to optimize treatment. OBJECTIVES: To compare acupuncture and physiotherapy for effectiveness and reliability in treating hemiplegic patients after stroke. DESIGN: The research team designed a multicentered, three-arm, randomized controlled trial. Power calculations revealed a targeted sample size of 310 participants. SETTING: The study took place at seven in-patient hospitals in China. PARTICIPANTS: The research team screened a total of 310 patients. Of that number, 274 completed the study, 15 did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 21 dropped out. Adverse events were rare (less than 1%), mild, and temporary. INTERVENTION: The research team randomly divided participants into three groups that all received conventional care as needed-including psychological counseling, standard nursing care, and daily medical evaluation plus (1) acupuncture, (2) physiotherapy, or (3) acupuncture plus physiotherapy. The participants received treatments once a day, 6 days a week for 4 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team evaluated all patients at baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 4 weeks using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Physical Performance (FMA), a modified Barthel Index (BI), and the Neurologic Defect Scale (NDS). RESULTS: No significant differences existed between the three groups at baseline. Compared to baseline, participants in all groups improved their FMA, BI, and NDS scores by the end of week 2 (P≤.05) and further improved by the end of week 4 (P≤.05) The study found no statistically significant differences in outcomes between the three groups after treatment (P>.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture plus conventional care was similar in effectiveness to physiotherapy treatment plus conventional care for poststroke rehabilitation. The study found no synergistic effects for the combination of acupuncture and physiotherapy in addition to conventional care; that combination of treatments was no more effective than either treatment by itself. The effectiveness and lack of adverse events associated with acupuncture in this study suggest that it may represent an additional treatment option for stroke patients.

22426799|t|Clinical study on tongyan spray for post-stroke dysphagia patients: a randomized controlled trial.
22426799|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effectiveness and safety of Tongyan spray composed of Chinese medicine for post-stroke dysphagia patients. METHOD: One hundred and twenty-two post-stroke dysphagia patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group (61 cases) and the control group (61 cases). Basic treatment was given to both groups, with Tongyan spray additionally used in oropharynx for the treatment group, and the placebo used for the control group. After 28-day treatment, the clinical effect and safety were evaluated according to the standard swallowing assessment (SSA) scale. RESULTS: One patient dropped out in each group, and 120 patients reached the final analysis of the study. The total effective rate for the treatment group was 71.7% (43/60), higher than 46.7% (28/60) in the control group (P<0.05), and the improvement on SSA scores of the two groups were significantly different after treatment (P<0.05). For grade 1 dysphagia patients (completely depending on nasogastric tube), the effective rate of the treatment group was 40.9% (9/22), and 12.5% (2/16) of the control group, without significant difference (P>0.05), while the improvement of SSA score was significantly different between the two groups after treatment (P<0.05). For grade 2-3 dysphagia patients (oral and nasogastric tube feeding), the total effective rate of the treatment group was 89.5% (34/38), higher than 59.1% (26/44) in the control group (P<0.05), and also the improvement on SSA scores was significantly different between the two groups after treatment (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Tongyan spray was an effective and safe method for post-stroke dysphagia patients.

22465277|t|Simultaneous determination and pharmacokinetics of protein unbound aspirin and salicylic acid in rat blood and brain by microdialysis: an application to herbal-drug interaction.
22465277|a|Aspirin is commonly used for the prevention of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke; whereas the Chinese people employ the bu-yang-huan-wu-tang (BYHWT) as a routine herbal formulation for the treatment and prevention of transient ischemic stroke. The current study develops a microdialysis technique coupled to a validated liquid chromatography system to measure free-form aspirin and salicylic acid for herbal-drug interaction in rat blood and brain. The intra- and inter-day precisions in biological dialysates were within 0.1-9.4% in the concentration ranges of 0.1-50 μg/mL and the accuracies ranged from -4.7 to 6.1%. The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of the aspirin was 2031 ± 266 min μg/mL after aspirin administration (100mg/kg, i.v.). The AUC of salicylic acid was 12660 ± 1799 min μg/mL, which suggests that aspirin is quickly hydrolyzed to salicylic acid in blood and the metabolite can also be detected within 15 min in brain dialysate. The herbal-drug pharmacokinetic interaction showed no significant effect in blood and brain. The results of pharmacodynamics for the bleeding time suggested that there were no significant differences between the aspirin alone group and the BYHWT pretreated group. However, the bleeding time has been prolonged when compared aspirin alone or the group pretreated with BYHWT to the blank control. The conclusion provides practical information for clinical practice for the herbal formulation BYHWT and aspirin used concurrently.

22668677|t|Acupuncture for stroke: evidence of effectiveness, safety, and cost from systematic reviews.
22668677|a|OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analysis on the effectiveness, safety, and cost of acupuncture for stroke. METHODS: Two authors selected the articles according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 2 authors extracted data from the reviews. Potentially relevant systematic reviews were searched through the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CISCOM, Chinese Biological Medicine Database (CBMD), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), Chinese periodicals in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Database. The evidence was based on the reviews and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine articles were indentified: 1 focused on acute stroke; 1 focused on subacute or chronic stroke; 5 focused on stroke (the interval after stroke onset was variable in these studies); and 2 addressed dysphagia after stroke. There is a split among reviewers regarding the effectiveness of acupuncture for stroke recovery. The most reliable evidence showed that there was no clear benefit of acupuncture for stroke patients in acute, subacute, or chronic stages. There was not a single economic analysis of acupuncture for treatment of stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture treatment seems to be relatively safe. The evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture for stroke was inconclusive, mainly due to poor methodological quality and small samples. For future research, further high-quality, randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed, as well as economic analysis.

22587973|t|[Acupuncture treatment programs for post-stroke motor rehabilitation in community hospitals: study protocol of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial].
22587973|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is responsible for increasingly high rates of mortality and disability worldwide. Approximately two million people suffer from stroke for the first time in China each year. The high incidence (50%) of post-stroke disability brings a heavy burden to patients and their caregivers. Acupuncture has been widely used in the communities for post-stroke rehabilitation in China. The objective of this trial is to apply our acupuncture research achievement to treatment and evaluation of post-stroke hemiplegic patients in community. METHODS AND DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial will be performed in Longhua Hospital and a number of community health service centers in Shanghai. A total of 124 patients (estimated sample size) with post-stroke hemiplegia will be randomly divided into an acupuncture group and a control group. The patients undergoing randomization should be stratified according to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at baseline. Within the acupuncture group, different acupuncture protocols are administered to patients with flaccid paralysis or spastic paralysis based on the Ashworth Scale. Patients in the acupuncture group will also be treated with comprehensive rehabilitation therapy. The control group will be treated with comprehensive rehabilitation therapy only. The primary outcome measures are the Simplified Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale, the Modified Barthel Index, and the Burden of Stroke Scale. Secondary outcome measures are the modified Rankin Scale, the modified Ashworth Scale and the Stroke Scale of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Outcome measures will be performed after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The patients will be followed up after 6 months. DISCUSSION: The results of this study are expected to demonstrate that our standardized acupuncture protocol for treating and evaluating post-stroke hemiplegic patients will improve motor function and lessen the burden of post-stroke patients within the communities. This will provide the evidence to support successful translation of acupuncture therapy for post-stroke hemiplegic patients in community hospital use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry with the registration number ChiCTR-TRC-11001347.

22587925|t|[A controlled study on the treatment of acute progressive cerebral infarction by continuous anticoagulation with small doses of heparin].
22587925|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the treatment of acute progressive cerebral infarction by continuous anticoagulation with small doses of heparin. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical research was conducted. Three hundred and fifty-one patients were randomly divided into three groups. Group A (n=119) was treated with heparin, which was controlled by an infusion pump with a speed of 18 U×kg(-1)×h(-1) for 24 hours, and the dosage was regulated according to the changes in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) which was determined every 8 hours. Group B (n=115) was treated with intravenous drip of 12,500 U of heparin with a speed of 18 U×kg(-1)×h(-1) once a day. Group C (n=117) was treated with 5000 U of low-molecular-weight heparin calcium injection twice a day. After 14 days, nerve function defect according to the National Institutes of Heath stroke scale (NIHSS) score was determined, the adverse events (e.g. intracranial hemorrhage, subcutaneous ecchymosis, gingival bleeding, hematuria and occult blood in stools) were observed. After 6 months, the recurrence rate and Barthel index (BI) would be determined. RESULTS: The total efficiency in group A (95.80%) was significantly higher than that in group B (85.22%) and group C (85.47%). Recurrence rate in group A (1.68%) was significantly lower than group B (8.70%) and group C (8.33%) with significant differences (P<0.05 or P<0.01), while there was no significant difference between group B and group C (both P>0.05). The BI of group A (89.27±8.56) was significantly higher than group B (72.57±9.77) and group C (71.66±9.37) with significant difference (both P<0.01), while there was no significant difference between group B and group C (P>0.05). Adverse event rate in group A (5.88%) was slightly higher than that of group B (3.48%) and group C (4.27%), but the difference was not significant (both P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of low dosage of heparin could significantly reduce neurologic impairment score in patients with progressive cerebral infarction, increase cure rate, reduce the recurrence rate, and raise the BI of patients, and it dose not increase the risk of intracranial and extracranial hemorrhage.

22679720|t|[The superiorities of applying comprehensive medical model in treating stroke in Chinese medicine hospitals].
22679720|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical effectiveness of applying comprehensive medical model in treating stroke in Chinese medicine (CM) hospitals. METHODS: Totally 236 stroke inpatients were randomly assigned to the comprehensive treatment group (as the experimental group, 121 cases) and the conventional treatment group (as the control group, 115 cases). A standard comprehensive treatment mode was applied in the experimental group. The Chinese materia medica (CMM) or acupuncture was combined during the rehabilitation treatment. Traditional basic drug treatment method was applied in the conventional treatment group. The health education for patients and their families was launched non-systematically. The mortality, the occurrence rate of complications, short-term clinical effectiveness, as well as NIHSS, Barthel index (BI), and Oxford Handicap Scale (OHS) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Before treatment there was no statistical difference in NIHSS score, BI, or OHS score between the two groups (P > 0.05). On day 21 and 90 of the treatment, there was statistical difference in NIHSS score, BI, and OHS score (P < 0.01). Better results were obtained in the experimental group. On day 21 and 90 of the treatment, the total effectiveness rate was 80.99% and 88.43% in the experimental group, higher than that of the control group (61.74% and 72.17% respectively), showing statistical difference (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The occurrence rate of common complications in the experimental group was obviously lower than that in the control group (30.58% vs 69.56%, P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the mortality between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of the comprehensive medical model in treating stroke in CM showed better effects than using traditional basic drug treatment method. Treatment of stroke by CM showed superiorities.

22536937|t|Reliability and validity of the Korean Standard Pattern Identification for Stroke (K-SPI-Stroke) questionnaire.
22536937|a|BACKGROUND: The present study was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of the 'Korean Standard Pattern Identification for Stroke (K-SPI-Stroke)', which was developed and evaluated within the context of traditional Korean medicine (TKM). METHODS: Between September 2006 and December 2010, 2,905 patients from 11 Korean medical hospitals were asked to complete the K-SPI-Stroke questionnaire as a part of project ' Fundamental study for the standardization and objectification of pattern identification in traditional Korean medicine for stroke (SOPI-Stroke). Each patient was independently diagnosed by two TKM physicians from the same site according to one of four patterns, as suggested by the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine: 1) a Qi deficiency pattern, 2) a Dampness-phlegm pattern, 3) a Yin deficiency pattern, or 4) a Fire-heat pattern. We estimated the internal consistency using Cronbach's α coefficient, the discriminant validity using the means score of patterns, and the predictive validity using the classification accuracy of the K-SPI-Stroke questionnaire. RESULTS: The K-SPI-Stroke questionnaire had satisfactory internal consistency (α = 0.700) and validity, with significant differences in the mean of scores among the four patterns. The overall classification accuracy of this questionnaire was 65.2 %. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the K-SPI-Stroke questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for estimating the severity of the four patterns.

22338645|t|Exploring practice characteristics and research priorities of practitioners of traditional acupuncture in China and the EU-A survey.
22338645|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Acupuncture practice is based on the theoretical, historical and philosophical principles, which are part of Chinese medicine. Traditional acupuncture practitioners assess their patients' conditions using Chinese medicine diagnostic techniques, which determine clinical care and treatment. Little is known about differences in the perceptions of research evidence among practitioners in the European Union (EU) and China, given the diversity of acupuncture practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study explored differences between practitioners of traditional acupuncture regarding perceived need for research evidence and prioritisation for future clinical trials, based on their practice within the EU and China. A convenience sample of acupuncturists in the EU (contacted by their professional organisation) and China (from geographically dispersed hospitals) were invited to participate in a survey, which was conducted during 2010/2011. Data collected included: practitioners' demographic details, country of training, practice setting, acupuncture techniques, perceived adverse event reporting, diagnostic methods, conditions commonly treated, conditions perceived as needing more evidence and practitioner perceptions of conditions which could demonstrate benefit if investigated in clinical trials. RESULTS: From 1126 survey responses, 1020 (559 EU, 461 China) could be included in the analysis for direct comparison. A response rate for the EU could not be calculated but for China was 98%. Pain was the most frequently reported commonly treated condition by EU acupuncturists and neurological conditions (mainly stroke) for Chinese practitioners. The top reported priorities for research were obstetrics/gynaecological conditions in the EU and neurological problems in China. CONCLUSION: The survey identified differences in practice and training between acupuncturists in China and the EU and between EU member states. These differences may inform prioritisation of health conditions for future trials. Innovative research methods are recommended to incorporate the complexity and plurality of acupuncture practice and theory. Creation of collaborative networks is crucial in overcoming these differences to facilitate international, multi-centre clinical trials.

22370143|t|Ameliorative effects of diammonium glycyrrhizinate on inflammation in focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury.
22370143|a|The present study investigated the neuroprotective potential of Diammonium Glycyrrhizinate (DG) in focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury in mice. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of the mouse was used. Mice were treated with DG (20mg/kg per day, intraperitoneal injection) or saline as control, from the beginning of the reperfusion to 7 days. The focal cerebral IR injury resulted in significant neurological deficits, infarct size, and brain water content (BWC) at 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after MCAO. A significant increase in various inflammatory mediators like interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was also observed in the IR challenged brains. The DG treatment significantly improved neurofunction, decreased infarct size, and suppressed edema in the focal cerebral IR injury. The neuroprotective effect of DG was found to be associated with significant reduction in the IL-1, TNF-α, COX-2, iNOS, NF-κB and GFAP levels. In summary, this study suggested that DG has a neuroprotective effect on cerebral IR injury and this effect is likely related to DG's anti-inflammatory function.

22306289|t|Neuroprotective effect of Buyang Huanwu decoction against focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats--time window and mechanism.
22306289|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Buyang Huanwu Decoction, a traditional Chinese medicine, consists of different herbal medicines, and has been traditionally used for centuries to treat paralysis and stroke. However, its optimal therapeutic time window and the mechanism are still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was designed to explore the therapeutic time window and mechanism of Buyang Huanwu Decoction on transient focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion was conducted in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and 40g/kg of Buyang Huanwu Decoction was intragastrically infused at different time points, and the same dose was infused every 24h for 3 days. The level of glutamate in cerebrospinal fluid and the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 RNA in striatum were detected before, during, and after ischemia/reperfusion. Neurological deficit scores and brain infarction volumes were measured at 72h after reperfusion. RESULT: Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion resulted in significant neurological deficit and extensive cerebral infarct volume, associated with a large amount of glutamate in cerebrospinal fluid and elevation of metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 RNA expression. Buyang Huanwu Decoction significantly suppressed the release of glutamate, and reduced the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 RNA. The neurological defect score and infarction volume were significantly improved by administration of Buyang Huanwu Decoction, when compared with the Ischemia group. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of Buyang Huanwu Decoction, within 4h of post-transient focal stroke, reduced significant cerebral ischemia/reperfusion damage. The neuroprotective mechanism of Buyang Huanwu Decoction is, in part, associated with the down-regulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 RNA and inhibition of glutamate release resulting from cerebral ischemia.

22400712|t|Comparative effectiveness research on patients with acute ischemic stroke using Markov decision processes.
22400712|a|BACKGROUND: Several methodological issues with non-randomized comparative clinical studies have been raised, one of which is whether the methods used can adequately identify uncertainties that evolve dynamically with time in real-world systems. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of different combinations of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments and combinations of TCM and Western medicine interventions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) by using Markov decision process (MDP) theory. MDP theory appears to be a promising new method for use in comparative effectiveness research. METHODS: The electronic health records (EHR) of patients with AIS hospitalized at the 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine between May 2005 and July 2008 were collected. Each record was portioned into two "state-action-reward" stages divided by three time points: the first, third, and last day of hospital stay. We used the well-developed optimality technique in MDP theory with the finite horizon criterion to make the dynamic comparison of different treatment combinations. RESULTS: A total of 1504 records with a primary diagnosis of AIS were identified. Only states with more than 10 (including 10) patients' information were included, which gave 960 records to be enrolled in the MDP model. Optimal combinations were obtained for 30 types of patient condition. CONCLUSION: MDP theory makes it possible to dynamically compare the effectiveness of different combinations of treatments. However, the optimal interventions obtained by the MDP theory here require further validation in clinical practice. Further exploratory studies with MDP theory in other areas in which complex interventions are common would be worthwhile.

24278807|t|Review of clinical applications of scalp acupuncture for paralysis: an excerpt from chinese scalp acupuncture.
24278807|a|Chinese scalp acupuncture is a contemporary acupuncture technique integrating traditional Chinese needling methods with Western medical knowledge of representative areas of the cerebral cortex. It has been proven to be a most effective technique for treating acute and chronic central nervous system disorders. Scalp acupuncture often produces remarkable results with just a few needles and usually brings about immediate improvement, sometimes taking only several seconds to a minute. Acupuncture, a therapeutic technique of Oriental Medicine, can be traced back more than 2500 years. Throughout its long history, acupuncture has evolved as its own unique traditional medicine. By embracing newly developed knowledge and technology, the profession continues to create additional methods of treatment. Techniques such as electrical and laser acupuncture and even new acupuncture points are currently being developed. We believe scalp acupuncture, which integrates Western medicine with Traditional Chinese Medicine, to be the most significant development that Chinese acupuncture has made in the past 60 years.

22594112|t|Influence of acupuncture on neural movement function in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion--a randomized controlled trial.
22594112|a|OBJECTIVES: To observe recovery in movement function in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) after acupuncture treatment. METHODS: According to the randomized and controlled principle 1384 rats were divided into the basic control group (including the normal, sham, model control, model without intervention, Nimodipine, and para-Renzhong groups) and the acupuncture group (including the Neiguan (PC 6), Weizhong (BL 40), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Chize (LU 5), Renzhong (GV 6) and non-acupoint groups). MCAO was modeled by Zea-longa's thread ligation and rats with scores of 1-3, as assessed by Zausinger's six-point method, were used in this study. Moreover, in the acupuncture group each acupoint was set with 12 different parameters by the orthogonal intersection method, resulting in 78 groups with 18 rats per group. The rats were treated by acupuncture once every 12 h for a total of six sessions and neurobehavioral scores were measured after each session. The neurobehavioral scores were compared by one-way ANOVA using the statistical software SPSS 17.0. RESULTS: After acupuncture therapy the mean neurobehavioral scores in MCAO rats increased gradually at each time point with a significant difference among the six scores, but with no significant differences between the fourth (48 h) and the fifth score (60 h), and between the fifth (60 h) and the sixth (72 h) score (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MCAO rats gradually recovered movement function over multiple acupuncture sessions. After the fouth acupuncture session (48 h), the neurobehavioral scores of rats with cerebral infarction remained stable. Acupuncture treatment had a reliable curative effect on movement function in cerebral infarction rats.

22594111|t|Effects of different frequencies of electro-acupuncture at shuigou (GV 26) on recovery of motor function in rats with focal cerebral ischemic injury.
22594111|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of different frequencies of electro-acupuncture at Shuigou (GV 26) on the latent period and wave amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in rats with focal cerebral infarction. METHODS: Fifty healthy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: controls, model, 2 Hz Shuigou, 50 Hz Shuigou and 100 Hz Shuigou. There were 10 rats in each group. Using a modification of a technique for middle cerebral artery occlusion, focal cerebral ischemic injury was induced in all rats except those in the control group. The rats in the control group received no treatment. After behavioral deficit had been evaluated using the Zausinger 6-point neurological function score, the rats in the Shuigou groups underwent acupuncture and continuous wave stimulation at a frequency of 2 Hz, 50 Hz or 100 Hz (intensity 1 mA) for 10 min twice daily for 3 days. The control and model groups underwent no intervention. Zausinger 6-point neurological function score and MEPs were measured 72 h after the start of treatment. RESULTS: The neurological function scores of the three Shuigou groups were significantly higher than those of the model group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between sides in the latency and amplitude of MEPs in the model group (P > 0.05). The latency on the affected side in the model group was significantly longer than that in the control group (P < 0.05) and the amplitude on affected side was significantly reduced (P < 0.01). After 3 days of electro-acupuncture, the latency on the affected side in the 2 Hz Shuigou group was significantly shortened (P < 0.05) and the amplitude was significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared with the model group. CONCLUSION: Low frequency electro-acupuncture at Shuigou (GV 26) can promote recovery of motor function after focal cerebral ischemic injury in rats.

22686079|t|[Analysis of thrombin-antithrombin complex expressions in the plasma and the hematoma fluid of intracerebral hemorrhage patients of excess syndrome of stroke and depletion syndrome of stroke].
22686079|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between the expressions of thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex and excess syndrome of stroke (ESS) and depletion syndrome of stroke (DSS) by dynamically observing the expressions of TAT complex in the plasma and hematoma fluid of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients. METHODS: Sixty patients were assigned to three groups according to syndrome typing, i.e., as yang excess group (18 cases), yin excess group (22 cases), and depletion syndrome group (20 cases). The hemorrhage volume was assessed. NIHSS and GCS were scored. Besides, 30 healthy volunteers at the Physical Examination Center, Second People's Hospital Affiliated to Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were recruited as the normal control group. Another 10 patients in need of lumbal anesthesia were recruited as the cerebrospinal fluid control group, who suffered from surgical, gynecologic pelvic diseases, or diseases from lower limbs, but unaccompanied with cardio-/cerebrovascular diseases. The expressions of TAT complex were detected in the venous blood and hematoma fluid of the patient groups and in the venous blood or the cerebrospinal fluid of the control group using ELISA. RESULTS: The syndromes were sequenced as the depletion syndrome > the yin excess syndrome > the yang excess syndrome according to the hemorrhage volume and NIHSS score. They were sequenced as the yang excess syndrome > the yin excess syndrome >the depletion syndrome according to the GCS score. The plasma TAT complex content on the 4th day in the ICH group was lower than that at the rest time points, showing statistical significance (P<0.01). Compared with the normal control group, the plasma TAT complex on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th day all increased with statistical difference (P<0.01). Statistical significance of the TAT complex in the hematoma fluid of the ICH group existed when compared it on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th day (P<0.01). Compared with the cerebrospinal fluid control group, the contents of the TAT complex in the hematoma fluid of the ICH group increased with statistical difference (P<0.01). The hemorrhage volume of ICH patients was positively correlated with NIHSS (r=0.809, P<0.01) and negatively correlated with GCS (r=-0.833, P<0.01). The TAT complex was obviously higher in the ICH group than in the two control groups in a dynamic way (P<0.01). There was obvious difference in the expressions of TAT among yang excess group, yin excess group, and depletion syndrome group (P<0.01). The expressions of TAT in the plasma and the hematoma fluid of the ICH group were negatively correlated with GCS score and positively correlated with NIHSS score (both P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: TAT complex participated in secondary neuron injury after ICH, which could be taken as an objective index for clinical observation. It also could provide evidence for syndrome quantification of excess syndrome and depletion syndrome.

22493908|t|[Double-center randomized controlled trial on post-stroke shoulder pain treated by electroacupuncture combined with Tuina].
22493908|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical therapeutic effect of post-stroke shoulder pain treated by acupuncture combined with Tuina. METHODS: Three hundred cases of post-stroke shoulder pain were randomly divided into an acupuncture and Tuina group and a rehabilitation group by double-center randomized controlled clinical trial method. In acupuncture and Tuina group, normalized electroacupuncture and Tuina therapy were applied, that was electroacupuncture at main points, such as Chize (LU 5), Quze (PC 3), Shaohai (HT 3), Jianyu (LI 15), Jianliao (TE 14) and Jianjing (GB 21),etc., combined with traditional Tuina manipulations; in rehabilitation group, the rehabilitation methods such as the electrostimulation through nervus cutaneus and the squeezing and stabilizing manipulations of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF), etc. were applied. The treatment courses of both groups were 6 weeks. The main therapeutic effect indices were the Assessment Face Scale (AFS) for pain when shoulder was in passive motion and the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment for upper limbs active function; the secondary indices were the moditied Rankin Scale (mRS) and the clinical incidences of shoulder-hand syndrome of hemiplegia and shoulder joint subluxation of hemiplegia. RESULTS: After 6 weeks treatment and 12 weeks follow-up, AFS score, Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of upper limbs active function and mRS evaluation in acupuncture and Tuina group were more obviously improved than those in rehabilitation group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Although the clinical incidences of shoulder-hand syndrome of hemiplegia and shoulder joint subluxation of hemiplegia in acupuncture and Tuina group was equal to those in rehabilitation group [3.55% (5/141) vs 8.45% (12/142), 1.42% (2/141) vs 5.63% (8/142), both P > 0.05], the data indicated that there was a superiority tendency in acupuncture and Tuina group. CONCLUSION: The combined therapy of electroacupuncture and Tuina is a normative manipulation, and the therapeutic effect is satisfying for post-stroke shoulder pain, superior to that of comprehensive rehabilitation treatment.

22574583|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of qi-supplementing dominated Chinese materia medica (QSDCMM) combined with rehabilitation training on the quality of life (QOL) of ischemic post-stroke fatigue (PSF) patients of qi deficiency syndrome. METHODS: Ninety ischemic stroke patients of qi deficiency were randomly assigned to 3 groups, 30 in each. Patients in the Chinese medicine treatment group were treated with oral administration of QSDCMM decoction and rehabilitation. Those in the Western medicine treatment group were treated with Chinese medicine placebo, Western medicine, and rehabilitation. Those in the control group were treated with Chinese medicine placebo and rehabilitation. The therapeutic course for all was 4 weeks. All patients were assessed using Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) before treatment and 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment the scores of SS-QOL and FSS increased in the 3 groups, especially in the CM treatment group, showing significant difference (P < 0.05). After treatment significant difference existed between the CM treatment group and the Western medicine treatment group, between the CM treatment group and the control group, showing significant difference (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the Western medicine treatment group and the control group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: QSDCMM combined with rehabilitation training could improve the QOL of ischemic PSF patients of qi deficiency syndrome.

22265479|t|NMR analysis of the rat neurochemical changes induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion.
22265479|a|Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, affecting millions of people worldwide with almost 80% of them as ischemic stroke and understanding the multiple mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia is essential for development of effective treatments. To understand metabolic changes induced by focal brain ischemia, we conducted a comparative analysis of metabolic composition of cerebral tissue from rats with sham-operation and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. More than 40 metabolites were assigned including organic acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, choline, pyrimidine and purine metabolites. Our results showed that MCAO led to significant level decreases for glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), taurine, malate, fumarate, acetate, phosphocreatine, and purine and pyrimidine metabolites such as inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, uracil and UDP/UTP, together with significant level increases for glucose in focal brain tissue extracts. This demonstrated that experimental ischemic stroke in rats caused extensive perturbation in tricarboxylic acid cycle, GABA shunt, and metabolisms of choline and nucleic acids. These findings provided essential information for our understandings of MCAO-caused biochemical alterations and demonstrated the metabolite composition analysis as a useful tool for understanding the neurochemistry of stroke.

23156202|t|Acute effects of electro-acupuncture (EA) on hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) of perforant path-dentate gyrus granule cells synapse related to memory.
23156202|a|Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese therapeutic method, has been widely used in clinical practice to treat diseases such as stroke, Bell's palsy, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson diseases, dysmenorrhea and chronic pain. Mounting lab data had suggested that electro-acupuncture could alleviate dementia and restore long term potentiation of hippocampus in rat. Clinical data also indicated that electro-acupuncture could improve electrical activity of brain in vascular dementia patients. However, its biological basis and acute effects on hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) remain not well understood. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether acute electro-acupuncture (acupoints: ST36 and SP6; continuous wave, 2 mV, 2Hz; lasted 20 min) could enhance LTP of perforant path-dentate gyrus granule cells in anesthetized rat and explore its underlying mechanisms. We found that electro-acupuncture could significantly increase PS2/PS 1 in pair pulse test (P <0.05, inter-pulse interval: 20ms and 90ms). When compared to control group, electro-acupuncture could significantly enhance LTP to about 234% which was about 143% of that in control group (P <0.05). It suggested that electro-acupuncture could modulate the function of interneurons in hippocampus hence increase LTP.

22972486|t|Arctigenin protects focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats through inhibiting neuroinflammation.
22972486|a|Stroke is the third leading cause of death in industrialized countries and the most important cause of acquired adult disability. Many evidences suggest that inflammation accounts for the progression of cerebral ischemic injury. Arctigenin, a phenylpropanoid dibenzylbutyrolactone lignin isolated from certain plants, has shown anti-inflammatory activity against diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we tested whether arctigenin can protect middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAO) rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with arctigenin or vehicle for 7 d before being subjected to transient occlusion of middle cerebral artery and reperfusion. Rats were evaluated at 24 h after MCAO for neurological deficit scoring. Furthermore, the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of arctigenin was investigated with a focus on inflammatory cells, proinflammatory cytokines, and transcriptional factors. Arctigenin significantly reduced cerebral infarction and improved neurological outcome. Arctigenin suppressed the activation of microglia and decreased the expression of interleukin (IL)- 1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. These results revealed that arctigenin has a promising therapeutic effect in ischemic stroke treatment through an anti-inflammatory mechanism.

22878260|t|Osthole attenuates focal inflammatory reaction following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.
22878260|a|Osthole, a main active constituent from Cnidium monnieri (L.) CUSSON, has been considered therapeutic agent in the treatment of ischemic stroke. This study was designed to investigate the effect of osthole on permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Osthole was administrated by gavage to the normal and the MCAO rats. Rats were assessed for neurological deficit after 24 h following MCAO, then their brains were evaluated to determine the infarct area, and the mRNA and protein levels of some inflammatory factors were detected. It was found that MCAO animals pre-treated with osthole for 7 d showed significant improvement in all neurological tests compared with vehicle-treated MCAO groups. In addition, there was a significant decrease in infarct volume 24 h after occlusion in animals pre-treated with osthole versus the vehicle-treated MCAO group. MCAO also dramatically caused some inflammatory factors increase. However, pretreatment with osthole restored the mRNA and protein levels of these factors, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) of ischemic penumbra cortices, suggesting that osthole possessed the function of preventing brain against ischemic damage, while no significant difference was found in any of normal groups with or without osthole. The present study demonstrated that osthole may be a novel neuroprotective therapy in the treatment of focal ischemic stroke.

23304199|t|An investigation of the use of traditional chinese medicine in stroke patients in taiwan.
23304199|a|Background. The use of complementary and alternative medicine in critical illness is increasing worldwide. This study investigates how traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is used in stroke patients. Methods. Using Taiwan National Health Insurance reimbursement claims, we compared the annual use of TCM between stroke patients and general population, identifying 15,330 patients with a new onset of stroke in 2000-2009. The sociodemographic status and medical comorbidities between stroke patients receiving TCM services and those without using the service were compared. Results. The use of TCM was higher in stroke patients than in the general population, 27.9% versus 25.4% in 2000 and 32.7% versus 27.8% in 2009, respectively, and grew consistently from 2000 to 2009. Among stroke patients, women, younger patients, white-collar employees, higher-income residents, and those living in areas with more TCM physicians were more likely to use TCM. Stroke patients using rehabilitation services were more likely to have more TCM visits (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.96-2.66) and higher expenditure on TCM (OR = 2.67, 95% CI = 2.29-3.12) compared with stroke patients without rehabilitation. Conclusion. TCM is popular and well accepted in Taiwan. Patients with stroke have a higher TCM utilization rate than people without stroke.

23118787|t|Systems biology of meridians, acupoints, and chinese herbs in disease.
23118787|a|Meridians, acupoints, and Chinese herbs are important components of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). They have been used for disease treatment and prevention and as alternative and complementary therapies. Systems biology integrates omics data, such as transcriptional, proteomic, and metabolomics data, in order to obtain a more global and complete picture of biological activity. To further understand the existence and functions of the three components above, we reviewed relevant research in the systems biology literature and found many recent studies that indicate the value of acupuncture and Chinese herbs. Acupuncture is useful in pain moderation and relieves various symptoms arising from acute spinal cord injury and acute ischemic stroke. Moreover, Chinese herbal extracts have been linked to wound repair, the alleviation of postmenopausal osteoporosis severity, and anti-tumor effects, among others. Different acupoints, variations in treatment duration, and herbal extracts can be used to alleviate various symptoms and conditions and to regulate biological pathways by altering gene and protein expression. Our paper demonstrates how systems biology has helped to establish a platform for investigating the efficacy of TCM in treating different diseases and improving treatment strategies.

22675376|t|Chinese medicine injection qingkailing for treatment of acute ischemia stroke: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
22675376|a|Qingkailing (QKL) injection was a famous traditional Chinese patent medicine, which was extensively used to treat the acute stages of cerebrovascular disease. The aim of this study was to assess the quantity, quality and overall strength of the evidence on QKL in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Methods. An extensive search was performed within MEDLINE, Cochrane, CNKI, Vip and Wan-Fang up to November 2011. Randomized controlled trails (RCTs) on QKL for treatment of acute stroke were collected, irrespective of languages. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards, and RevMan5 was used for data analysis. Results. 7 RCTs (545 patients) were included and the methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. The pooled results showed that QKL combined with conventional treatment was more effective in effect rate, and the score of MESSS and TNF-α level compared with conventional treatment alone, but there was no significant difference in mortality of two groups. Only one trial reported routine life status. There were four trials reported adverse events, and no obvious adverse event occurred in three trials while one reported adverse events described as eruption and dizziness.

22201915|t|Traditional Chinese herbal medicine and cerebral ischemia.
22201915|a|Stroke is an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide but effective therapeutic strategy for the prevention of brain injury in patients with cerebral ischemia is lacking. Although tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) has been used to treat stroke patients, this therapeutic strategy is confronted with ill side effects and is limited to patients within 3 hours of a stroke. Stroke-mediated cell death is a complex interplay of aberrant events involving excitotoxicity, acidosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, peri-infarct depolarization, and apoptosis. Due to the complexity of the events and the disappointing results from single agent trials, the combination of thrombolytic therapy and effective neural protection therapy may be an alternative strategy for patients with cerebral ischemia. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been described in ancient medicine systems as a treatment for various ailments associated with stroke. Recently, there have been reports of its benefits in treating stroke. This review will focus on various traditional Chinese herbal medicines and their neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia.

22915851|t|Core-shell hybrid liposomal vesicles loaded with panax notoginsenoside: preparation, characterization and protective effects on global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and acute myocardial ischemia in rats.
22915851|a|PURPOSE: Novel panax notoginsenoside-loaded core-shell hybrid liposomal vesicles (PNS-HLV) were developed to resolve the restricted bioavailability of PNS and to enhance its protective effects in vivo on oral administration. METHODS: Physicochemical characterizations of PNS-HLV included assessment of morphology, particle size and zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE%), stability and in vitro release study. In addition, to evaluate its oral treatment potential, we compared the effect of PNS-HLV on global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and acute myocardial ischemia injury with those of PNS solution, conventional PNS-loaded nanoparticles, and liposomes. RESULTS: In comparison with PNS solution, conventional PNS-loaded nanoparticles and liposomes, PNS-HLV was stable for at least 12 months at 4°C. Satisfactory improvements in the EE% of notoginsenoside R1, ginsenoside Rb1, and ginsenoside Rg1 were shown with the differences in EE% shortened and the greater controlled drug release profiles were exhibited from PNS-HLV. The improvements in the physicochemical properties of HLV contributed to the results that PNS-HLV was able to significantly inhibit the edema of brain and reduce the infarct volume, while it could markedly inhibit H(2)O(2), modified Dixon agar, and serum lactate dehydrogenase, and increase superoxide dismutase (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study imply that HLV has promising prospects for improving free drug bioactivity on oral administration.

22472211|t|Morusinol extracted from Morus alba inhibits arterial thrombosis and modulates platelet activation for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
22472211|a|Morus alba (white mulberry) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine as an anti-headache, diuretic, expectorant, and anti-diabetic agent. In previous studies, extracts of Morus alba demonstrated favorable biological properties, such as antioxidant activity, suppression of lipoxygenase (LOX)-1, cytotoxicity against cancer cells, and inhibition of the invasion and migration of cancer cells.AIM: This study further evaluated the effects of morusinol, a flavonoid derived from Morus alba root bark, on platelet aggregation and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2) formation in vitro and thrombus formation in vivo. METHODS: The antiplatelet potential of morusinol was measured using in vitro rabbit platelet aggregation and TXB(2) formation assays. Arterial thrombus formation was investigated using an in vivo ferric chloride (FeCl(3)-induced thrombosis model. RESULTS: Morusinol significantly inhibited collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and TXB(2) formation in cultured platelets in a concentration-dependent manner. Thrombus formation was reduced by 32.1, 42.0, and 99.0% for collagen-induced TXB(2) formation, and 8.0, 24.1, and 29.2% for arachadonic acid-induced TXB(2) formation, with 5, 10, and 30 µg/mL morusinol, respectively. Moreover, oral morusinol (20 mg/kg) or aspirin (20 mg/kg) for three days significantly increased the time to occlusion in vivo by 20.3±5.0 or 6.8±2.9 min, respectively, compared with the control (1% CMC, carboxymethyl cellulose). CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results indicate that morusinol may significantly inhibit arterial thrombosis in vivo due to antiplatelet activity. Thus, morusinol may exert beneficial effects on transient ischemic attacks or stroke via the modulation of platelet activation.

22731403|t|Three-in-one agonists for PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, and PPAR-δ from traditional Chinese medicine.
22731403|a|Nowadays, the occurrence of metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by obesity and clinical disorders, has been increasing rapidly over the world. It induces several serious chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, gall bladder disease, hypertension, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, stroke, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which have three isoforms: PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, and PPAR-δ, are key regulators of adipogenesis, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and are potential drug targets for treating metabolic syndrome. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds from TCM Database@Taiwan ( http://tcm.cmu.edu.tw/ ) were employed to virtually screen for potential PPAR agonists, and structure-based pharmacophore models were generated to identify the key interactions for each PPAR protein. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to evaluate the stability of the PPAR-ligand complexes in a dynamic state. (S)-Tryptophan-betaxanthin and berberrubine, which have higher Dock Score than controls, form stable interactions during MD, and are further supported by the structure-based pharmacophore models in each PPAR protein. Key features include stable H-bonds with Thr279 and Ala333 of PPAR-α, with Thr252, Thr253 and Lys331 of PPAR-δ, and with Arg316 and Glu371 of PPAR-γ. Hence, we propose the top two TCM candidates as potential lead compounds in developing agonists targeting PPARs protein for treating metabolic syndrome.

23166749|t|Paeoniflorin protects against ischemia-induced brain damages in rats via inhibiting MAPKs/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses.
23166749|a|Paeoniflorin (PF), the principal component of Paeoniae Radix prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to exhibit many pharmacological effects including protection against ischemic injury. However, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of PF on cerebral ischemia are still under investigation. The present study showed that PF treatment for 14 days could significantly inhibit transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced over-activation of astrocytes and microglia, and prevented up-regulations of pro-inflamamtory mediators (TNFα, IL-1β, iNOS, COX(2) and 5-LOX) in plasma and brain. Further study demonstrated that chronic treatment with PF suppressed the activations of JNK and p38 MAPK, but enhanced ERK activation. And PF could reverse ischemia-induced activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, our in vitro study revealed that PF treatment protected against TNFα-induced cell apoptosis and neuronal loss. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that PF produces a delayed protection in the ischemia-injured rats via inhibiting MAPKs/NF-κB mediated peripheral and cerebral inflammatory response. Our study reveals that PF might be a potential neuroprotective agent for stroke.

23049867|t|Synergism and rules from combination of Baicalin, Jasminoidin and Desoxycholic acid in refined Qing Kai Ling for treat ischemic stroke mice model.
23049867|a|Refined Qing-Kai-Ling (QKL), a modified Chinese medicine, consists of three main ingredients (Baicalin, Jasminoidin and Desoxycholic acid), plays a synergistic effect on the treatment of the acute stage of ischemic stroke. However, the rules of the combination and synergism are still unknown. Based on the ischemic stroke mice model, all different kinds of combination of Baicalin, Jasminoidin, and Desoxycholic acid were investigated by the methods of neurological examination, microarray, and genomics analysis. As a result, it confirmed that the combination of three drugs offered a better therapeutical effect on ischemic stroke than monotherapy of each drug. Additionally, we used Ingenuity pathway Analysis (IPA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the dominant information of expression changes in 373 ischemia-related genes. The results suggested that 5 principal components (PC1-5) could account for more than 95% energy in the gene data. Moreover, 3 clusters (PC1, PC2+PC5, and PC3+PC4) were addressed with cluster analysis. Furthermore, we matched PCs on the drug-target networks, the findings demonstrated that Baicalin related with PC1 that played the leading role in the combination; Jasminoidin related with PC2+PC5 that played a compensatory role; while Desoxycholic acid had the least performance alone which could relate with PC3+PC4 that played a compatible role. These manifestations were accorded with the principle of herbal formulae of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), emperor-minister-adjuvant-courier. In conclusion, we firstly provided scientific evidence to the classic theory of TCM formulae, an initiating holistic viewpoint of combination therapy of TCM. This study also illustrated that PCA might be an applicable method to analyze the complicated data of drug combination.

22952787|t|HPLC-MS/MS analysis of a traditional Chinese medical formulation of Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu-Tang and its pharmacokinetics after oral administration to rats.
22952787|a|Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang (BYHWT) is one of the most popular formulated traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, and is widely for prevention of ischemic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases and stroke-induced disability. A specific high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) has been developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of the nine main bioactive components, i.e., astragaloside I, astragaloside II, astragaloside IV, formononetin, ononin, calycosin, calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside, ligustilide and paeoniflorin in rat plasma after oral administration of BYHWT extract. This method was applied to investigate the pharmacokinetics in conscious and freely moving rats. No significant matrix effects were observed. The overall analytical procedure was rapid and reproducible, which makes it suitable for quantitative analysis of a large number of samples. Among them, three astragalosides and four isoflavones in A. membranaceus, ligustilide in Radix Angelicae Sinensis and Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong and paeoniflorin in Radix Paeoniae Rubra were identified. This developed method was then successfully applied to pharmacokinetic studies of the nine bioactive constituents after oral administration of BYHWT extracts in rats. The pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that astragaloside I, astragaloside II, astragaloside IV and ligustilide presented the phenomenon of double peaks. The other herbal ingredients of formononetin, ononin, calycosin, calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside and paeoniflorin appeared together in a single and plateau absorption phase. These phenomenona suggest that these components may have multiple absorption sites, regulation of enterohepatic circulation or the gastric emptying rate, or there is ingredient-ingredient interaction. These pharmacokinetic results provide a constructive contribution to better understand the absorption mechanism of BYHWT and to support additional clinical evaluation.

22545124|t|Direct stimulation of adult neural stem/progenitor cells in vitro and neurogenesis in vivo by salvianolic acid B.
22545124|a|BACKGROUND: Small molecules have been shown to modulate the neurogenesis processes. In search for new therapeutic drugs, the herbs used in traditional medicines for neurogenesis are promising candidates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We selected a total of 45 natural compounds from Traditional Chinese herbal medicines which are extensively used in China to treat stroke clinically, and tested their proliferation-inducing activities on neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). The screening results showed that salvianolic acid B (Sal B) displayed marked effects on the induction of proliferation of NSPCs. We further demonstrated that Sal B promoted NSPCs proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manners. To explore the molecular mechanism, PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK and Notch signaling pathways were investigated. Cell proliferation assay demonstrated that Ly294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor), but neither U0126 (ERK inhibitor) nor DAPT (Notch inhibitor) inhibited the Sal B-induced proliferation of cells. Western Blotting results showed that stimulation of NSPCs with Sal B enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt, and Ly294002 abolished this effect, confirming the role of Akt in Sal B mediated proliferation of NSPCs. Rats exposed to transient cerebral ischemia were treated for 4 weeks with Sal B from the 7th day after stroke. BrdU incorporation assay results showed that exposure Sal B could maintain the proliferation of NSPCs after cerebral ischemia. Morris water maze test showed that delayed post-ischemic treatment with Sal B improved cognitive impairment after stroke in rats. SIGNIFICANCE: Sal B could maintain the NSPCs self-renew and promote proliferation, which was mediated by PI3K/Akt signal pathway. And delayed post-ischemic treatment with Sal B improved cognitive impairment after stroke in rats. These findings suggested that Sal B may act as a potential drug in treatment of brain injury or neurodegenerative diseases.

22500406|t|[Analyzing the Chinese medicine pathogenesis of stroke].
22500406|a|Both ischemic and hemorrhage stroke pertain to the category of wind stroke in Chinese medicine (CM). Up to date, it is deemed that the etiology and pathogenesis of wind stroke are wind, fire, sputum, qi, stasis, and deficiency. Among them, it is regarded that wind and fire are the key factors triggering wind stroke. By analyzing the time order and causality, it is found that wind stroke is prior to the onset of wind and fire, wind and fire are the secondary outcomes of wind stroke. By parallel comparing stroke with thromboembolism and hemorrhagic diseases in other Zang-organs, it can be comprehended that the reason why wind symptoms appear in stroke is due to its physiological feature of brain itself. Based on Neijing, the pathogenesis of wind stroke is proposed as follows. Tunnels of viscera (vessels) get lesions. The old pathogenic factors of sputum and stasis or the stasis formed by bleeding inside viscera consume qi, and blood of viscera and damage the spirits hidden in them. The damage of Gan-spirit causes symptoms of stroke, such as hemiplegia, deviation of eyes and mouth, and so on. Wind and fire symptoms are caused by the injury of Gan blood and yin, and/or the stagnation of fire in pericardium (the pathway organ) due to obstruction by old pathogenic factors and stasis (formed by bleeding).

22229507|t|Neuroprotective effects of scutellarin against hypoxic-ischemic-induced cerebral injury via augmentation of antioxidant defense capacity.
22229507|a|An increasing number of studies has indicated that hypoxic-ischemic-induced cerebral injury is partly mediated via oxidative stress. Recent researches have focused on searching for drug and herbal manipulations to protect against hypoxic-ischemic-induced oxidative cell damage. Scutellarin is a flavonoid derived from the Erigeron breviscapus (vant.) and has been reported to exhibit neuroprotective properties. However, its precise mechanism, particularly its antioxidation mechanism, remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of scutellarin on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced brain damage in rats, and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced toxicity in primary culture of rat cortical neurons. In vivo, intraperitoneal injections of scutellarin (20 and 60 mg/kg) improved the neurological score and diminished the percentage of brain infarct volume. At the same time, scutellarin significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities and glutathione (GSH) level in ischemic brain tissues, enhancing endogenous antioxidant activity. Moreover, pretreatment of scutellarin (25, 50 and 100 μM) protected neurons against lethal stimuli, decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells and inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in OGD-induced primary cortical neurons in vitro. These results suggest that the preventive and therapeutic potential of scutellarin in cerebral injury patients is, at least in part, ascribed to augmentation of cellular antioxidant defense capacity.

22111799|t|Alternative therapies for stroke treatment in Asia.
22111799|a|Patients seek alternative therapies for stroke in Asia due to dissatisfaction with poststroke recovery. Most alternative therapies are of unproven benefit in rehabilitation. Well-conducted trials are needed to better define the role of alternative therapies in the process of poststroke recovery; the CHInese Medicine Neuroaid Efficacy on Stroke recovery is ongoing. However, further studies, better health education and rehabilitation services and centers are also required.

21836043|t|Electroacupuncture increased cerebral blood flow and reduced ischemic brain injury: dependence on stimulation intensity and frequency.
21836043|a|Stroke causes ischemic brain injury and is a leading cause of neurological disability and death. There is, however, no promising therapy to protect the brain from ischemic stress to date. Here we show an exciting finding that optimal electroacupuncture (EA) effectively protects the brain from ischemic injury. The experiments were performed on rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow. EA was delivered to acupoints of "Shuigou" (Du 26) and "Baihui" (Du 20) with different intensities and frequencies to optimize the stimulation parameters. The results showed that 1) EA at 1.0-1.2 mA and 5-20 Hz remarkably reduced ischemic infarction, neurological deficit, and death rate; 2) the EA treatment increased the blood flow by >100%, which appeared immediately after the initiation of EA and disappeared after the cessation of EA; 3) the EA treatment promoted the recovery of the blood flow after MCAO; 4) "nonoptimal" parameters of EA (e.g., <0.6 mA or >40 Hz) could not improve the blood flow or reduce ischemic injury; and 5) the same EA treatment with optimal parameters could not increase the blood flow in naive brains. These novel observations suggest that appropriate EA treatment protects the brain from cerebral ischemia by increasing blood flow to the ischemic brain region via a rapid regulation. Our findings have far-reaching impacts on the prevention and treatment of ischemic encephalopathy, and the optimized EA parameters may potentially be a useful clue for the clinical application of EA.

22152766|t|[Studies on dynamic changes in traditional Chinese medicine syndrome patterns for stroke using data-driven and model-driven approaches: a review].
22152766|a|Many clinical studies showed that the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes in stroke have been dynamically changing since the onset of the disease. The changing of TCM syndromes can be attributed to multiple correlative factors such as age, sex, area distribution, underlying diseases, and constitutional factor. Data-driven methods involving multivariate statistical methods and descriptive approach have been used to analyze the regularity of dynamically changed TCM syndromes of stroke. However, expressing non-linear relationship between symptom or correlative factors and syndrome patterns by data-driven models is challenging. Model-driven methods involving artificial neural networks and Bayesian networks are new methods for studying the changes in TCM syndromes in patients with stroke. In this review, the authors summarized the studies of dynamically changed patterns of stroke syndromes based on data-driven methods and some clinical trials on TCM syndromes based on model-driven methods. Further studies are needed to improve the understanding of the dynamically changing regularity of TCM syndromes for stroke by using model-driven methods so as to develop appropriate and timely TCM treatments.

22256635|t|[Efficacy observation of Thoroughfare Vessel theory in acupuncture for post-stroke dysphasia].
22256635|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in the efficacy on post-stoke dysphagia between the point selection according to Thoroughfare Vessel theory and conventional point selection in treatment. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients were randomly divided into an observation group (n = 42) and a control group (n = 36). In observation group, acupuncture was applied to the acupoints selected according to Thoroughfare Vessel theory such as Dazhu (BL 11), Shangjuxu (ST 37), Xiajuxu (ST 39), Neiguan (PC 6) and Gongsun (SP 4) Mainly. In control group, acupuncture was applied to the conventional acupoints such as Fengchi (GB 20), Lianquan (CV 23), Tiantu (CV 22), Neiguan (PC 6) and Zusanli (ST 36), etc. Acupuncture was given once per day in either group, 12 treatments made one session and 4 sessions of treatment were required. The water swallow test was adopted to assess the swallowing function in two groups. RESULTS: The effective rate was 100.0% (42/42) in observation group and was 77.8% (28/36) in control group. The efficacy in observation group was superior to control group (P < 0.05). The curative time was (28.65 +/- 10.42) days in observation group and was (38.74 +/- 21.30) days in control group. The time was shorter apparently in observation group as compared with control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The Thoroughfare Vessel theory in acupuncture treatment for post-stroke dysphasia achieves a superior efficacy as compared with the conventional acupoint selection, and this theory may quickly determine the point prescription in treatment.

22384548|t|[Study on the correlation between stroke of qi deficiency syndrome and the neurological impairment degree and its long-term prognosis].
22384548|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between stroke of qi deficiency syndrome (QDS) and the neurological impairment degree, and to study its correlation between QDS and its long-term prognosis. METHODS: Recruited were 706 stroke patients with complete clinical information including diagnostic scale scoring of elements such as wind, fire, phlegm, blood stasis, qi deficiency, and yin deficiency, scoring of The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) within 72 h from attack, on the 7th, 14th, 28th, and 90th day after attack, and Barthel index (BI) scoring on the 90th day. They were assigned to the QDS group (330 cases) and the non-QDS group (376 cases). The NIHSS scores at different time points were compared between the two groups using analysis of variance of repeated measure data. The correlation between each syndrome element and the long-term prognosis of stroke was studied using Logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Higher NIHSS score was found in patients of QDS than those of non-QDS at each time point (P < 0.01). Statistical difference existed in NIHSS score between the two groups at each time point (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Besides, NIHSS score decreased gradually as time went by. The occurrence frequencies of blood stasis syndrome and phlegm syndrome were higher at each time point. On the 90th day after attack, 427 patients with BI > or = 95 (accounting for 60%) had favorable prognosis, while 279 with BI < 95 (accounting for 40%) had unfavorable prognosis. QDS at each time point was negatively correlated with the 90th-day BI, with the B value being -0.496, -0.714, -0.867, -0.567, and -0.764, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke patients of QDS had more severe neurological impairment than those of non-QDS. Stroke patients of acute-stage QDS was closely correlated with unfavorable prognosis on the 90th day after attack. Early actively invigorating healthy qi plays an important role in improving the long-term prognosis of stroke patients.

21963893|t|Polymorphisms of genes in nitric oxide-forming pathway associated with ischemic stroke in Chinese Han population.
21963893|a|AIM: To investigate the association of polymorphisms in four critical genes implicated in the NO-forming pathway with ischemic stroke (IS) in a Chinese Han population. METHODS: DNA samples of 558 IS patients and 557 healthy controls from Chinese Han population were genotyped using the Taqman(TM) 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Six SNPs (rs841, rs1049255, rs2297518, rs1799983, rs2020744, rs4673) of the 4 related genes (eNOS, iNOS, GCH1, and CYBA) in the NO forming pathway were analyzed using the SPSS 13.0 software package for Windows. RESULTS: One SNP located in the intron of GCH1 (rs841) was associated with IS independent of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors in co-dominant and dominant models (P=0.003, q=0.027; P=0.00006, q=0.0108; respectively). Moreover, the combination of rs1049255 CC+CT and rs841 GA+AA genotypes was associated with significantly higher risk for IS after adjustments (OR=1.73, 95% CI: 1.27-2.35, P<0.0001, q<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The data suggest that genetic variants within the NO-forming pathway alter susceptibility to IS in Chinese Han population. Replication of the present results in other independent cohorts is warranted.

22057410|t|Chinese medicine pattern differentiation and its implications for clinical practice.
22057410|a|Chinese medicine practitioners apply the differentiation reasoning for decision-making. The wide scope of Chinese medicine intervention provides coverage of methods and techniques with applications to primary, secondary and tertiary levels of prevention. The rapid evolution of mathematical and computational techniques allowed the implementation of several models for pattern differentiation that were tested for several physiologic systems. Concurrently, it is argued that pattern differentiation might improve the efficacy of either traditional or conventional medical interventions. This article reviewed the influence of pattern differentiation into clinical practice organized by medical field: general pattern differentiation; genitourinary (recurrent cystitis); cardiovascular (coronary heart disease; arterial hypertension; angina pectoris); neurology (stroke); surgery; metabolic (diabetes mellitus); hepatic (cirrhosis); gastrointestinal (chronic superficial gastritis); orthopedic (low back pain; rheumatoid arthritis; cervical spondylosis; elbow arthritis); oncology (gastric mucosal dysplasia; lung cancer); gynecologic and obstetric manifestations (nausea and vomiting). The reviewed studies presented achievements that have contributed to the integration of Chinese medicine and evidence-based medicine in the treatment of many mild and severe diseases. Target diseases considered as major public health problems were also investigated and the results are promising regarding the possibility to treat guided by pattern differentiation.

22303709|t|[Retrospective analysis of risk factors in 900 patients with ischemic cerebral stroke of wind-phlegm collateral obstruction syndrome and qi deficiency blood stasis syndrome in Wuhan District].
22303709|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlation between risk factors and ischemic cerebral stroke of wind-phlegm collateral obstruction syndrome and qi deficiency blood stasis syndrome. METHODS: Totally 900 patients of the two syndrome types were recruited. Risk factors correlated to ischemic cerebral stroke such as gender, age, time of onset, site of infarction, tongue proper, tongue fur, pulse picture, hypertension, diabetes, past stroke history, hyperlipidemia, hematocrit, smoking, drinking, genetic factor, blood type, complications were analyzed using Chi-square test and non-conditional Logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Statistical significance existed between the two syndrome types in age (X2 = 8.2392, P = 0.0413), hyperlipidemia (X2 = 4.8386, P = 0.0278), tongue proper (X2 = 7.9470, P = 0.0048), and tongue fur (X2 = 4.3298, P = 0.0375). Statistical significance existed between the two syndrome types in hyperlipidemia, tongue proper, and tongue fur, and their OR value was 0.699 (P = 0.0282), 0.332 (P =0.0071), and 0.667 (P = 0.0382) respectively. The OR value of the past stroke history was 3.226 (P = 0.0314), that of complications 0.203 (P = 0.0705), and that of anterior circulation infarction 0.214 (P = 0.0098). CONCLUSIONS: Among different ages groups, the constituent ratio of qi deficiency blood stasis syndrome was obviously higher than that of wind-phlegm collateral obstruction syndrome. Besides, patients of qi deficiency blood stasis syndrome were liable to suffer from hyperlipidemia, anterior circulation infarction, and complications. The age, blood lipid levels, site of infarction, complications are closely correlated with Chinese syndrome types of ischemic cerebral stroke, which can provide objective indices for typing ischemic cerebral stroke.

22303707|a|OBJECTIVE: To study effects of unblocking meridians and Du-channel massage combined with rehabilitation training on the motor function improvement of cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS) patients. METHODS: Eighty CIS patients were assigned to the treatment group (40 cases) and the control group (40 cases) using random digit table method. Bobath technique was mainly carried out in patients in the control group. On the basis of routine rehabilitation training, unblocking meridians and Du-channel massage was additionally given to patients in the treatment group. The therapeutic course for all patients was 8 weeks. The changes of Fugl-Meyer Assessment-L (FMA-L), 10 meter maximal walking speed (MWS), and gait space and time parameters were compared before and after treatment. RESULTS: Before treatment there was no significant difference in each index between the two groups (P > 0.05). After treatment there was significant difference in these indices between the two groups (P < 0.05), with better results obtained in the treatment group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The unblocking meridians and Du-channel massage could improve the motor function and walking capability of CIS patients, which was worthy of further summaries.

21784143|t|Deciphering the neuroprotective mechanisms of Bu-yang Huan-wu decoction by an integrative neurofunctional and genomic approach in ischemic stroke mice.
21784143|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bu-yang Huan-wu decoction (BHD) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine formula that has been used clinically in Asia to treat stroke-induced disability for centuries, but the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms are not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we aim to investigate the mechanisms of action using an integrative neurofunctional and broad genomics approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male ICR mice were subjected to an acute ischemic stroke by inducing a middle cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (CI/R) injury. To examine whether BHD could extend the lifespan of mice with a stroke, we used oral administration of BHD (0.5 and 1.0g/kg) twice daily starting from 2h after ischemia and compared this with vehicle control treatments, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA, 10mg/kg, i.v.), and MK-801 (0.2mg/kg, i.p.). An integrative neurofunctional and genomic approach was performed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of BHD. RESULTS: More than 80% of the mice died within 2 days after stroke induction in the vehicle control treatment group. However, the survival rates and life-spans of mice treated with BHD, rt-PA and MK-801 were significantly enhanced as compared to the vehicle-treated CI/R group in all three cases. Mice treated with BHD (1.0g/kg) showed the greatest protective effect across all groups. BHD successfully restored brain function, ameliorated the cerebral infarction, and significantly improved the neurological deficits of the mice with a stroke. BHD also reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, as well as improved neurogenesis. The molecular impacts of BHD were assessed by genome-wide transcriptome analysis using brains from the CI/R mice. The results showed a total of 377 ischemia-induced probe-sets that were significantly influenced by BHD including 93 probe-sets that were commonly more abundant in BHD-treated and sham mice, and another 284 ischemia-induced probe sets that were suppressed by BHD. Mining the functional modules and genetic networks of these 377 genes revealed a significant upregulation of neuroprotective genes associated with neurogenesis (6 genes) and nervous system development (9 genes), and a significant down-regulation of destructive genes associated with the induction of inflammation (14 genes), apoptosis (15 genes), angiogenesis (11 genes) and blood coagulation (7 genes) by BHD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that BHD is able to protect mice against stroke and extend lifespan primarily through a significant down-regulation of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and blood coagulation, as well as an up-regulation of genes mediating neurogenesis and nervous system development. The changes in expression after treatment with BHD are beneficial after ischemic stroke.

21922279|t|The role of VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling in peripheral stimulation-induced cerebral neurovascular regeneration after ischemic stroke in mice.
21922279|a|Ischemic stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide but effective treatments are limited. Strategies to enhance neurovascular remodeling following stroke provide promising opportunities to improve tissue repair and functional recovery. We have previously demonstrated that whisker activity promotes central angiogenesis in rodent models of whisker-barrel cortex stroke. However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of neurovascular plasticity by peripheral stimulation are not well-defined. Here, we report that angiogenesis and neurogenesis occur concurrently after cerebral ischemia and whisker stimulation in mice. We show that neuroblasts expressing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) migrate along the vessels. Blocking VEGFR2 with the selective inhibitor SU5416 (semaxinib) attenuates ischemia-induced regenerative responses and completely prevents whisker stimulation-induced neurovascular remodeling. These results suggest that VEGFR2-mediated signaling plays an important role in promoting post-ischemia neurovascular remodeling and provides a link between angiogenesis and neurogenesis.

22292367|t|[Post-marketing re-evaluation of Kudiezi injection study on early treatment in patients with ischemic stroke].
22292367|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect and safety of Kudiezi injection on patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHOD: Seven hundreds patients were divided into two groups by central randomization system. The study group, 346 cases, was treated with kudiezi injection plus traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) synthesis rehabilitation project, and the control group, 354 cases, was treated with synthetic rehabilitation project. The patients were treated for 10 to 21 days. Before treatment and at the 7th, 14th and 21th day of treatment, the indexes include NIHSS used for evaluating the neurological deficit degree and the motor function score (Fugl-Meyer) for evaluating motor function were observed. The safety index is defined by adverse observation event and laboratory test. The incidence of adverse events and laboratory tests results were observed before and after treatment at the same time. RESULT: Application of generalized estimating equation model, we found that as the treatment time, NIHSS score and FMI score of the two groups showed a trend of improvement. And at the 14th days and 21th days of treatment, compared to the control group the treatment group showed significant statistical difference on the impact of NIHSS and FMI (P<0.05). No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: Kudiezi injection plus TCM rehabilitation project of ischemic stroke showed some superiority to western medicine rehabilitation program on improving the neurological deficit and motor function. Kudiezi injection is safe and effective in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

21798326|t|Effect of Tong Luo Jiu Nao on Aβ-degrading enzymes in AD rat brains.
21798326|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tong Luo Jiu Nao (TLJN) is a modern Chinese formula based on Traditional Chinese Medicine theory that has been used to treat ischemic cerebral stroke and vascular dementia. TLJN belongs to the ethnopharmacological family of medicines. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the TLJN effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD). AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effect of TLJN on β-amyloid-degrading enzymes and learning and memory in the AD rat brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AD rats whose disease was induced by Aβ(25-35) injection into the bilateral hippocampus CA1 region were subjected to intragastric administration of various preparations. The experimental animals were healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats which were randomly divided into normal, sham, model, TLJN min, TLJN max and donepezil hydrochloride groups. Spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance behavior, which are regarded as measures of spatial learning and memory, were investigated using Y-maze testing. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to observe the therapeutic effect of TLJN on the deposits of amyloid plaque and on the expression of synaptophysin, insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin. RESULTS: Y-maze results showed that the AD model group presented with spatial learning and memory impairments. Hematoxylin-eosin and Congo red staining indicated neuronal impairment and deposits of amyloid plaque in the model group and these results were consistent with their learning and memory deficits in the Y-maze. The TLJN-treated groups exhibited prolonged a cavity delitescence, decreased arm entries and improvement in learning and memory. Moreover, the structure of the neurons of the treated groups was restored and the expression of synaptophysin increased in both the hippocampus and cortex. In addition, their levels of insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin in the cortex and hippocampus were upregulated and the amyloid plaque was decreased. CONCLUSION: TLJN can improve learning and memory, up-regulate insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin levels, promote the degrading of Aβ and clear amyloid plaque from the AD rat brain. In future, TLJN may have significant therapeutic potential in the treatment of AD patients.

21762767|t|A modified formulation of Chinese traditional medicine improves memory impairment and reduces Aβ level in the Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
21762767|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: SuHeXiang Wan (SHXW), a Chinese traditional medicine has been used orally for the treatment of seizures, infantile convulsion, stroke and so forth. Previously, we reported the effects of modified SHXW essential oil mixture of the fragrance containing herbs on the sedative effect, anticonvulsant property and antioxidative activity after fragrance inhalation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was undertaken to evaluate beneficial effects of a modified recipe of SHXW (termed as KSOP1009) consisting of a ethanol extract of 8 herbs including resin of Liquidambar orientalis Miller, seed of Myristica fragrans Houtt., rhizome of Cnidium officinale Makino, lumber of Santalum album L., fructus of Piper longum L., flower buds of Eugenia caryophyllata Merrill et Perry, pollen of Typha orientalis Presl., and root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge in the neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The transgenic mice of AD, Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9, were fed KSOP1009 or as a positive control, donepezil for 3 months from 4.5 months of age. Behavioral, immunological and ELISA analyses were used to assess memory impairment, Aβ accumulation and plaque deposition in the brain. Other in vitro works were performed to examine whether KSOP1009 inhibits the Aβ(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y cells. RESULTS: Intake of KSOP1009 improved the Aβ-induced memory impairment and suppressed Aβ levels and plaque deposition in the brain of Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9 mice as much as that of donepezil treatment. KSOP1009 prevented the down-regulation of phospho-CREB and increased AKT phosphorylation in the AD-like brains. Moreover, KSOP1009 suppresses Aβ-induced apoptosis and ROS production in SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that KSOP1009 may develop as a therapeutic drug for treatment of AD patients.

22360046|t|Use of traditional Chinese medication for post-stroke recovery.
21796302|t|Traditional Chinese medicine, a solution for reducing dual stroke risk factors at once?
21796302|a|Based on genome wide association studies (GWAS), the activities of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) and 5-Lipoxygenase activating protein (ALOX5AP) were suggested as two of the major factors involved in ischemic stroke risks. Uncontrolled PDE4D activities often lead to cAMP-induced stroke and cardiovascular diseases. Overexpression of ALOX5AP, on the other hand, had been shown to play a major role in inflammation pathway that could induce the development of atherosclerosis and stroke. To eliminate the risk factors that lead to stroke, we reported the identification and analysis of dual-targeting compounds that could reduce PDE4D and ALOX5AP activities from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We employed world's largest TCM database, TCM Database@Taiwan, for in silico drug identification. We also introduced machine learning predictive models, as well as pharmacophore model, for characterizing the drug-like candidates. Both myristic acid and pentadecanoic acid were identified. The follow-up analysis on molecular dynamics simulation further determined the major roles of the carboxyl group for forming stable molecular interactions. Intriguingly, the carboxyl group demonstrated different bonding patterns with PDE4D and ALOX5AP, through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds, respectively. In addition, the large volume occupied by the ligand hydrophobic regions could achieve inhibition through occupying the vacant spaces in the binding site. These pharmacophores held true for both candidates against each protein targets. Hence, we proposed the presence of the carboxyl group and hydrophobic regions as potent dual targeting features that inhibit both PDE4D and ALOX5AP activities.

21776525|t|In silico pharmacology suggests ginger extracts may reduce stroke risks.
21776525|a|Aberrations in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling cascade has been linked to the allergic responses that associate with the risks of stroke or cardiovascular diseases. Phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) has been shown to be highly involved in cAMP regulation and is hence implied to be a potential drug target in stroke prevention. To identify potential PDE4D inhibitors from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), we employed machine learning modeling techniques to screen a comprehensive TCM database. The multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector machine (SVM) models constructed have correlation coefficients of 0.8234 and 0.7854 respectively. Three candidates from the ginger family were identified based on the prediction models. Molecular dynamics simulation further validated the binding stabilities of each candidate in comparison to the control inhibitor L-454560. The intermolecular distances suggested that the candidates could hinder PDE4D from binding to cAMP. Furthermore, the HypoGen validation suggested that top2, top3, and the control L-454560 mapped with the predicted pharmacophores. The results suggested that the 3 compounds identified from the ginger family were capable in inhibiting cAMP binding and hydrolysis by PDE4D. We further identified and characterized the ligand binding properties that are associated with the inhibition of PDE4D.

21605573|t|MLC901, a traditional Chinese medicine protects the brain against global ischemia.
21605573|a|Global ischemia leads to damage in the hippocampal CA1 region and is associated with behavioral deficits. NeuroAid (MLC601 and MLC901), a Traditional Chinese Medicine is used in China for patients after stroke. We have investigated here the effects of MLC901 on brain injury and deficits after global ischemia in the rat. Global ischemia induced by four-vessel occlusion resulted in degeneration of CA1 neurons. MLC901 (0.074 mg/ml) prevented both necrosis and apoptosis of neurons up to 3 h after ischemia. These positive MLC901 effects were associated with a decrease in Bax expression and in levels of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde. Using the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 we also demonstrated the critical role of the Akt pathway in MLC901-mediated neuroprotection. MLC901 enhanced neurogenesis. Furthermore, MLC901 improved functional recovery of rats after global ischemia as assessed by the Morris water maze. In this test MLC901 reduced the increase in escape latency and in swim distance induced by ischemia. MLC901 also improved post-ischemic grip strength. If observations made with rats can be extended to humans, then MLC901 will represent a novel therapeutic strategy after cardiac arrest with a clinically interesting time window of protection.

22013790|t|[Effects of integrative medicine protocols on the improvement of neural function deficit and disability outcomes in patients with acute ischemic cerebral stroke].
22013790|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of integrative medicine protocols on the neural function deficit and short-term disability outcomes in patients with acute ischemic cerebral stroke. METHODS: 99 patients were randomly assigned to three groups, i.e., the Dengzhan Xixin (fleabane) group (Group A), the Kudiezi (sowthistle-leaf ixeris seedling) group (Group B), and the Western medicine control group (Group C). Dengzhan Xixin Injection was intravenously dripped to patients in Group A for 14 days. Chinese decoction was administered to them by pattern typing as well. Meanwhile, they took Dengzhan Shengmai Capsule for two months. Kudiezi Injection was intravenously dripped to patients in Group B for 14 days. Chinese decoction was administered to them by pattern typing as well. Meanwhile, they took Naoshuantong Capsule for two months. In addition to internal therapies, patients in Group A and B received acupuncture, massage, and external washing with Chinese medicine for 21 days. Patients in Group C also received modem rehabilitation therapy for 21 days, including rehabilitation training and electronic stimulus in addition to the internal medicine. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and disability outcome (modified Rank Scale, mRS) were taken as main effect indices. RESULTS: The NIHSS scores at each time point obviously decreased more than before treatment in all the three groups (P<0.01), but with no difference at each time point (P>0.05). The disability outcomes of all the three groups postponed as time went by. Significant difference existed among the three groups by log-lineal model (CATMOD) (P<0.05). The best effect was shown in Group B, with the markedly effective rate of 19. 35% and the total effective rate 54.84%. CONCLUSIONS: The integrative medicine protocols could improve the nerve functions of ischemic stroke patients. Therefore, it could improve the disability outcomes. The comprehensive protocol (Kudiezi Injection + Naoshuantong Capsule + Chinese decoction according to pattern typing + acupuncture + massage + external washing with Chinese medicine) was better.

22256767|t|[Effects of aromatic resuscitation drugs on blood brain barrier in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model rats].
22256767|a|OBJECTIVE: To research the effects of moschus, borneol, styrax and benzoinum on the structure and function of blood brain barrier in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model rats. METHOD: Focal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was introduced as an in vivo ischemic model in rats. After 2 h MCAO, nylon suture was pulled up 1 cm to give blood reperfusion. After 22 h reperfusion, all animals were decapitated. The ultramicrostructure of blood brain barrier of ischemia hemisphere side in fronto-parietal cortex region by transmission electron microscope, and the content of VEGF and MMP-9 in ischemia side brain tissue were measured by ELISA. RESULT: In model and solvent group rats, the capillary endothelium cells, astro-glial cells and nerve cells in ischemia hemisphere side in fronto-parietal region were emerged in different degree compared with sham-operated groups, which exhibited tight junction between endothelial cells being opened, basal lamina being dissolved, and permeability increasing, and cellularedema. In borneol (0.2 g x kg(-1)) group rats, the structure of three kinds of cells were nearly normal, which tight junction structure was clear, rough endoplasmic reticulum and polyribosome could be found in cytoplasm. In moschus (66.6 mg x kg(-1)) group rats, the structure of capillary endothelium cells and astrocytes were nearly normal as well as the basal lamina, but the electrons in neurons was maldistribution. In styrax (1.332 g x kg(-1)) group rats, astrocytes were nearly normal, while capillary endothelial cells and neurons exhibited oedema in different degrees. And the basal lamina was discontinuous, augmentation of cell spaces in endothelial cells increased the permeability, some endoplasmic reticulum broadened and ribosome ablated. In benzoinum (1.0 g x kg(-1)) group rats, oedema of capillary endothelial cells and astrocytes was significant, basal lamina broke. Meanwhile endoplasmic reticulum broadened as vacuole, the number of ribosome in rough endoplasmic reticulum decreased, crista mitochondriales in some neurons disappeared as vacuole which hint oedema happened. Results also showed that borneol decrease the level of VEGF in ischemia side brain tissue significantly, while has little influence on the level of MMP-9. Moschus showed the tendency to decrease the level of VEGF and MMP-9 in ischemia side brain tissue. CONCLUSION: Aromatic resuscitation drugs showed the protection effect on blood brain barrier in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury rats, which the protection effect of moschus and borneol were better than that of styrax and benzoinum. The mechanism of protection effect maybe related to decrease the level of VEGF and MMP-9.

21823154|t|Plasma tissue kallikrein level is negatively associated with incident and recurrent stroke: a multicenter case-control study in China.
21823154|a|OBJECTIVE: Tissue kallikrein (TK) cleaves kininogen to produce the potent bioactive compounds kinin and bradykinin, which lower blood pressure and protect the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels. Reduction in TK levels is associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes in animal models. In this study, we investigated the association of TK levels with event-free survival over 5 years in Chinese first-ever stroke patients. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study with 1,268 stroke patients (941 cerebral infarction, 327 cerebral hemorrhage) and 1,210 controls. Plasma TK levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We used logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relationship between TK levels and risk of first-time or recurrent stroke. RESULTS: Plasma TK levels were significantly lower in stroke patients (0.163 ± 0.064mg/l vs 0.252 ± 0.093mg/l, p < 0.001), especially those with ischemic stroke. After adjustment for traditional risk factors, plasma TK levels were negatively associated with the risk of first-ever stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.344; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.389; p < 0.001) and stroke recurrence and positively associated with event-free survival during 5 years of follow-up (relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74-0.90; p < 0.001). Compared with the first quartile of plasma TK levels, the ORs for first-ever stroke patients were as follows: second quartile, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.56-1.07); third quartile, 0.23 (95% CI, 0.17-0.32); fourth quartile, 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03-0.06). INTERPRETATION: Lower plasma TK levels are independently associated with first-ever stroke and are an independent predictor of recurrence after an initial stroke.

21244583|t|Analysis of thrombin-antithrombin complex contents in plasma and hematoma fluid of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage patients after clot removal.
21244583|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Animal experiments indicate that the cerebral thrombin is associated with secondary brain damage after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This study was aimed to investigate the concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) in hematoma fluid and plasma of the patients with ICH after surgery and analyze the correlation between TAT complex levels and severity of ICH. METHODS: Sixty patients with ICH were enrolled. Craniotomy for removal of intracranial blood clot was performed within 24h after ICH. Hematoma fluid and plasma were collected on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4. The plasma obtained from healthy subjects and cerebrospinal fluid from patients without cerebrovascular diseases served as controls, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the concentrations of TAT complex in the patients and controls. RESULTS: TAT complex concentrations in both postoperative plasma and hematoma fluid of patients with ICH were significantly higher than those of the controls (P<0.01). In patients with ICH, hematoma fluid had a higher TAT complex level than plasma (P<0.01). The preoperative hemorrhage volume and postoperative TAT complex levels in plasma and hematoma fluid correlated positively with National Institutes of Health stroke scale and negatively with Glasgow coma score (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that TAT complex levels of plasma and hematoma fluid correlate positively with the severity of ICH. Determination of the plasma TAT complex concentration is helpful for the evaluation of the severity of post-ICH brain injury.

21894686|t|[Randomized controlled study on rehabilitation of hemiplegia in cerebral infarction at the early stage with acupuncture and moxibustion based on meridian harmonization and zang-organ regulation].
21894686|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the better therapeutic method for the treatment of hemiplegia in cerebral infarction. METHODS: One hundred and fifty cases were randomized into a meridian-harmonization group (group A), a zang-organ regulation group (group B) and a meridian-harmonization and zang-organ regulation group (group C), 50 cases in each one. On the basis of conventional treatment, in group A, the acupoints were selected along meridians, such as Hegu (LI 4), Taichong (LR 3), Jianyu (LI 15), Waiguan (TE 5), Huantiao (GB 30) and Yanglingquan (GB 34)ect. In group B, the acupoints were selected in light of abdominal acupuncture such as Zhongwan (CV 12), Xiawan (CV 10), Qihai (CV 6), Guanyuan (CV 4), Shangqu (KI 17, healthy side) and Daheng (SP 15)etc. In group C, the acupoints in group A and group B were selected in combination. Before and after treatment, all the patients received the test of Barthel Index (BI) to assess the disability level and the simple Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale (FMMS) for the evaluation of motor function. RESULTS: After treatment, all the three groups presented the significant improvement of BI, the down-regulation of disability rate and up-regulation of FMMS score, indicating significant differences in statistics as compared with those before treatment (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In group C, the results of BI improvement, the down-regulation of disability rate and the improvement of limb motor function were all superior to those in either group A or group B (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture in light of meridian-harmonization and zang-organ regulation is the better approach for the early-stage rehabilitation of hemiplegia in cerebral infarction and its efficacy is superior to that of either simple meridian harmonization therapy or zang-organ regulation therapy.

21866661|t|[Proteomics study on the essence of wind syndrome caused by gan-yang hyperactivity in Chinese medicine].
21866661|a|OBJECTIVE: To preliminarily study the essence of wind syndrome caused by Gan-yang hyperactivity (WSGH) in Chinese medicine at the protein expression level. METHODS: WSGH was strictly differentiated from wind stirring due to yin deficiency syndrome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and those with cerebral infarction (CI); from Gan-yang hyperactivity syndrome in patients with cervical spondylosis (CS); from wind syndrome induced by blood deficiency in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) according to Chinese medicine syndrome typing standard. Control studies were performed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from all patients of the aforesaid syndromes and healthy subjects. The total proteins were extracted, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) conducted and analyzed by PDQuest software. The peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The SwissProt database was inquired using Mascot reference system. Proteins of different and same expressions in PBMCs of patients suffering from the same disease of different syndromes, different diseases of the same syndrome, and syndromes of the same kind were compared. RESULTS: The 2-DE map of PBMCs' total proteins in the aforesaid syndrome groups and healthy subjects was established. Through comparison, analysis, and appraisement, there was 1 protein dot of the same expression and 22 protein dots of different expressions between ICH patients of WSGH and ICH patients of wind stirring due to yin deficiency syndrome. There were 6 protein dots of the same expression and 21 protein dots of different expressions between CI patients of WSGH and CI patients of wind stirring due to yin deficiency syndrome. There were 3 protein dots of the same expression and 12 protein dots of different expressions between CS patients of WSGH and CS patients of Gan-yang hyperactivity syndrome. There was no protein dot of the same expression and 12 protein dots of different expressions between PD patients of WSGH and PD patients of wind syndrome induced by blood deficiency. There were 13 protein dots of the same expression in different diseases of the same syndrome. There was 1 protein dot (Thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, TPx) of the same expression in the four diseases of the same kind syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Different connotations of the essence existed (having multiple different protein expressions) in patients with the same disease of different syndromes. Syndromes of the same kind share the same material bases (having the same protein expression). These suggested that Chinese medicine syndrome has its own material bases and essence findable.

21524691|t|Neuroprotection of Scutellarin is mediated by inhibition of microglial inflammatory activation.
21524691|a|Inhibition of microglial over-reaction and the inflammatory processes may represent a therapeutic target to alleviate the progression of neurological diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. Scutellarin is the major active component of Erigeron breviscapus (Vant.) Hand-Mazz, a herbal medicine in treatment of cerebrovascular diseases for a long time in the Orient. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of neuroprotection by Scutellarin, particularly its anti-inflammatory effects in microglia. We observed that Scutellarin inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of proinflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suppressed LPS-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNFα, and IL-1β mRNA expression in rat primary microglia or BV-2 mouse microglial cell line. Scutellarin inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). It repressed the LPS-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 phosphorylation without affecting the activity of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase. Moreover, Scutellarin also inhibited interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced NO production, iNOS mRNA expression and transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1α (STAT1α) activation. Concomitantly, conditioned media from Scutellarin pretreated BV-2 cells significantly reduced neurotoxicity compared with conditioned media from LPS treated alone. Together, the present study reported the anti-inflammatory activity of Scutellarin in microglial cells along with their underlying molecular mechanisms, and suggested Scutellarin might have therapeutic potential for various microglia mediated neuroinflammation.

21398513|t|Treatment with Z-ligustilide, a component of Angelica sinensis, reduces brain injury after a subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats.
21398513|a|Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating stroke subtype accounting for approximately 3 to 7% of cases each year. Despite its rarity among the various stroke types, SAH is still responsible for approximately 25% of all stroke fatalities. Although various preventative and therapeutic interventions have been explored for potential neuroprotection after SAH, a considerable percentage of patients still experience serious neurologic and/or cognitive impairments as a result of the primary hemorrhage and/or secondary brain damage that occurs. Z-ligustilide (LIG), the primary lipophilic component of the Chinese traditional medicine radix Angelica sinensis, has been shown to reduce ischemic brain injury via antiapoptotic pathways. Accordingly, in our study, we investigated the neuroprotective potential of LIG after experimental SAH in rats. Rats with SAH that was induced using the established double hemorrhage model were studied with and without LIG treatment. Mortality, neurobehavioral evaluation, brain water content, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and vasospasm assessment of the basilar artery were measured on days 3 and 7 after injury. Additional testing was done to evaluate for apoptosis using TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling staining as well as immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to identify key proapoptotic/survival proteins, i.e., p53, Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3. The results showed that LIG treatment reduced mortality, neurobehavioral deficits, brain edema, BBB permeability, and cerebral vasospasm. In addition, treatment reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the surrounding brain injury site, which accompanied a marked down-regulation of proapoptotic proteins, p53, and cleaved caspase-3. Our data suggest that LIG may be an effective therapeutic modality for SAH victims by altering apoptotic mechanisms.

21672378|t|[A study of traditional Chinese medicine syndromes correlated to neurologic function or to coagulation function in patients with acute cerebral infarction].
21672378|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlations between traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome elements and neurologic function and between them and coagulation function in patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI). METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-three patients with ACI were enrolled. The syndromes of this disease were scored according to Stroke Diagnostic Criteria for Differentiation of Syndromes. Neurologic function deficit score (NDS) was scored according to stroke scale of the National Institutes of Health (NIHSS). The prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen (FIB) contents were detected. The correlations between TCM syndrome elements and NDS and between them and coagulation function were investigated. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-three patients with ACI were divided into six syndromes: wind syndrome (n=147, 65.92%), fire syndrome ( n=100, 44.84%), tan syndrome (n=123, 55.16%), blood stasis syndrome (n=78, 34.98%), deficiency of qi syndrome (n=31, 13.90%), and yin deficiency causing hyperactivity of yang syndrome (n=25, 11.21%). The wind, tan and fire syndromes were the main syndrome elements related to ACI. The scores of wind, fire, tan and deficiency of qi syndromes were positively related to NDS (r₁=0.207, P₁=0.002; r₂=0.284, P₂=0.000; r₃=0.245, P₃=0.000; r₄=0.152, P₄=0.023). The score of deficiency of qi syndrome was negatively correlated with PT (r=-0.170, P=0.011); and the scores of tan, blood stasis, and deficiency of qi syndromes were negatively correlated with APTT (r₁=-0.182, P₁=0.006; r₂=-0.148, P₂=0.027; r₃=-0.211, P₃=0.001).Other syndromes were not correlated to NDS or coagulation factors. CONCLUSION: The neurologic function deficiency due to ACI is more likely influenced by wind, tan, and fire syndromes; deficiency of qi syndrome also has some effects. The syndromes of tan, blood stasis, and deficiency of qi are closely correlated with coagulation function, and their scores may reflect the clotting function in patients with ACI.

21823415|t|[Effect on the motor function of stroke patients by combination of needling at Back-shu point and trunk exercise].
21823415|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect on the motor function of stroke patients by combination of needling at Back-shu point and trunk exercise. METHODS: Ninety stroke hemiplegic patients were randomly assigned to the conventional treatment group (as the convention group), the Back-shu point needling group, and the combination of Back-shu point needling and the trunk exercise group, 30 patients in each group. They were treated with the conventional treatment, needling at Back-shu point, and the combination of needling at Back-shu point and trunk exercise. The Fugl-Meyer score (FMA) and modified Barthel index (MBI) score were assessed before treatment and two months after treatment. RESULTS: The three rehabilitation treatment methods were all effective in improving the motor function of stroke hemiplegic patients (P<0.05). The effects in the Back-shu point needling group and the combination of Back-shu point needling and the trunk exercise group were respectively superior to that in the conventional treatment group (P<0.05). The effect in the combination of Back-shu point needling and the trunk exercise group was superior to that in the Back-shu point needling group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of Back-shu point needling and the trunk exercise could improve the motor function of stroke hemiplegic patients, and its effect was better than needling at Back-shu point alone.

21823413|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the therapeutic effect on dysphagia of the convalescent stroke by combination of the body acupuncture, the scalp acupuncture and the electric acupuncture could be better than that by routine rehabilitation training. METHODS: 148 patients with dysphagia of convalescent stroke were randomly assigned to the acupuncture group and rehabilitation group, 74 in each group. Fengchi (GB20), Wangu (GB12), Yifeng (SJ17), Lian-quan (RN23), Jinjin (EX-HN12), Yuye (EX-HN12) on the affected side were needled, and the scalp acupuncture was needled. The body acupuncture, the electric acupuncture, and the scalp acupuncture were applied in combination in the acupuncture group. The acupuncture was performed once a day, five times as one therapeutic course, 2 -4 courses totally. Rehabilitation training was performed by language therapists in the control group. The main outcomes were assessed with both intention-to-treat analysis and on-treatment/per-protocol analysis at the same time. The value of number needed to treat (NNT)/number needed to harm (NNH) and their 95% confidence intervals were also reported. The secondary outcomes were assessed by the end of the treatment. RESULTS: The recovery rate assessed by Watian swallowing ability, water drinking test in the acupuncture group were better than those of the control group by the end of the treatment and three months after treatment (P<0.05). There was no statistical significance in the pulmonary infection rate and the mortality or in the 6-month mortality after treatment by the end of the treatment between the two groups (P>0.05). The compliance was 100% in the two groups. No adverse reaction occurred in the acupuncture group. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture for dysphagia of convalescent stroke was better than routine rehabilitation training with safety and high tolerance.

21573109|t|Huangqi injection (a traditional Chinese patent medicine) for chronic heart failure: a systematic review.
21573109|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a global public health problem. Therefore, novel and effective drugs that show few side-effects are needed. Early literature studies indicated that Huangqi injection is one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese patent medicines for CHF in China. As a large number of clinical studies has been carried out and published, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Huangqi injection. Therefore, we carried out this systematic review under the support of the framework of the Joint Sino-Italian Laboratory (JoSIL). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Huangqi injection for CHF according to the available scientific knowledge. METHODS: An extensive search including PubMed, EMBASE, CBM, the Cochrane Library and Chinese literature databases was performed up to July 2008. Clinical trials regarding Huangqi injection for the treatment of CHF were searched for, irrespective of languages. The quality of each trial was assessed according to the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook 5.0, and RevMan 5.0 provided by the Cochrane Collaboration and STATA 9.2 were used for data analysis. RESULTS: After selection of 1,205 articles, 62 RCTs and quasi-RCTs conducted in China and published in Chinese journals were included in the review. The methodological quality of the trials was low. In most trials inclusion and exclusion criteria were not specified. Furthermore, only one study evaluated the outcomes for drug efficacy after an adequate period of time. For these reasons and because of the different baseline characteristics we did not conduct a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Although available studies are not adequate to draw a conclusion on the efficacy and safety of Huangqi injection (a traditional Chinese patent medicine), we hope that our work could provide useful experience on further studies on Huangqi injections. The overall level of TCM clinical research needs to be improved so that the efficacy of TCM can be evaluated by the international community and possibly some TCM can enter into the international market.

21279683|t|Effects of acupuncture on glycometabolic enzymes in multi-infarct dementia rats.
21279683|a|Acupuncture has exhibited therapeutic effects on vascular dementia in our previous research. The mechanism of its anti-dementia effects involves energy metabolism. For brain cells, glucose metabolism is almost the only source of energy, and glucose metabolism disorders are early signs of dementia. In addition, glucose metabolism associates closely with glycometabolic enzymes, thereby maintains normal energy supply in brains and neurological and mental activities. In order to investigate its anti-dementia mechanism, we studied the effects of acupuncture on behavior of multi-infarct dementia (MID) rats and glycometabolic enzymes protein expression and activities in their brains. Results showed acupuncture improved the cognitive disorder, and increased the activities of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase. Accordingly, it suggests that the anti-dementia effects of acupuncture may be mediated by up regulation of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase activities, influencing energy metabolic system and thus overcoming the dysfunctional cognition of MID.

21146552|t|Isolation and identification of anti-inflammatory constituents from Ligusticum chuanxiong and their underlying mechanisms of action on microglia.
21146552|a|Stroke is the third most common cause of death worldwide. Recent findings showed that the severity of cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic stroke correlates with inflammation mediated responses in the neural cells. During ischemia, inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and nitric oxide are produced by microglia, which play a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Ligusticum chuanxiong (LCX) is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for empiric treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases for many centuries. By applying a bioactivity-guided fractionation scheme, two compounds with inhibition on neuroinflammation were isolated from LCX. Using chromatographic and spectrometric methods, they were identified to be senkyunolide A and Z-ligustilide. They could inhibit the production of proinflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine BV-2 microglial cells and human peripheral blood monocyte derived macrophages. In addition, both compounds protected Neuro-2a cells from neuroinflammatory toxicity induced by the conditioned culture media produced by LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. The underlying mechanisms of action of senkyunolide A were further delineated. Its inhibitory effects were shown to be independent of the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). However, senkyunolide A could increase the degradation of TNF-α mRNA and reduce its half life by 43%. In conclusion, bioactivity-guided fractionation is an effective way of isolating bioactive compounds from medicinal herbs. In addition, senkyunolide A and Z-ligustilide isolated from LCX may be considered as potential complementary drug candidates for treating inflammatory processes associated with cerebrovascular diseases.

21511109|t|Regional left ventricular myocardial dysfunction as a predictor of incident cardiovascular events MESA (multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis).
21511109|a|OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the prognostic value of subclinical left ventricular (LV) regional myocardial dysfunction (RMD) measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among asymptomatic individuals. BACKGROUND: LV RMD, defined as segmental impairment in systolic wall thickening, predicts adverse events in patients with established cardiovascular disease. MRI is highly accurate for detecting subtle RMD, of which the prognostic significance in a large multiethnic asymptomatic population is not known. METHODS: We used MRI to evaluate baseline regional LV myocardial function and prospectively followed a multiethnic (African American, Caucasian, Chinese, and Hispanic) population-based sample of 4,510 men and women without cardiovascular disease for a mean of 4.6 years. Regional myocardial dysfunction was defined as the presence of impaired systolic wall thickening (<10th percentile of segment-specific population distribution) in ≥2 contiguous LV segments within any given coronary artery territory. RESULTS: Baseline prevalence of RMD was 25.6%. Heart failure developed in 34 (1.0%) and 30 (2.6%) participants without and with RMD, respectively (p < 0.001). After adjustment for demographics and traditional risk factors, RMD remained independently associated with incident heart failure (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56 to 4.39; p < 0.001). The relationship persisted after further adjustment for biomarkers of reported association with cardiovascular disease and indexes of global LV systolic dysfunction and hypertrophy (HR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; p = 0.044). Similarly, RMD independently conferred an increased risk for hard coronary events (myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease; HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.89; p = 0.029), the composite of hard coronary events and stroke (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.16 to 2.56; p = 0.005), and all atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.07; p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Among an asymptomatic multiethnic American cohort, RMD is an independent predictor beyond traditional risk factors and global LV assessment for incident heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. The clinical utility of early recognition of this subclinical phenotype deserves further investigation. (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [MESA]; NCT00005487).

21315142|t|Traditional Chinese medicine, Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu decoction, potentiates tissue plasminogen activator against thromboembolic stroke in rats.
21315142|a|AIM OF THIS STUDY: The Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu decoction (XFZYD) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine for treating cardiovascular diseases. The therapeutic effects of this XFZYD have been well documented especially in treating of atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia. Since this decoction can induce endothelial progenitor cell angiogenesis, it can provide experimental evidence for the treatment of ischemic diseases. Patients who are admitted to the hospital with acute ischemic stroke are initially considered candidates for the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). However, rt-PA therapy is still lesser than ideal due to its major side effect of hemorrhaging. Therefore, medical research has been devoted to finding an alternative and/or complementary therapy for ischemic stroke. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effect of the combination of XFZYD with or without rt-PA in a rat model of thromboembolic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cerebral thromboembolic stroke animal model and immunoblotting analysis were used to assess the effects of XFZYD and rt-PA. RESULTS: Treatment with rt-PA (8 mg/kg) or XFZYD (1.5 and 3.0 g/kg/day) alone showed slight reductions in the infarct volume compared to solvent-treated rats. However, XFZYD (1.5 and 3.0 g/kg/day) obviously potentiated rt-PA-mediated reduction in the infarct volume in cerebral ischemic regions. In addition, treatment with rt-PA significantly reduced both tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) but not hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 α or active caspase-3 expressions in ischemic regions, whereas treatment with XFZYD (3.0 g/kg/day) significantly reduced all of these protein expressions in ischemic regions. Moreover, treatment with XFZYD (1.5 and 3.0 g/kg/day) obviously potentiated rt-PA-mediated reductions in TNF-α, iNOS, HIF-1 α, and active caspase-3 expressions. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that XFZYD potentiated rt-PA-mediated neuroprotection against thromboembolic stroke in rats. This neuroprotection is probably mediated by the inhibition of HIF-1 α and TNF-α, followed by the inhibition of inflammatory responses (i.e., iNOS) and apoptosis (active caspase-3). These results provide a better understanding of the scientific validation of the therapeutic value of the combination of XFZYD with rt-PA in ischemic stroke.

21447605|t|Distribution of ankle--brachial index and the risk factors of peripheral artery disease in a multi-ethnic Asian population.
21447605|a|Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We describe the prevalence and risk factors of PAD in a multi-ethnic Asian population (Chinese, Malays and Indians) in Singapore. The Singapore Prospective Study Program recruited 4132 individuals between 2004 and 2006 in which the ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured using the Smartdop™ 20EX bi-directional blood flow detector. PAD was defined as ≤ 0.9 and a high ABI > 1.4, with ABI 1.11-1.20 as reference. The mean age (SD) of individuals in the study was 49.9 (11.8) years, with 51.8% females. PAD was present in 4.3% of the population and a high ABI (> 1.4) was rare. Malays and Indians had a higher risk (especially in females). Compared to those with an ABI between 1.11 and 1.20, those with PAD were more likely to be of Malay and Indian ethnicity, female sex, with higher systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, with increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, albuminuria and renal impairment, and with a past history of stroke. In conclusion, in this large multi-ethnic Asian population, we document the distribution and risk factor associations for PAD. PAD shows an ethnic distribution similar to that of coronary artery disease in Singapore, with differences in sex distribution. Apart from traditional vascular risk factors, pulse pressure, renal impairment and a past history of stroke are important determinants of PAD.

21232529|t|Neuroprotective effect of sophocarpine against transient focal cerebral ischemia via down-regulation of the acid-sensing ion channel 1 in rats.
21232529|a|Sophocarpine, one of the major alkaloid compounds isolated from Sophora pachycarpa, is highly valued and important in traditional Chinese medicine. In the present study, we aimed to explore the possible mechanisms underlying sophocarpine-mediated neuroprotection against transient focal cerebral ischemia. Sophocarpine (5, 10, or 20mg/kg) was given 30min before focal ischemia was induced in rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. After sophocarpine treatment, the total infarct volume was significantly decreased in comparison to the ischemia-reperfusion values. The results of a neurological evaluation were significantly improved in the sophocarpine treated group when compared to controls. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced compared to the untreated ischemic group. Results of Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining indicated that pretreatment with sophocarpine down-regulated the expression of acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1) in the ischemic cortex. These results suggest that sophocarpine ameliorated the ischemic injury induced by transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats and that this neuroprotective effect might be related to the anti-ASIC1 channel and anti-apoptotic action of sophocarpine.

21328272|t|Shengmai (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) for heart failure.
21328272|a|BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a major public health problem worldwide. Shengmai (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) has long been used as a complementary treatment for heart failure in China. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects (both benefits and harms) of Shengmai plus usual treatment versus usual treatment alone for heart failure. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched CENTRAL and DARE on The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2008), EMBASE (1984 to August 2008), AMED (1985 to August 2008) and BIOSIS (1997 to August 2008) and CBM (1978 to August 2008). We added two new Chinese databases for the update; VIP (1989 to September 2008) and CNKI (1979 to September 2008). We also handsearched Chinese journals. No language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Shengmai plus usual treatment versus usual treatment alone or Shengmai versus placebo for heart failure, irrespective of blinding status, were included. More stringent inclusion criteria were applied in this update and only studies that have a clear description of randomisation methods are classed as true RCTs and hence included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Dichotomous and continuous data were calculated as relative risk (RR), and mean differences (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD). Random-effect model and fixed-effect model were used to perform meta-analysis for with and without heterogeneity respectively. MAIN RESULTS: Only six RCTs with a total of 440 patients were included in this updated review. Compared to usual treatment alone, Shengmai plus usual treatment in five trials indicated an improvement in NYHA classification (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.54). Other benefits were observed, but were limited to low patient numbers and significant heterogeneity: ejection fraction, cardiac output, stroke volume, exercise test and ratio of peak early to late diastolic filling velocity. Only one RCT with 40 patients compared Shengmai to placebo, and improvements were seen in stroke volume, Heath and Cardic index and myocardial contractility. Two studies reported mild adverse effects, but no patients were withdrawn or needed medication due to these adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Shengmai may be beneficial for heart failure compared to placebo or plus usual treatment compared to usual treatment alone. However, long-term and more high quality studies are needed to provide clear evidence for the future use of Shengmai.

20851810|t|Baicalin increases VEGF expression and angiogenesis by activating the ERR{alpha}/PGC-1{alpha} pathway.
20851810|a|AIMS: Baicalin is the major component found in Scutellaria baicalensis root, a widely used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. Although it has been used for thousands of years to treat stroke, the mechanisms of action of S. baicalensis have not been clearly elucidated. In this report, we studied the modulation of angiogenesis as one possible mechanism by investigating the effects of these agents on expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a critical factor for angiogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of baicalin and an extract of S. baicalensis on VEGF expression were tested in several cell lines. Both agents induced VEGF expression in all cells without increasing expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). The expression of reporter genes was also activated under the control of the VEGF promoter containing either a functional or a defective HIF response element (HRE). Only minimal effects were observed on reporter activation under the HRE promoter. Instead, both agents significantly induced oestrogen-related receptor (ERRα) expression as well as the activity of reporter genes under the control of ERRα-binding element. Their ability to induce VEGF expression was suppressed once ERRα expression was knocked down by siRNA or ERRα-binding sites were deleted in the VEGF promoter. We also found that both agents stimulated cell migration and vessel sprout formation from the aorta. CONCLUSION: Our results implicate baicalin and S. baicalensis in angiogenesis by inducing VEGF expression through the activation of the ERRα pathway. These data may facilitate a better understanding of the potential health benefits of these agents in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

21266291|t|Advance directive and end-of-life care preferences among Chinese nursing home residents in Hong Kong.
21266291|a|OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present study were to describe the knowledge and preferences of Hong Kong Chinese older adults regarding advance directives and end-of-life care decisions, and to investigate the predictors of preferences for advance directive and community end-of-life care in nursing homes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey conducted in 140 nursing homes in Hong Kong. A total of 1600 cognitively normal Chinese older adults were recruited. Information on demographics, social, medical diseases, preferences of end-of-life care decisions, and advance directives were collected by face-to-face questionnaire interviews. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 82.4 years; 94.2% of them would prefer to be informed of the diagnosis if they had terminal diseases and 88.0% preferred to have their advance directives regarding medical treatment in the future. Approximately 35% would prefer to die in their nursing homes. The significant independent predictors for the preference of advance directive included asking for relatives' advice, wishing to be informed of their terminal illness diagnoses, absence of stroke, and having no problems in self-care in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions. For the preference for community end-of-life care and dying in nursing homes, the independent predictors included older age, not having siblings in Hong Kong, Catholic religion, nonbeliever of traditional Chinese religion, not receiving any old age allowance, lower Geriatric Depression Scale score, and being residents of government-subsidized nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS: Most of our cognitively normal Chinese nursing home older adults prefer having an advance directive, and one-third of them would prefer to die in nursing homes.

21425573|t|[Effect of integrative medical therapy on the prognosis of patients suffering from yin syndrome type acute ischemic stroke].
21425573|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of integrative medical therapy on the prognosis of patients suffering from yin syndrome type acute ischemic stroke (YS-AIS). METHODS: A multi-center, prospective, random and parallel controlled clinical trial was carried on 606 patients of YS-AIS. Excepting the 15 patients being excluded and dropped out in the trial period, all patients were assigned to the treatment group (274 patients) treated with integrated medical protocol (i. e. Chinese medical therapy plus conventional Western medical treatment), and the control group (263 patients) treated with conventional Western medical treatment plus placebo. Patients' quality of life (QOL) and their disability level were assessed by scoring based on SS-QOL and modified Rankin scale (mRS) respectively at the terminal of the 21-day treatment (T1) and at the ends of 60-day (T2) and 90-day (T3) following-ups. RESULTS: Patients' disability level, showed by mRS scores, was not significantly different between the two groups at T1 and T2 (P > 0.05), but with significant difference at T3 (P < 0.05). The recovery in the treatment group were more significant. Although the SS-QOL scores showed no statistical significant difference between groups (P > 0.05), improvement of QOL could be seen in the treatment group and the difference between groups was more significant as the time went by. CONCLUSION: Integrative medical therapy could reduce the severe disability rate in patients after YS-AIS, and showed an improving trend on patients' QOL at T3.

21276264|t|Current management of intracerebral haemorrhage in China: a national, multi-centre, hospital register study.
21276264|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine current practice of the management and secondary prevention of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) in China where the disease is more common than in Western populations. METHODS: Data on baseline characteristics, management in-hospital and post-stroke, and outcome of ICH patients are from the ChinaQUEST (QUality Evaluation of Stroke Care and Treatment) study, a multi-centre, prospective, 62 hospital registry in China during 2006-07. RESULTS: Nearly all ICH patients (n = 1572) received an intravenous haemodiluting agent such as mannitol (96%) or a neuroprotectant (72%), and there was high use of intravenous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (42%). Neurosurgery was undertaken in 137 (9%) patients; being overweight, having a low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission, and Total Anterior Circulation Syndrome (TACS) clinical pattern on admission, were the only baseline factors associated with this intervention in multivariate analyses. Neurosurgery was associated with nearly three times higher risk of death/disability at 3 months post-stroke (odd ratio [OR] 2.60, p < 0.001). Continuation of antihypertensives in-hospital and at 3 and 12 months post-stroke was reported in 732/935 (78%), 775/935 (83%), and 752/935 (80%) living patients with hypertension, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The management of ICH in China is characterised by high rates of use of intravenous haemodiluting agents, neuroprotectants, and TCM, and of antihypertensives for secondary prevention. The controversial efficacy of these therapies, coupled with the current lack of treatments of proven benefit, is a call for action for more outcomes based research in ICH.

21905282|t|SuHeXiang Wan essential oil alleviates amyloid beta induced memory impairment through inhibition of tau protein phosphorylation in mice.
21905282|a|SuHeXiang Wan (SHXW), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used orally for the treatment of seizures, infantile convulsions and stroke. Previously, we reported the effects of a modified SHXW essential oil in terms of sedative effect, anticonvulsant activity and antioxidative activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of SHXW essential oil in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). SHXW essential oil was extracted from nine herbs. The mouse AD model was induced by a single injection of amyloid β protein (Aβ(1-42)) into the hippocampus. The animals were divided into four groups, the negative control group injected with Aβ(42-1), the Aβ group injected with Aβ(1-42), the SHXW group inhaled SHXW essential oil and received Aβ(1-42) injection, and the positive control group administered with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 10 mg/kg) and with subsequent Aβ(1-42) injection. Mice were analyzed by behavioral tests and immunological examination in the hippocampus. An additional in vitro investigation was performed to examine whether SHXW essential oil inhibits Aβ(1-42) induced neurotoxicity in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y cells. Pre-inhalation of SHXW essential oil improved the Aβ(1-42) induced memory impairment and suppressed Aβ(1-42) induced JNK, p38 and Tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus. SHXW essential oil suppressed Aβ-induced apoptosis and ROS production via an up-regulation of HO-1 and Nrf2 expression in SH-SY5Y cells. The present study suggests that SHXW essential oil may have potential as a therapeutic inhalation drug for the prevention and treatment of AD.

22156035|t|Using a blood pressure harmonic variability index to monitor the cerebral blood flow condition in stroke patients.
22156035|a|OBJECTIVE: Beat-to-beat cardiovascular variability analysis provides important information on the autonomic control. Bilateral radial arterial blood pressure waveforms (BPW) in stroke patients were compared to explore the efficacy of frequency-domain variability index in evaluating bilateral differences in the cerebral blood-flow condition. METHODS: Five-minute BPW signals were obtained in 22 stroke patients (Group S) and 21 healthy volunteers (control Group C). Amplitude proportions of the acquired pulses and their coefficient of variance (CVn) were calculated for 1st-10th harmonics to evaluate the blood pressure harmonic variability (BPHV). RESULTS: In Group S, CV1-CV7 were significantly larger on the stroke side than on the contralateral side. CV1, CV3-CV5 and CV7 were significantly larger on the stroke side in Group S than on either side in Group C. CONCLUSIONS: We first demonstrate the feasibility of using BPHV index to noninvasively detect the bilateral difference in cerebral vascular resistance in stroke patients. Two main indexes could be developed based on the present results: (1) bilateral differences in BPHV in stroke patients; (2) BPHV differences between normal and stroke subjects. It might have meaning in developing an easy-to-perform, noninvasive and continuous monitoring technique to improve the early detection and disease progress monitoring for stroke.

21240762|t|Relationship between HPLC fingerprints and in vivo pharmacological effects of a traditional Chinese medicine: Radix Angelicae Dahuricae.
21240762|a|We report the fingerprint development of a traditional Chinese medicine Radix Angelicae Dahuricae root and the correlation of the fingerprint peaks with its in vivo pharmacological effects. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods with the computer aided similarity evaluation were validated and used in serial pharmacological studies in mice. The major constituents of R. Angelicae Dahuricae were successfully separated by the HPLC methods, and the effects of sedation and analgesia were mainly related to the chromatographic peaks of group II. The anti-inflammatory, anti-heat stroke and anti-endotoxemic effects were mainly related to the peaks in group III. These results indicated a correlation between the HPLC fingerprints in groups and the pharmacological effects of R. Angelicae Dahuricae. This simple and accurate method can be used for the identification of the active components of R. Angelicae Dahuricae and for the quality control of its pharmaceutical preparations.

20546685|t|Angiogenesis and improved cerebral blood flow in the ischemic boundary area were detected after electroacupuncture treatment to rats with ischemic stroke.
20546685|a|OBJECTIVES: Acupuncture has been known to be effective in cerebral ischemia, and promoting angiogenesis is considered as a potential therapy of ischemic stroke. Recent data have also shown that angiogenesis indeed brings benefit to cerebral circulation and behavior improvement. We examined the effect of electroacupuncture on vascular endothelial cell proliferation in the ischemic stroke model. METHODS: A local ischemia was induced using the method of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rat. Rats were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (with MCAO) and the electroacupuncture group (with MCAO+electroacupuncture). The vascular endothelial cell (EC) proliferation were stained by double-immunofluorescence labeling method (Ki67 and vWF), region cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF), and the neurological scores was assessed. Electroacupuncture stimulation was applied to the acupoint GV26 (Shuigou) during the occlusion period. RESULTS: In the control group, the EC proliferation started at 24 hours, was sustained for at least 7 days with a maximum induction at 3 days, decreased thereafter at 7 days, and was absent at 12 days after MCAO. However, EC proliferation started at 12 hours after MCAO in electroacupuncture group, and increased significantly in the number of cells at 1, 2, 3, and 7 days compared with control group (P<0.01). Electroacupuncture increased significantly the rCBF, and reduced markedly the neurological scores compared with control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: This result suggests that the effect of electroacupuncture might be closely associated with promoting angiogenesis in the cerebral ischemic condition.

21776364|t|Safety and Efficacy of MLC601 in Iranian Patients after Stroke: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.
21776364|a|Objective. To investigate the safety and efficacy of MLC601 (NeuroAid) as a traditional Chinese medicine on motor recovery after ischemic stroke. Methods. This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on 150 patients with a recent (less than 3 month) ischemic stroke. All patients were given either MLC601 (100 patients) or placebo (50 patients), 4 capsules 3 times a day, as an add-on to standard stroke treatment for 3 months. Results. Sex, age, elapsed time from stroke onset, and risk factors in the treatment group were not significantly different from placebo group at baseline (P > .05). Repeated measures analysis showed that Fugl-Meyer assessment was significantly higher in the treatment group during 12 weeks after stroke (P < .001). Good tolerability to treatment was shown, and adverse events were mild and transient. Conclusion. MLC601 showed better motor recovery than placebo and was safe on top of standard ischemic stroke medications especially in the severe and moderate cases.

21108840|t|Chungsim-Yeunja-Tang decreases the inflammatory response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with cerebral infarction through an NF-κB dependent mechanism.
21108840|a|BACKGROUND: Chungsim-Yeunja-Tang (CYT) has been used as a medicine for cerebral infarction (CI) patients in Korea. The objective of this study was to determine precisely the effect of CYT on CI patients using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). METHODS: For a clinical study, 47 CI patients were identified who had taken CYT (0.01 g/kg) 3 times a day after meals for 2 weeks by oral administration. For ex vivo experiments, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from CI patients. We analyzed the effect of CYT and its main components on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine production and mechanism on PBMCs of CI patients by using ELISA, western blot analysis, transcription factor enzyme-linked immunoassay, and caspase assay. RESULTS: Clinical signs of CI significantly disappeared about 2 weeks after oral administration of CYT to CI patients (P < 0.05). CYT and quercetin, an active compound of CYT, significantly inhibited LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production and expression in PBMCs. CYT and quercetin also inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding activities of nuclear factor-κB and degradation of IκBα. In addition, CYT and quercetin inhibited LPS-induced IL-32 expression and caspase-1 activation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a mechanism that might explain the beneficial effect of CYT in treating CI patients. Taken together, our findings indicate that inhibition of IL-32 expression and caspase-1 activation may be a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target in CI.

21275163|t|[Relationship between tongue presentations and serum level of C-reactive protein in patients with acute cerebral infarction].
21275163|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between tongue presentations and the serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI). METHODS: Tongue presentations of 200 incipient unilateral ACI patients were observed, their serum CRP level was determined, and the relationship between the two entries was analyzed. RESULTS: Serum level of CRP in patients with thick tongue coating were significantly more than those with thin coating (117 cases vs. 73 cases); tongue coating was greasy in 149 patients and un-greasy in 51 patients. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the serum level of CRP was positively correlated with the thickness of tongue coating (r = 0.186, P = 0.008); also with the greasy degree. The difference of CRP levels in patients with different color and dryness of tongue was insignificant statistically (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Correlation between tongue presentations and serum CRP level is possibly existed in patients with ACI.

21275162|t|[Effects of Huatan Tongluo Granule on SOCS-3 and TNF-alpha expressions in patients with acute cerebral infarction].
21275162|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Huatan Tongluo Granule (HTG) on the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI) of phlegm-wind-stasis obstruction (PWSO) syndrome type. METHODS: Sixty-six ACI patients of PWSO type admitted within 72 h were randomized into the treatment group (34 cases) and the control group (32 cases), they were treated with foundational therapeutics, but HTG was given additionally to patients in the treatment group. SOCS-3 expression was detected by ELISA before treatment (d0) and on the 3rd (d3) and 7th day (d7) of treatment; TNF-alpha expression was detected by chemiluminescence at dO and d7. Data were compared with the respective parameters obtained from 20 healthy persons as normal control. Meantime, the degree of neuro-deficit in the two groups was evaluated by NIH Stroke scale and Barthel index on d0, d7, d14 and d21. RESULTS: SOCS-3 expression at d0, d3, d7; and TNF-alpha expression at d0, d7 were higher in the two patients' groups significantly than in normal controls (P < 0.05). As compared with the control group, on d7, SOCS-3 expression was higher (360.98 +/- 123.31 ng/L vs. 281.87 +/- 133.66 ng/L) and TNF-alpha expression was lower (35.72 +/- 19.94 ng/L vs. 49.86 +/- 34.79 ng/L), while the NIHSS score on d7 and d14, as well as the Barthel index on d14 and d21 were lower in the treatment group (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The acting mechanism of HTG for promoting nerve function recovery of ACI patients is possibly and closely related with the up-regulation of the inflammation suppressive factor SOCS-3, the down-regulation of the inflammation promoting factor TNF-alpha, and the elimination of secondary inflammatory injury after cerebral ischemia.

20951328|t|The ankle-brachial index and incident cardiovascular events in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis).
20951328|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the association of both a low and a high ankle-brachial index (ABI) with incident cardiovascular events in a multiethnic cohort. BACKGROUND: Abnormal ABIs, both low and high, are associated with elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, it is unknown whether this association is consistent across different ethnic groups, and whether it is independent of both newer biomarkers and other measures of subclinical atherosclerotic CVD. METHODS: A total of 6,647 non-Hispanic white, African-American, Hispanic, and Chinese men and women age 45 to 84 years from free-living populations in 6 U.S. field centers and free of clinical CVD at baseline had extensive measures of traditional and newer biomarker risk factors, and measures of subclinical CVD, including the ABI. Incident CVD, defined as coronary disease, stroke, or other atherosclerotic CVD death, was determined over a mean follow-up of 5.3 years. RESULTS: Both a low (<1.00) and a high (≥1.40) ABI were associated with incident CVD events. Sex- and ethnic-specific analyses showed consistent results. Hazard ratios were 1.77 (p<0.001) for a low and 1.85 (p=0.050) for a high ABI after adjustment for both traditional and newer biomarker CVD risk factors, and the ABI significantly improved risk discrimination. Further adjustment for coronary artery calcium score, common and internal carotid intimal medial thickness, and major electrocardiographic abnormalities only modestly attenuated these hazard ratios. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, both a low and a high ABI were associated with elevated CVD risk in persons free of known CVD, independent of standard and novel risk factors, and independent of other measures of subclinical CVD. Further research should address the cost effectiveness of measuring the ABI in targeted population groups.

20955613|t|Protective effect of extract of Cordyceps sinensis in middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
20955613|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemic hypoxic brain injury often causes irreversible brain damage. The lack of effective and widely applicable pharmacological treatments for ischemic stroke patients may explain a growing interest in traditional medicines. From the point of view of "self-medication" or "preventive medicine," Cordyceps sinensis was used in the prevention of cerebral ischemia in this paper. METHODS: The right middle cerebral artery occlusion model was used in the study. The effects of Cordyceps sinensis (Caterpillar fungus) extract on mortality rate, neurobehavior, grip strength, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione content, Lipid Peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase activity, glutathione reductase activity, catalase activity, Na+K+ATPase activity and glutathione S transferase activity in a rat model were studied respectively. RESULTS: Cordyceps sinensis extract significantly improved the outcome in rats after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in terms of neurobehavioral function. At the same time, supplementation of Cordyceps sinensis extract significantly boosted the defense mechanism against cerebral ischemia by increasing antioxidants activity related to lesion pathogenesis. Restoration of the antioxidant homeostasis in the brain after reperfusion may have helped the brain recover from ischemic injury. CONCLUSIONS: These experimental results suggest that complement Cordyceps sinensis extract is protective after cerebral ischemia in specific way. The administration of Cordyceps sinensis extract significantly reduced focal cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. The defense mechanism against cerebral ischemia was by increasing antioxidants activity related to lesion pathogenesis.

21056842|t|A pilot study in acute subarachnoid haemorrhagic patients after aneurysm clipping with complementary therapies of Chinese medicine.
21056842|a|OBJECTIVES: Acute subarachnoid haemorrhage still has high mortality and morbidity despite the use of modern standard treatment. In Taiwan, complementary therapies of Chinese medicine are usually used to treat stroke patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of complementary therapies of Chinese medicine on patients with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage after aneurysm clipping. DESIGN: This study was designed as a pilot study. A total of 32 patients with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage were randomly assigned to either a Chinese herbs extra group (CH) in which the patients were given complementary therapies of Chinese medicine and standard treatment, or a standard treatment only group (ST) in which patients were given standard treatment only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glasgow Outcome Scale scores, which were assessed by an evaluator who was blinded to the groups, 3 months after admission, and total admission days including intensive care unit stay days. RESULTS: The average Glasgow Outcome Scale score 3 months after admission was 3.7±1.4 in the CH was greater than 3.0±1.7 in the ST (p=0.041). Average total admission days were 53.9±28.6 (median 61) in the ST longer than 28.1±19.1 (median 20.5) in the CH (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage is of value because they can increase Glasgow Outcome Scale scores 3 months after admission and also because they can reduce total admission days.

20854617|t|Age and gender variations in the management of ischaemic stroke in China.
20854617|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is a major health issue in China. AIMS: We aimed to describe the management of patients admitted to hospitals in China with acute ischaemic stroke, and to determine whether there were any differences by age and gender. METHODS: Using a multicentre prospective hospital register across all eight major economic (geographic) regions in China, data on the socioeconomic characteristics, medical history, clinical features, and in-hospital investigations, management, and outcomes were collected on consecutive patients with acute stroke due to cerebral ischaemia during a 5-month period in 2006. RESULTS: Overall, traditional Chinese medicine and neuroprotectant use were remarkably high, with nearly 80% of patients receiving the former and >70% receiving the latter in hospital. Length of hospital stay was also long (median duration 16-days). Multivariate analyses revealed no clinically important differences in management between the genders. For the age-specific analyses, there were significant trends of decreasing use of thrombolysis (P=0·04), warfarin (P=0·01), corticosteroids (P=0·03), and lipid-lowering therapy (P=0·001); however, more assisted feeding (P=0·004) and rising rates of disability and in-hospital complications occurred with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: New information is provided regarding the current state of ischaemic stroke management in China. Notably, there is high use of traditional Chinese medicine and neuroprotectants and long lengths of hospital stay. Similar to many other countries, differences in stroke care and management by age and gender also exist to a small extent in China.

20637223|t|Baicalein is neuroprotective in rat MCAO model: role of 12/15-lipoxygenase, mitogen-activated protein kinase and cytosolic phospholipase A2.
20637223|a|Inflammatory damage and oxidative stress play an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment. Baicalein, isolated from the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Huangqin, is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent on one hand and a lipoxygenase inhibitor on the other hand. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of baicalein's neuroprotection in ischemic stroke. We therefore investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of baicalein and explored the underlying mechanisms. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and baicalein was administered intravenously immediately after cerebral ischemia. At 24h after MCAO neurological deficit, brain water content and infarct sizes were measured. Immunohistochemistry, western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to analyse the expression of 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) at gene and protein levels in ischemic brain cortex. The results showed that baicalein improved neurological deficit, reduced brain water content and infarct sizes, and downregulated the overexpression of 12/15-LOX, p38 MAPK and cPLA2 typically seen with MCAO. The results indicated that baicalein protected the brain from damage caused by MCAO, and this effect may be through downregulation of 12/15-LOX, p38 MAPK and cPLA2 expression.

20939990|t|[Effects of electro-acupuncture at Shuigou (DU26) point on motor evoked potential in rats with cerebral infarction].
20939990|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of electro-acupuncture at Shuigou (DU26) on latency and amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP) in rats after cerebral infarction. METHODS: Fifty healthy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups as normal group, untreated group, sham-operated group, non-acupoint group and Shuigou group, with 10 rats in each group. By using a modification of the technique of middle cerebral artery occlusion, focal cerebral ischemia injury was induced in rats except normal and sham-operated groups. Rats in the normal group received no treatment. Rats in the sham-operated group underwent identical experimental procedures as the other groups, except that the nylon suture was inserted into the internal carotid artery. After the behavioral deficit was evaluated by using Zausinger 6-point neurological function score, rats in the Shuigou group and non-acupoint group were separately acupunctured and stimulated by continuous-wave with 2 Hz frequency, 1 mA intensity, for 10 minutes, twice a day for 3 days. Non-acupoint was located at the left side 0.5 cm of the Shuigou point. No intervention was given to the other groups. Zausinger 6-point neurological function and MEP were measured after 72-hour treatment. RESULTS: The latency at the affected side in the untreated group was significantly longer than that in the normal group (P<0.05), and the amplitude at the affected side was significantly reduced (P<0.01). After 3-day electro-acupuncture, the latency at the affected side of rats in the Shuigou group was obviously shortened as compared with the untreated group (P<0.05), and the amplitude was significantly increased (P<0.05). The latency at the affected side in the Shuigou group was shorter than that in the non-acupoint group (P<0.05), and the amplitude tended to increase as compared with the non-acupoint group, but there were no significant differences (P>0.05). There were no significant differences on the latency and amplitude between the untreated group and non-acupoint group (P>0.05). The neurobehavioral score of the Shuigou group was significantly higher than those of the untreated group and non-acupoint group (P<0.05), and there were no significant differences between the untreated group and non-acupoint group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Electro-acupuncture at Shuigou can increase the latency and amplitude of MEP in rats after cerebral infarction.

20977842|t|[Effect of Buyang Huanwu decoction on interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α expression in rats after cerebral infarction].
20977842|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD) on pro-inflammatory cytokines in rats after focal cerebral infarction. METHODS: Adult Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into following groups: normal control, sham, model, BYHWD. The rats in latter three groups were subdivided into subgroups of 1, 3, and 7 days after medication, with 5 rats in each group. The right side focal cerebral infarction model was reproduced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The rats in BYHWD group were gavaged with BYHWD of 10 ml/kg (14.2 g/kg, once a day) 2 hours after operation. Animals were sacrificed at corresponding time points. The protein and mRNA expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: There were low levels expression of IL-1β and TNF-α protein and mRNA in normal control group and the sham group. After cerebral infarction, the protein and mRNA expression of IL-1β and TNF-α began to increase in rats 1 day after the insult, and the protein and mRNA expression of IL-1β reached the peak on 3rd day, and then lowered, and the protein and mRNA expression of TNF-α reached the peak on 7th day. Compared with model group on 1st, 3rd and 7th day, the protein expression of IL-1β (ng/L: 90.290±8.693 vs. 102.556±13.934 on 1st day, 129.632±11.050 vs. 150.117±8.552 on 3rd day, 66.185±9.020 vs. 91.362±9.901 on 7th day) and TNF-α (ng/L: 210.341±19.247 vs. 236.887±20.137 on 1st day, 267.503±21.006 vs. 322.659±15.068 on 3rd day, 299.637±17.717 vs. 386.678±16.297 on 7th day), and mRNA expression of IL-1β (1 day: 0.54±0.09 vs. 0.64±0.11, 3 days: 0.80±0.06 vs. 0.89±0.07, 7 days : 0.70±0.09 vs. 0.78±0.08) and TNF-α (1 day: 0.64±0.09 vs. 0.73±0.11, 3 days: 0.74±0.13 vs. 0.85±0.07 , 7 days : 0.82±0.07 vs. 0.93±0.08], were all decreased obviously in BYHWD group ( P<0.05 or P<0.01). CONCLUSION: BYHWD could reduce the protein and mRNA expressions of IL-1β and TNF-α in levels after cerebral infarction. The result shows that it protects brain by modulating expression of pro-inflammatory mediators.

20977840|t|[Effect of ultra-micronized Buyang Huanwu decoction on neurological function, quality of life, and serum vascular endothelial growth factor in patients convalescent from cerebral infarction].
20977840|a|OBJECTIVE: To study effect of Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD) on neurological function, quality of life, and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients convalescent from cerebral infarction, and to evaluate the effect of ultra-micronized BYHWD. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-one patients met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to traditional BYHWD (TB) group (n=83), ultra-micronized BYHWD (UB) group (n=85) and the control group (n=83) according to time of entrance into the study with 1:1:1. All patients received rehabilitation training, but for patients in the TB and UB groups, traditional BYHWD (15 g, twice a day) or ultra-micronized BYHWD (5 g, twice a day) was given respectively, for a course of 12 weeks. Clinical curative effect and curative effect of syndrome according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were evaluated. Nerve function and quality of life in patients were evaluated, serum VEGF was determined before and after treatment. The level of VEGF in 23 healthy volunteers was also determined to serve as normal control. RESULTS: The total effective rate was 83.5%, 85.5% and 77.1% in UB group, TB group and the control group, respectively, and the total symptomatic effective rate in TCM was 87.0%, 89.2% and 77.1%, respectively. Compared with the control group, there was significant difference in UB or TB group (all P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between UB and TB groups (both P >0.05). Serum VEGF levels (ng/L) were significantly lower before treatment in control group, TB group and UB group than those in normal control group (79.87±2.81, 80.19±3.23, 80.23±3.18 vs. 68.13±3.39, all P<0.05). Neurologic deficit score (NDS), quality of life and serum VEGF were improved after treatment in three groups, but they were better in UB or TB group than the control group [NDS: 11.95±5.03, 12.68±4.67 vs. 15.23±5.12, quality of life score: 64.71±6.73, 63.56±6.53 vs. 59.09±6.81, serum VEGF (ng/L): 76.38±3.02, 76.84±3.18 vs. 70.26±3.15 , all P<0.05], but there was no significant difference between UB and TB groups (all P >0.05). CONCLUSION: BYHWD can improve neurological function and quality of life, and increase serum VEGF in patients convalescent from cerebral infarction, and ultra-micronized BYHWD, the dosage can be decreased.

20093170|t|Comparative pharmacokinetics of baicalin in plasma after oral administration of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang or pure baicalin in MCAO and sham-operated rats.
20093170|a|A sensitive and specific HPLC method was developed to analyze baicalin in rat plasma. The author had compared the pharmacokinetics of baicalin after oral administration of HLJDT decoction or pure baicalin in MCAO and sham-operated rats. All the rats were divided into two groups, MCAO and sham-operated rats. Each group contained two subgroups: HLJDT decoction and pure baicalin subgroup. The HLJDT subgroup oral administration of HLJDT decoction extract 10.00 g/kg according to body weight (containing baicalin 400.00 mg/kg according to body weight), the pure baicalin subgroup received a gavages at a dosage of baicalin 400.00 mg/kg according to body weight too. The pharmacokinetics parameters were analyzed by kinetica. The results indicated that the pharmacokinetics of baicalin in rat plasma was non-linear and there were significant differences between different groups. No matter in MCAO or sham-operated rats, pure baicalin had shown better absorption than HLJDT decoction. Whether administration of pure baicalin or HLJDT decoction, the MCAO rats show better, quicker absorption of baicalin than sham-operated rats. It was good for baicalin to exert pharmacological effects on healed cerebrovascular diseases. The method had been applied successfully to pharmacokinetics of baicalin in rat plasma after oral administration of pure baicalin or HLJDT decoction.

21179740|t|[Dynamic physiologic and pathologic changes in brain of rat with middle cerebral artery obstruction and effects of acupuncture in different frequencies on them].
21179740|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the dynamic changes of capillaries and inflammatory cells in different regions of brain in rat with middle cerebral artery obstruction (MCAO), and the effects of acupuncture in different frequencies on them. METHODS: In reference to Zea-Longa's method, rat model of MCAO was established by thread-ligation. Shuigou point (DU26), the main acupoint for "awakening brain and opening apertures", was stimulated by high (180 times/s) or low (60 times/s) frequency puncturing 5 s every 12 h for 6 times totally. The amount of capillaries (AC) and inflammatory cells (AIC) in brain cortex (BC), hippocampus (Hp) and corpus striatum (CS) was counted. RESULTS: Changes in AC and AIC of all brain regions (except for CS) in rats immediately after modeling were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05). But 72 h later, AC in CS decreased, AC in Hp, AIC in BC and AIC in Hp increased significantly in the modeled rats, showing significant difference to the normal level, but AIC reduced to approach the normal. As compared with the rats un-intervened, AIC in BC and Hp was decreased in rats intervened with high frequency puncturing, AC and AIC in CS were increased in rats intervened by slow frequency puncturing (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Amount of capillaries and inflammation cells are changed dynamically in MCAO rats after brain ischemia, showing evident brain regional specificity; the ischemic improving effects of acupuncture in different frequencies are various in their action rings, also showing brain regional specificity.

21179728|t|[Relationship of Chinese medicine syndrome pattern with heart function and brain natriuretic peptide in patients with heart failure].
21179728|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the relationship of Chinese medicine (CM) syndrome pattern with heart function detected by ultrasonic cardiography and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level in patients with heart failure (HF). METHODS: One hundred and sixteen inpatients of HF hospitalized in Dongfang Hospital from January, 2007 to January, 2009 were assigned to three groups according to their CM syndrome pattern differentiated, the qi-yin deficiency group (QYD), the qi-deficiency and blood-stasis group (QDBS) and the yang-deficiency with water overflowing group (YDWO). Ultrasonic cardiographic (USCG) parameters, including left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVEDs), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were detected, and blood level of BNP was measured. RESULTS: LVEF was decreased while BNP was increased in patients with syndrome patterns in the order of QYD --> QDBS --> YDWO, and showed significant difference between groups (P < 0.01); CM syndrome patterns was related with all the USCG parameters and BNP level, especially the BNP (r = 0.71, P < 0.05) and LVEF (r = -0.34, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: LVEF and BNP can reflect the severity of heart failure, and they could be taken as the beneficial objective and quantitative indices for syndrome pattern differentiation.

21141505|t|[Effect of heart tablets on cardiac hemodynamics and myocardial oxygen consumption in anesthetized dogs].
21141505|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the pharmacological effects of Heart tablets on cardiac function and its mechanism, the effects on cardiac hemodynamics and myocardial oxygen consumption in anesthetized dogs were observed. METHOD: Observe the effect of Heart tablets on coronary blood flow, cardiac output, myocardial oxygen consumption and other indicators in normal anesthetized dogs. RESULT: The Heart tablets can increase femoral arterial blood pressure, while no effect is found on the heart rate, standard II ECG PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, T wave and other parameters. The tablets can expand coronary artery and peripheral vessel, increase coronary blood flow, lower coronary resistance and increase cardiac blood supply capacity, improve left ventricular function, ameliorate cardiovascular adaptability, increase dp/dt(max), enhance myocardial activity and have a positive regulatory role in heart. At the meantime raise the cardiac output and stroke volume were raised, so that blood pressure can be increased, while the total peripheral resistance was decreased. The coronary vein sinus oxygen content were significantly increased and myocardial oxygen consumption index and myocardial oxygen utilization were reduced. CONCLUSION: The tablets can adjust and improve the cardiovascular system.

20600767|t|Chinese medicine Nao-Shuan-Tong attenuates cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting apoptosis in a rat model of stroke.
20600767|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Nao-Shuan-Tong (NST) in capsule form is a compound prescription formulated according to the meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and is approved by the State Food and Drug Administration of China for the treatment of ischemic stroke. OBJECTIVES: To test the neuroprotective effects of the Chinese medicine Nao-Shuang-Tong on cerebral ischemia in rats and to explore the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 115 Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), and I/R plus NST 0.25, NST 0.5 and NST 1 (n=23 in each group). Cerebral ischemia was induced by 1.5h of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Cerebral infarct area was measured by tetrazolium staining at 24h following reperfusion, and neurological functional deficits were assessed at 1, 3, 7 and 14 d after reperfusion. Neuronal apoptosis was studied by Nissl staining and DNA fragmentation assay at 1 and 3d after reperfusion. The activation of caspase-3, -8, -9 and Bax/Bcl-2 levels were analyzed by western blot 24h after reperfusion. RESULTS: NST (0.5 and 1g/kg) significantly reduced cerebral infarct area, attenuated neurological functional deficits, and reduced neuronal apoptosis in ischemic cortex and in the CA1 region of hippocampus. NST also suppressed overexpression of Bax and activated caspases-3, -8 and -9, and also inhibited the reduction of Bcl-2 expression and markedly depressed the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that NST is neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia and is likely to act via inhibition of neuronal apoptosis associated with changes in levels of caspases-3 and -8, Bax and Bcl-2.

20576952|t|Minor allele C of chromosome 1p32 single nucleotide polymorphism rs11206510 confers risk of ischemic stroke in the Chinese Han population.
20576952|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Genome-wide association studies found that the common allele T of single nucleotide polymorphism rs11206510 on chromosome 1p32 was associated with increased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels (LDL-C) and with risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in white populations. The goals of this study are to determine whether rs11206510 is associated with LDL-C and CAD in a different ethnic population, namely a Chinese cohort, and to investigate whether rs11206510 is associated with ischemic stroke. METHODS: The association of rs11206510 with LDL-C was analyzed in 1415 Chinese Han subjects. The CAD study utilized a GeneID cohort with 1543 CAD patients and 1240 controls. For stroke studies, 2 independent cohorts were used and included the GeneID North cohort, with 1205 cases and 1205 controls, and the GeneID Central cohort, with 692 cases and 882 controls. RESULTS: Different from white populations, the minor allele C of rs11206510 was associated with increased LDL-C levels in the Chinese Han population (adjusted P=0.002) and conferred risk of early-onset CAD (380 cases vs 1240 controls; adjusted P=0.002, odds ratio, 1.89), but not with overall CAD (adjusted P=0.82). The allelic association with ischemic stroke was highly significant in 2 independent cohorts, with adjusted P=1.13x10(-5) (odds ratio,1.71) in the GeneID North cohort and adjusted P=9.32x10(-5) (odds ratio, 1.70) in the GeneID Central cohort. Genotypic association was also significant for both early-onset CAD and ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that single nucleotide polymorphism rs11206510 is associated with LDL-C levels and early-onset CAD in the Chinese Han population. For the first time to our knowledge, this study also demonstrates that rs11206510 confers a significant risk of ischemic stroke.

20673364|t|Contralateral acupuncture versus ipsilateral acupuncture in the rehabilitation of post-stroke hemiplegic patients: a systematic review.
20673364|a|BACKGROUND: Contralateral acupuncture (CAT) involves inserting needles in the meridian on the side opposite the disease location and is often used in post-stroke rehabilitation. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize and critically evaluate the evidence for and against the effectiveness of CAT for post-stroke rehabilitation as compared to ipsilateral acupuncture (IAT). METHODS: Seventeen databases were searched from their inceptions through June 2010. Prospective clinical trials were included if CAT was tested as the sole treatment or as an adjunct to other treatments for post-stroke rehabilitation and compared to IAT. RESULTS: Eight randomized clinical trials (RCTs) met our inclusion criteria. Four of them reported favorable effects of CAT compared to IAT for at least one outcome. A meta-analysis showed superior effects of CAT compared to IAT on recovery rate (n = 361; risk ratio (RR), 1.12; 95% confidence intervals (CIs), 1.04 to 1.22, P = 0.005). Subgroup analysis also showed favorable effects of using CAT on patients with cerebral infarction (n = 261; RR, 1.15; 95% CIs, 1.04 to 1.27, P = 0.006). Further analysis including patients with cerebral infarction and intracranial hemorrhage, however, failed to show these advantages (n = 100; RR, 1.11; 95% CIs, 0.85 to 1.46, P = 0.43). CONCLUSION: The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that there is limited evidence for CAT being superior to IAT in the treatment of cerebral infarction. The total number of RCTs included in our analysis was low, however, and the RCTs included had a high risk of bias. Future RCTs appear to be warranted.

20381504|t|Icariin protects against brain injury by enhancing SIRT1-dependent PGC-1alpha expression in experimental stroke.
20381504|a|Icariin (ICA) has neuroprotection in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) neurons by increasing Sirtuin1 (SIRT1). However, little is known about the role of ICA on stroke. SIRT1 is a class III histone deacetylase and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) which stimulates mitochondrial activity. This study aims to investigate the expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha during ICA's neuroprotection against ischemia. In vivo, behavioral test, infarct size and brain water content were evaluated on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse models treated by ICA/saline. In vitro, primary cortical neurons were tortured by OGD in the presence of ICA or SIRT1 inhibitor III or PGC-1alpha siRNA. Cell viability and mortality were measured by MTT and flow cytometer assay. Knockdown efficiency of PGC-1alpha siRNA was measured by real time PCR. Expressions of SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha were also investigated. In result, neurological scores, infarct size and brain edema were all significantly improved, the cortical expressions of SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha were higher with ICA compared to the control (P < 0.05), and reversed by SIRT1 inhibitor III/PGC-1alpha siRNA. In conclusion, ICA protects against brain ischemic injury by increasing the SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha expression, potentially to be a neuroprotectant for ischemic brain injury.

20064536|t|Neuroprotective and neuroproliferative activities of NeuroAid (MLC601, MLC901), a Chinese medicine, in vitro and in vivo.
20064536|a|Although stroke remains a leading cause of death and adult disability, numerous recent failures in clinical stroke trials have led to some pessimism in the field. Interestingly, NeuroAid (MLC601), a traditional medicine, particularly used in China, South East Asia and Middle East has been reported to have beneficial effects in patients, particularly in post-stroke complications. Here, we demonstrate in a rodent model of focal ischemia that NeuroAid II (MLC901) pre- and post-treatments up to 3 h after stroke improve survival, protect the brain from the ischemic injury and drastically decrease functional deficits. MLC601 and MLC901 also prevent neuronal death in an in vitro model of excitotoxicity using primary cultures of cortical neurons exposed to glutamate. In addition, MLC601/MLC901 treatments were shown to induce neurogenesis in rodent and human cells, promote cell proliferation as well as neurite outgrowth and stimulate the development of a dense axonal and dendritic network. MLC601 and MLC901 clearly represent a very interesting strategy for stroke treatment at different stages of the disease.

20602267|t|Effects of salvianolic acid B on proliferation, neurite outgrowth and differentiation of neural stem cells derived from the cerebral cortex of embryonic mice.
20602267|a|Salvianolic acid B is isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza, the root of which is widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine to treat stroke. However, little is known about how salvianolic acid B influences growth characteristics of neural stem cells (NSCs). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of salvianolic acid B on proliferation, neurite outgrowth and differentiation of NSCs derived from the cerebral cortex of embryonic mice using MTT, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. It was found that 20 microg mL(-1) and 40 microg mL(-1) salvianolic acid B had similar effects on proliferation of NSCs, and a suitable concentration of salvianolic acid B increased the number of NSCs and their derivative neurospheres. The growth-promoting activity of salvianolic acid B was dependent on and associated with an accumulation in the G2/S-phase cell population. Salvianolic acid B also promoted the neurite outgrowth of NSCs and their differentiation into neurons. The mRNA for tau, GFAP and nestin were present in differentiating neurospheres induced by salvianolic acid B. However, high-level expression of tau mRNA and low-level expression of GFAP mRNA was detected in differentiated cells, in contrast to the control conditions. This collective evidence indicates that exogenous salvianolic acid B is capable of promoting proliferation of neurospheres and differentiation towards the neuronal lineage in vitro and may act in the proliferation of NSCs and may promote NSC differentiation into neuronal cells.

20550873|t|[Impedance characteristics of ear acupoints in identifying excess or deficiency syndrome of stroke].
20550873|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the impedance characteristics of ear acupoints in stroke patients with excess or deficiency syndrome, and to provide basis data for objective study of the syndromes of stroke. METHODS: The data of electrical characteristics of ear acupoints in stroke patients and healthy people were collected, and excess syndrome and deficiency syndrome of stroke were identified by quantifying the syndromes of stroke using scales. The differences in impedance characteristics of ear acupoints between stroke patients and healthy people were analyzed, and the differences in impedance characteristics of ear acupoints between stroke patients with excess syndrome and stroke patients with deficiency syndrome were analyzed too. The correlation among impedance characteristics of ear acupoints, stroke and the syndromes was also analyzed. RESULTS: There were significant differences in impedance characteristics of ear acupoints between stroke patients and healthy people (P<0.05,P<0.01). The ear acupoints CO12 (Gan) and CO13 (Pi) had a significant role in diagnosing stroke as compared with CO18 (Neifenmi), AT3.4.AH12i (Naogan), CO10 (Shen), TG2p (Shenshangxian), AH6a (Jiaogan), AT4 (Pizhixia), and CO15 (Xin). There were significant differences in impedance characteristics of ear acupoints between stroke patients with excess syndrome and stroke patients with deficiency syndrome (P<0.05, P<0.01). The ear acupoints AH6a (Jiaogan) and CO10 (Shen) played an important role in differentiation diagnosis of excess syndrome and deficiency syndrome of stroke, followed by CO18 (Neifenmi), TF4 (Shenmen) and TG2p (Shenshangxian). CONCLUSION: Some ear acupoints with diagnostic value for stroke may provide basis of objective research for stroke diagnosis as well as identifying excess syndrome and deficiency syndrome of stroke.

20353383|t|Ginsenoside Rbeta1 reduces neurologic damage, is anti-apoptotic, and down-regulates p53 and BAX in subarachnoid hemorrhage.
20353383|a|Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and the number one cause of adult disability in the United States and Europe. A subtype of stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), accounts for 7% of all strokes each year and claims one of the highest mortalities and morbidities. Many therapeutic interventions have been used to treat brain injury following SAH but none have reached the level of effectiveness needed to clinically reduce mortality. Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1), a major component of the Chinese traditional medicine Panax Ginseng, has been shown to reduce ischemic brain injury and myocardial injury via anti-apoptotic pathways. In the present study, we investigated the use of GRb1 on SAH induced brain injury in rats. Four groups were used: sham, vehicle (SAH), low dose treatment (SAH+ 5mg/kg GRb1), and high dose treatment (SAH+ 20mg/kg GRb1). Post assessment included wall thickness and mean cross-section area of basilar artery were measured for evaluating cerebral vasospasm, Evans blue extravasations to assess blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, immunohistochemistry and Western Blot analysis looking for specific pro-apoptotic markers, and tunnel staining for cell death assessment. In addition, mortality, neurological function and brain edema were investigated. The results showed that high dose GRb1 treatment significantly enlarged mean cross-sectional area and decreased wall thickness of basilar artery, reduced neurological deficits, brain edema, BBB disruption, and TUNEL positive cell expression. Same time, we found that the proteins expression of P53, Bax and Caspase-3 were significantly reduced, whereas the expression of bcl-2 was up-regulated in Rb1 treatment. The results of this study suggest that GRb1 could relieve cerebral vasospasm and potentially provide neuroprotection in SAH victims. The underlying mechanisms may be partly related to inhibition of P53 and Bax dependent proapoptosis pathway. More studies will be needed to confirm these results and determine its potential as a long term agent.

20031334|t|Can traditional "cupping" treatment cause a stroke?
20031334|a|The case study of a patient who developed haemorrhagic stroke after 'cupping' to the cervical area is presented. We consider the various manners in which cupping might induce haemorrhagic or ischemic stroke with particular reference to the relevant pathologies of the major cervical arteries. The other possible causes due to the induced cupping stresses are also examined using a computer based simulation study. Cupping of the cervical area may cause a haemorrhagic stroke by an acute rise in blood pressure. The tensile radial stresses generated by cupping may potentially facilitate the development of a dissection in the presence of an intimal tear. Moreover, the possible presence of micro-inclusions can intensify the local stress concentration for a thin cap.

20456840|t|Characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine syndromes in post-stroke depression.
20456840|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the main characteristics of syndromes in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in post-stroke depression (PSD) and to provide basis for treatments with TCM herbs. METHODS: According to diagnostic criteria of PSD, stroke patients and depression patients from Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital, Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were assigned into cerebral stroke group (150 cases), depression group (151 cases) and PSD group (123 cases). Neuropsychological assessments and imaging and biochemical analyses were conducted. TCM syndrome differentiation for these diseases was performed. We also determined the characteristics of TCM syndromes of PSD, relative risk of the syndromes and their correlations with ages as well. RESULTS: Scores of qi stagnation and blood stasis, liver qi depression, and transformation of fire due to qi stagnation in PSD group were significant higher than those in cerebral stroke group (P<0.05, P<0.01). In cerebral stroke group, majority of the patients displayed one syndrome, while in PSD and depression groups, the patients had three or more syndromes. Of these syndromes, the incidence rate of syndrome of liver qi depression complicated with transformation of fire due to qi stagnation or flaring of fire due to yin deficiency was high. The syndrome of liver qi depression occurred much more frequently in PSD group and depression group than in cerebral stroke group (P<0.05, P<0.01). The logistic regression analysis showed that the syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis had high relative risk to PSD. The syndrome of deficiency of heart and spleen was positively correlated with age in cerebral stroke group. CONCLUSION: The main TCM syndromes of PSD and depression are qi stagnation and blood stasis, liver qi depression, and transformation of fire due to qi stagnation. The syndrome of deficiency of heart and spleen is closely related to age among the stroke patients. The syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis serves as an independent risk factor for PSD. The more complicated the syndromes are, the more serious depression becomes.

20456839|t|Outcome and safety assessment of an herbal medicine treatment protocol for yin pattern of acute ischemic stroke.
20456839|a|BACKGROUND: The morbidity of stroke is high. Traditional Chinese medicine is commonly used for patients with ischemic stroke in China, but the efficacy need be further proved. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of an herbal medicine treatment regimen integrating traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine for ischemic stroke patients with yin pattern syndrome. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: A multicenter, randomized and controlled clinical trial was adopted. A total of 537 patients with acute ischemic stroke were enrolled in 22 hospitals from July 2005 to October 2006, among whom 274 were assigned to group A (herbal group) and administered with Western medicine plus herbal medicine treatment, and the other 263 in group B (control group) with Western medicine plus placebo. The patients in two groups were all treated for 21 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint of outcome measures was Barthel index. The secondary endpoints included National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the modified Rankin criteria, Stroke Specific Quality of Life, and Stroke Scale of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The adverse effects of the treatment were also observed. RESULTS: A total of 622 randomization numbers were applied by the centers and 16 numbers were lost for mishandling, so a total of 606 patients were included. Fifteen patients were excluded (5 in group A, and 10 in group B), and 54 (25 in group A, and 29 in group B) lost in follow-up. A total of 537 patients completed the trial and a per-protocol set analysis was conducted. There were no statistical differences in age, sex, pulse rate, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, medical history, neurological deficit scores, scores on Glasgow Coma Scale, and lesion size of intracerebral ischemia between the two groups at baseline (P>0.05). Twelve patients, including 5 in group A and 7 in group B, died during the 90 days of research period, and no significant difference was found between the two groups. Compared with Western medicine alone, herbal medicine treatment could improve the neurological deficit at day 21, activities of daily living at day 90 of follow-up, and the patient-reported outcome at days 21, 60, and 90 (P<0.05). Independent living ability of the patients was also improved (67.9% of group A vs 59.3% of group B, 0-1 at modified Rankin criteria). Moreover, the herbal medicine treatment showed a tendency in improving quality of life at a time-dependent manner. Adverse events, including gastrointestinal adverse events, skin symptoms, hemorrhagic tendency, and aminotransferase increase, happened in 76 cases from both groups, and no significant difference was found between the two groups. Correlation analysis showed that aminotransferase increase was not related to the herbal medicine treatment, but to the lipid-lowering drugs. CONCLUSION: The present research demonstrates that the herbal medicine treatment shows effects on neurological deficit and patient-reported outcome at day 21, activities of daily living and handicap at day 60, and handicap, activities of daily living and patient-reported outcome at 3-month follow-up.

20386768|a|Since 2006, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society heart failure (HF) guidelines have published annual focused updates for cardiovascular care providers. The 2010 Canadian Cardiovascular Society HF guidelines update focuses on an increasing issue in the western world - HF in ethnic minorities - and in an uncommon but important setting - the pregnant patient. Additionally, due to increasing attention recently given to the assessment of how care is delivered and measured, two critically important topics - disease management programs in HF and quality assurance - have been included. Both of these topics were written from a clinical perspective. It is hoped that the present update will become a useful tool for health care providers and planners in the ongoing evolution of care for HF patients in Canada.

19940231|t|Pharmacokinetics and safety of ginsenoside Rd following a single or multiple intravenous dose in healthy Chinese volunteers.
19940231|a|The pharmacokinetics and safety of ginsenoside Rd (Rd) were assessed in healthy Chinese volunteers. In the single-dose study, a randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover design was used. Participants were assigned to receive 10, 45, or 75 mg Rd by intravenous infusion, with a 2-week washout period between dosing periods. Plasma levels of Rd were found to be proportional to dose, with the mean C(max) and AUC(0-infinity) ranging from 2.8 to 19.3 mg/L and 27.9 to 212.5 mg x h/L over the dose range studied. Ginsenoside Rd was slowly cleared from plasma (t(1/2Z) = 17.7-19.3 hours). In the multiple-dose study, 10 mg Rd was administered once daily for 6 days. Slight drug accumulation was noted. The mean steady-state C(max), AUC(0-infinity), and AUC(ss) were 4.0 mg/L, 51.7 mg x h/L, and 26.4 mg x h/L, respectively. The t(1/2Z) was 20.5 hours, which was similar to the single-dose value. Ginsenoside Rd was well tolerated with no pattern of dose-related adverse events. It had a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile that enables the drug to be explored in future clinical studies that target patients with acute ischemic stroke.

19800960|t|Neuroprotective effects of xiao-xu-ming decoction against ischemic neuronal injury in vivo and in vitro.
19800960|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiao-Xu-Ming decoction (XXMD) has long been employed clinically to treat stroke in traditional Chinese Medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the neuroprotective effects of XXMD in vivo and in vitro stroke models and determine involved mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two models (four-vessel occlusion in adult Wistar rats and oxygen-glucose deprivation primary cultured neurons) were employed to mimic ischemia-reperfusion damage, in vivo and in vitro, respectively. The effects of XXMD were investigated with respect to neuronal damage, activity of caspase-3 and expression of Bcl-2 in CA1 region of hippocampus after ischemia. The cognitive ability was measured 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion by using Morris water maze. RESULTS: Oral administration of XXMD significantly increased the density of neurons that survived in the CA1 region of hippocampus on the 3rd and 7th day after transient global ischemia was induced in a dose-dependent manner. XXMD ameliorated severe deficiencies in spatial cognitive performance induced by transient global ischemia. Inhibition of caspase-3 activity and up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression were induced in the high dose of XXMD-treated rats after ischemia. In oxygen-glucose deprivation model, both XXMD extract and drug-containing serum prepared from blood of high dose of XXMD-treated rats inhibited apoptotic neuronal death at 24h after reoxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly demonstrated that XXMD is neuroprotective and appears to influence deleterious pathological processes that are activated after the onset of ischemia.

20578645|t|The effects of electro-acupuncturing DU26 (renzhong) on motor cortical excitability and neurofunction after focal cerebral ischemia injury in rats.
20578645|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) on cortical excitability and neurofunction after focal cerebral ischemia injury. METHOD: 30 male Wistar rats were divided randomly into control group, MCAo group and MCAo+DU26ES group, 10 in each group. Middle Cerebral Artery occlusion models (MCAo) were created in accordance with Zea Longa method and modified method. DC continuous square-wave electric pulse stimuli (2Hz, 3mA) which was given between DU26 and non-acupoint area in the left shoulder, was applied to MCAo+DU26ES group 10 minutes every time, twice a day, while the control group and MCAo group received no treatment. 3 days later transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potential (MEP) was recorded, the onset latency and peak-to-peak amplitude were analyzed and the neurological deficits were evaluated. The effects of electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) and MCAo injury on these parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Given the isointensity suprathreshold stimulus, the latency on the affected side in MCAo group was significantly longer than that in control group (P<0.05), the amplitudes on both sides were significantly reduced (P<0.05, P<0.05); the latencies on both sides in MCAo+DU26ES group tended to become shorter and the amplitudes on both sides tended to increase compared with MCAo group; there were no significant differences on latency and amplitude between the healthy side and the affected side in all groups (P>0.05). The neuro-scores of rats receiving electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) were significantly higher than those in MCAo group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) can improve the motor cortical excitability, and facilitate the motor function recovery after MCAo injury.

21364615|t|Baifuzi reduces transient ischemic brain damage through an interaction with the STREX domain of BKCa channels.
21364615|a|Stroke is a long-term disability and one of the leading causes of death. However, no successful therapeutic intervention is available for the majority of stroke patients. In this study, we explored a traditional Chinese medicine Baifuzi (Typhonium giganteum Engl.). We show, at first, that the ethanol extract of Baifuzi exerts neuroprotective effects against brain damage induced by transient global or focal cerebral ischemia in rats and mice. Second, the extract activated large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (BK(Ca)) channels, and BK(Ca) channel blockade suppressed the neuroprotection of the extract, suggesting that the BK(Ca) is the molecular target of Baifuzi. Third, Baifuzi cerebroside (Baifuzi-CB), purified from its ethanol extract, activated BK(Ca) channels in a manner similar to that of the extract. Fourth, the stress axis hormone-regulated exon (STREX) domain of the BK(Ca) channel directly interacted with Baifuzi-CB, and its deletion suppressed channel activation by Baifuzi-CB. These results indicate that Baifuzi-CB activated the BK(Ca) channel through its direct interaction with the STREX domain of the channel and suggests that Baifuzi-CB merits exploration as a potential therapeutic agent for treating brain ischemia.

20395679|t|Safety profile of MLC601 (Neuroaid) in acute ischemic stroke patients: A Singaporean substudy of the Chinese medicine neuroaid efficacy on stroke recovery study.
20395679|a|BACKGROUND: Previous clinical trials have shown that Neuroaid (MLC601), a traditional Chinese medicine, shows good tolerability and superiority over another traditional Chinese medicine in terms of neurological disability and functional outcome and thus may be beneficial as part of a poststroke rehabilitation program. The safety of MLC601 on hemostasis, hematology and biochemistry has been established in normal subjects and patients with nonacute stroke over a short treatment period. We assessed the safety of Neuroaid in patients with acute stroke treated for 3 months in a substudy of an ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Laboratory tests (biochemical, hematological and electrocardiogram) were conducted at the month 3 follow-up, in addition to baseline tests. A total of 114 patients were recruited. As there were 13 dropouts, a total of 52 patients on MLC601 and 49 on placebo were available for analysis. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were also analyzed. RESULTS: There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between treatment groups in biochemical, hematological or electrocardiogram tests at month 3, nor any statistically or clinically significant differences in the absolute and relative changes of the various parameters between baseline and 3 months. SAEs were similar and were those commonly seen in stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Longer-term laboratory safety data show no differences between MLC601 and placebo, confirming the safety of MLC601 in acute stroke patients receiving a 3-month treatment.

20098017|t|Efficacy of keishibukuryogan, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, in treating cold sensation and numbness after stroke: clinical improvement and skin temperature normalization in 22 stroke patients.
20098017|a|Cold sensation and numbness have been reported as post-stroke sensory sequelae attributable to distal axonopathy, which is caused by chronic ischemia of diseased limbs resulting from dysfunction of vasomotor regulatory systems. Keishibukuryogan is a traditional herbal medicine used to treat symptoms of peripheral ischemia such as cold extremities. This study investigated clinical improvement and skin temperature in peripheral ischemia patients to determine the efficacy of keishibukuryogan in alleviating post-stroke cold sensation and numbness. Twenty-two stroke patients with cold sensation and/or numbness were enrolled in this study. Subjective cold sensation and numbness, evaluated using the visual analogue scale, were found in 21 and 31 limbs, respectively. The skin temperature of diseased and healthy limbs was recorded. We observed all patients for 4 weeks and 17 patients for 8 weeks after administration of keishibukuryogan. The skin temperature of diseased limbs was significantly higher than baseline at 4 weeks and 8 weeks, whereas that of healthy limbs did not change significantly. Cold sensation and numbness were significantly improved at 4 weeks and 8 weeks compared to baseline. Keishibukuryogan administration resulted in warming of diseased limbs and improved cold sensation and numbness, probably by increasing peripheral blood flow.

19910543|t|Confirmation of genomewide association signals in Chinese Han population reveals risk loci for ischemic stroke.
19910543|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The first genomewide association study of ischemic stroke in whites has identified multiple susceptibility loci. We confirmed this study by examining associations with ischemic stroke in a Chinese Han population. METHODS: Twenty-five common variants were genotyped in a relatively large sample size including 1123 subjects with ischemic stroke cases (thrombosis stroke=716, lacunar infarction=407) and 557 normal control subjects. The association analyses were performed at both single nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype levels. False discovery rate q value method was applied for multiple testing corrections. RESULTS: rs11052413, a intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism, was most significantly associated with ischemic stroke independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in additive (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.19 to 1.92, P=7.4 x 10(-4), q=0.018) and dominant models (OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.20 to 2.08, P=9.2 x 10(-4), q=0.023). In addition, both ZNF650 rs10204475 and intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism rs10486776 were associated with ischemic stroke as well as independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in dominant models (OR=1.47, 95% CI=1.12 to 1.96, P=0.005, q=0.040 and OR=1.53, 95% CI=1.15 to 2.02, P=0.003, q=0.036, respectively). No significant results were found in stroke subtype analysis after multiple corrections. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed previously reported associations between ischemic stroke and rs11052413, rs10486776, and ZNF 650 rs10204475 in a Chinese Han population. The mechanism whereby the genetic variants exert their effects on ischemic stroke remains to be further elucidated.

19954337|t|Short-term reactions to acupuncture treatment and adverse events following acupuncture: a cross-sectional survey of patient reports in Korea.
19954337|a|OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the type and frequency of short-term reactions, de qi associated with acupuncture treatment, and to determine the incidence of adverse events following acupuncture treatment in Korea. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective and cross-sectional survey of patient reports using 1095 subjects; 585 subjects are outpatients of the East-West NEO Medical Center and the remaining 510 subjects are outpatients of the Kyung Hee Medical Center. In the period of June to November 2006, the participating subjects, who had all received acupuncture, consented and completed a single survey form. On this form, patients were asked to report their short-term reactions to the acupuncture, de qi, a patient satisfaction score (using the Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]) and any adverse events related to the acupuncture treatment. The 8 acupuncturists involved in this study were Korean medicine doctors who had more than 10 years' experience working as practitioners. RESULTS: The average age of the 1095 subjects was 58 years old. Positive short-term acupuncture reactions were reported by 878 (80.2%) of the 1095 subjects. Seventy-five (75) (6.8%) subjects described negative short-term acupuncture reactions. The most common positive short-term acupuncture reaction was that of a "relaxed" feeling in 472 (43.1%), followed by 90 (8.2%) who acknowledged a feeling of "less pain"; 16 (1.5%) felt "energized"; 16 (1.5%) experienced "tingling" and a sensation of "Heat" or "Coldness" was reported by 10 (0.9%). Negative short-term acupuncture reactions included feelings of "pain" 37 (3.4%), tiredness 24 (2.2%), and dizziness 9 (0.8%). Traditionally, the needling sensations of de qi refer to a patient's response to treatment, such as distension, pulling, soreness, heaviness, and numbness. Some (39.7%) subjects reported de qi during needling. A number experienced "distension" 333 (30.4%), "soreness" 52(4.7%), "pulling" 22(2.0%), "heaviness" 18(1.6%), and "numbness" 10 (0.9%). Positive short-term acupuncture reactions and de qi ratings were highest in those less than 40 years of age (83/96 86.5%, 50/96 52.1%). No reaction responses to acupuncture were the highest frequency in subjects over 70 years of age (31/187, 16.6%). Patient satisfaction level using VAS was comparatively high: 72.9 +/- 19.9. The only adverse events reported were bleeding in 92 (8.4%) of the participants. The majority of patients treated with acupuncture had suffered from stroke (430; 16.9%), headache (185; 16.9%), hypertension (97; 8.9%), or dizziness (85; 7.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term acupuncture reactions and de qi were related to the age group. With the exception of bleeding, there were no adverse events related to the acupuncture treatment in this study. We consider acupuncture treatment to be very safe if the practitioners are well educated, trained and experienced. The number of post-treatment positive short-term acupuncture reactions was 12 times higher than that of the negative short-term reactions. Overall, subjects were comparatively satisfied with the acupuncture treatment.

The Karnofsky Performance Status scores of heart function were increased and the Activity of Daily Living scores in living capacity decreased in both groups, but the improvements were better in the treatment group (P<0.01 and P<0.05). The parameters of cardiac function, including cardiac output, stroke volume, cardiac index and ejection fraction, were increased in both groups, but the increments in the treatment group were more significant (P<0.01 or P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Long-term application of SMC could effectively prevent and treat angina pectoris, improve the living capacity and accelerate the recovery of heart function in patients after myocardial infarction.

19679847|t|Multi-ethnic genetic association study of carotid intima-media thickness using a targeted cardiovascular SNP microarray.
19679847|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identification of subclinical atherosclerosis by ultrasonographic measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is a validated tool, in conjunction with traditional risk factors, for clinical assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. IMT has also been recognized as a quantitative measure of cardiovascular disease progression in asymptomatic individuals, and many candidate gene association studies have attempted to identify genetic variants associated with interindividual differences in IMT with limited success. We sought to test the association between subclinical atherosclerosis measured by IMT and approximately 50,000 SNPs, densely mapping approximately 2100 genes found on the gene-centric Illumina cardiovascular disease beadchip in a multi-ethnic population-based sample. METHODS: IMT was measured by B-mode ultrasound and DNA was collected from a population-based sample of South Asian (n=328), Chinese (n=302), and European Caucasian (n=268) participants. Genetic association was measured using multivariate linear regression including adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: The most robust association across all models tested was observed for a SNP (rs3791398) in histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4; P=1.8e-5 to P=3.6e-5), while another strong association signal was observed with natriuretic peptide receptor a/guanylate cyclase A (NPR1) (rs10082235, P=5.4e-5). Seven of 13 previously reported functional candidate genes contained a SNP that was marginally associated (0.01 < P < or = 0.05). CONCLUSION: This initial multi-ethnic high-density association study of carotid IMT suggests some novel loci requiring further evaluation in follow-up studies.

20031605|t|9p21 is a shared susceptibility locus strongly for coronary artery disease and weakly for ischemic stroke in Chinese Han population.
20031605|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies on genome-wide association have identified common variants on chromosome 9p21 associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Given that ischemic stroke and CAD share several aspects of etiology and pathogenesis, we investigated the association of variants on chromosome 9p21 with ischemic stroke and CAD in the Chinese Han population by capturing the majority of diversity in this locus using haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a shared control-cases study using 15 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 2 previously reported susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms spanning 58 kb of the chromosome of 9p21 in a set of 558 patients with ischemic stroke, 510 patients with CAD, and 557 unaffected participants (controls) in the Chinese Han population. The association analyses were performed at both SNP and haplotype levels. We further verified our findings in an independent cohort of 442 ischemic stroke cases and 502 control subjects. In the first study, rs2383206, rs1004638, and rs10757278 in block 3 were significantly associated with CAD but not with ischemic stroke independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in additive model (P = 0.002 to 0.0001, q = 0.026 to 0.004). Analysis from all blocks revealed that haplotype profiles of block 3 on 9p21 were significantly different between shared control and cases of CAD (P = 1.3 x 10(-10), q = 1.2 x 10(-9)) and ischemic stroke (P = 1.7 x 10(-6), q = 7.7 x 10(-6)). In the expanded second case-control study, block 3 on 9p21 remained associated with ischemic stroke (P = 2.6 x 10(-4), q = 6.3 x 10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest for the first time that 9p21 is a shared susceptibility locus, strongly for CAD and weakly for ischemic stroke, in a Chinese Han population.

19583646|t|Effects of Meridian acupressure for stroke patients in Korea.
19583646|a|AIM: To examine the effects of Meridian acupressure on the functions of affected upper extremities, activity of daily living and depression for stroke patients. BACKGROUND: The handicaps of stroke patients necessitate multidisciplinary rehabilitation, which is aimed at decreasing the consequences of the illness in daily functions. In traditional Chinese medicine, Meridian acupressure has been used for rehabilitation of affected upper extremities of hemiplegia stroke patients in clinical practice. DESIGN: Randomised clinical trial. METHOD: Sample was 56 consecutive stroke patients in K Oriental hospital. Meridian acupressure was applied every day for 10 min per time in the experimental group (28 subjects) for two weeks. Routine care only was applied in the control group (28 subjects). Measures were a hand dynamometer for grip power, a 15-point graphic rating scale for pain, the distance round the index finger for oedema, electrogoniometry for the passive ROM of the upper extremities, the activity of daily living scale for activity of daily living and the six-face rating scale for depression. Data were collected from March 2003-September 2004. RESULTS: There were significant differences in functions of affected upper extremities, activity of daily living and depression between experimental and control group. CONCLUSIONS: Meridian acupressure was an effective intervention for improving the movement of the affected upper extremities, increasing activity of daily living and decreasing depression of hemiplegia stroke patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Health professionals need to consider an array of methods including Meridian acupressure for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. Meridian acupressure has the potential as an alternative nursing intervention for multidisciplinary rehabilitation of stroke patients in practice.

19556527|t|Complex traditional Chinese medicine for poststroke motor dysfunction: a systematic review.
19556527|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For its current dimensions, stroke represents the world's primary health challenge. In China stroke is the second most common cause of death. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has for many centuries been used, and it is still widely used today in countries of south and east Asia for the treatment of people with stroke. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate whether complex Traditional Chinese Medicine (cTCM) improves poststroke motor recovery. In particular, we defined cTCM as intervention that included at least acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. METHODS: An extensive search including PubMed, EMBASE, CBM, and the Cochrane Library was performed up to December 2007. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) about cTCM for motor dysfunction of poststroke were searched irrespective of any language. The quality of each trial was assessed according to the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook 4.2.6. RESULTS: After selection of 11 234 articles, 34 RCTs and quasi-RCTs were included. All these trials were conducted in China and published on Chinese journals. All trials but one reported results in favor of cTCM treatments suggesting a strong publication bias. Because of the significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was performed and thus no cumulative result was obtained pooling data of RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: What appears from this systematic review is that scant data are available to evaluate efficacy of cTCM for poststroke motor dysfunction. Most of the primary studies available for this review were inadequately designed trials characterized by unknown dropout rates and definitional vagueness in outcomes measures. None of the studies approached important end points like death, survival times, rate of dependency, reduction in length of stay in hospital, etc. The key to lead to evidence-based practices is establishing a consensus on standardized relevant outcome measures and then designing and conducting appropriate RCTs that adopt those standards.

19671417|t|[Effects of scalp acupuncture on acute cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats].
19671417|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanisms of scalp acupuncture in treating cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: Sixty SD rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were randomly divided into untreated group and scalp acupuncture group. The scalp acupuncture was performed by inserting needles from Baihui (GV20) to Qubin (GB7), and the scalp was stabbed through 0.5 to 0.8 cun with a 30 degree angle. After a Han's Electro-Acupuncture Apparatus was connected, we selected "disperse-dense" wave and alternated frequency of 2 Hz and 100 Hz at an intensity level of 2 mA, 30 min once daily. Another 10 SD rats without artery occlusion were taken as sham-operated control. Neurological severity score (NSS), hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were applied to observing the changes of neurofunctional defect, the inflammatory infiltration in cerebral tissue and the contents of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in brain tissues after 24-, 48- and 72-hour reperfusion. RESULTS: There were significant differences in NSS between the scalp acupuncture group and the untreated group (P<0.05, P<0.01) after 24-, 48- and 72-hour reperfusion, especially after 72-hour reperfusion. HE staining results of ischemic cerebral tissues showed an apparent reduction of inflamed lesions in the scalp acupuncture group as compared with the untreated group, especially after 72-hour reperfusion. The contents of COX-2 and NF-kappaB after reperfusion in the scalp acupuncture group were significantly lower than those in the untreated group in 24, 48 and 72 h (P<0.01, P<0.05), and the contents of TGF-beta1 in scalp acupuncture group were significantly higher than those in the untreated group after 24-, 48- and 72-hour reperfusion (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture can attenuate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, improve neurofunctional rehabilitation and suppress leukocyte infiltration in rats by decreasing the contents of COX-2 and NF-kappaB and enhancing TGF-beta1 expression in brain tissues.

19671416|t|[Effects of Chinese medicine for regulating "sea of blood in brain" combined with bone marrow stromal stem cell transplantation on angiogenesis in ischemic brain tissue of rats].
19671416|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe whether Naomai Yihao (NM) Capsule, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine for regulating the "sea of blood in brain", and bone marrow stromal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation could improve angiogenesis in focal cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established. The rats were divided into untreated group, NM group, BMSC group and combination of NM and BMSC group (combined treatment group). Another 8 normal rats were selected as sham-operated group. After 3-, 7- and 14-day reperfusion, behavioral rating scale (BRS) of the rats and histopathology of the cerebral tissue were evaluated. Expression of CD31 in the brain tissue was also measured by immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: Compared with the untreated group, BRSs of the NM group, BMSC group and combined treatment group were decreased significantly (P=0.000), but there was no interacting effect between NM and BMSC transplantation. Compared with the untreated group, the numbers of CD31 positive cells in NM group, BMSC group and combined treatment group were increased significantly (P=0.000), and there were interacting effects among NM, BMSC transplantation, and the observation time (P<0.01). After 14-day reperfusion, combination of NM and BMSC transplantation could largely increase the number of CD31 positive cells. CONCLUSION: NM is able to promote the angiogenesis and neurological impairment improvement in focal cerebral ischemia of rats which are administered with BMSC transplantation, and the effect is reinforced with the extension of treatment time.

19527825|t|Safflower extracts functionally regulate monoamine transporters.
19527825|a|Safflower (HH), the dry flower of Carthamus tinctorius L., has long been used to empirically treat neuropsychological disorders such as stroke and major depression in traditional Chinese medicine, and recently been proven effective for regulating levels of dopamine and serotonin in new-born rat brain. The present study assessed whether HH would be bioactive for functionally regulating monoamine transporters using in vitro drug-screening cell lines. Our current results showed that all solvent-extracted HH fractions, in different degrees, markedly increased both dopamine uptake by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine uptake by CHO cells expressing norepinephrine transporter (NET), and also showed that chloroform (HC), ethyl acetate (HE), and n-butyl alcohol extract strikingly depressed serotonin uptake by CHO cells expressing serotonin transporter (SERT); wherein, the potencies of ethanol extract, HC, HE, and aqueous extract to up-regulate dopamine/norepinephrine uptake and potency of HE to inhibit serotonin uptake were relatively stronger. Further investigation revealed that the enhancement of dopamine/norepinephrine uptake by HC and HE was dependent of DAT/NET activity, and the HE-induced inhibition of serotonin uptake was typical of competition. Thus, HH extracts are novel monoamine transporter modulators functioning as DAT/NET activators and/or SERT inhibitors, and would likely improve neuropsychological disorders through regulating monoamine-transporter activity.

19527824|t|Chinese medicine tongxinluo significantly lowers serum lipid levels and stabilizes vulnerable plaques in a rabbit model.
19527824|a|RELEVANCE TO ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY: Tongxinluo capsule is a compound preparation formulated on the basis of the meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine and is officially approved for the treatment of angina pectoris and ischemic stroke in China.OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that the Chinese traditional medicine tongxinluo in capsule form has similar effects as simvastatin in lowering serum lipid levels and stabilizing vulnerable plaques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty New Zealand white rabbits underwent balloon-induced abdominal aortic endothelial injury and were fed a diet of 1% cholesterol for 8 weeks. The rabbits were then randomly divided into three groups (n=10 each) for daily doses of tongxinluo capsule (1 g/kg), simvastatin (5 mg/kg) or no drugs for 12 weeks. At the end of week 20, plaque rupture was induced by pharmacological triggering. Serological, ultrasonographic, pathologic, immunohistochemical, and gene expression studies were performed. RESULTS: The incidence of plaque rupture with tongxinluo and simvastatin treatment was significantly lower than that with control treatment (0% for both drug treatments vs. 56.0%; P<0.05). Values of serum lipid profile, inflammatory markers, and pathological and immunohistological assays were significantly improved in the tongxinluo- and simvastatin-treated groups than in the control group. The simvastatin-treated group showed lower serum lipid levels than the tongxinluo-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the Chinese medicine tongxinluo was as effective as simvastatin in lowering serum lipid levels, inhibiting plaque inflammation and preventing vulnerable plaques from rupture and may provide an alternative therapy for atherosclerosis.

19428793|t|Baicalin administration is effective in positive regulation of twenty-four ischemia/reperfusion-related proteins identified by a proteomic study.
19428793|a|Baicalin is a major plant polyphenolic compound derived from the dried root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, a Traditional Chinese Medicine material. The current study applied proteomics to investigate the different protein expression modes in mice brains after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with or without administration of baicalin. Twenty-four proteins which had a 3-fold change in abundance compared to the sham control sample were selected to be identified. Statistical analysis demonstrated that there was no significant difference in expression between the twenty-four proteins baicalin-treated MCAO group and the sham-operation group (n=24, p=0.102). Gene Ontology analysis linked these proteins to fifteen biological processes, including cellular process, developmental process and biological regulation. Results indicated that baicalin performed well in regulating proteins in energy metabolism but had a relatively weak effect in the regulation of proteins in neurogenesis and apoptosis. In sum, our findings suggest baicalin may be a potential therapeutic agent in treating stroke and may also be a strong candidate for future research in its actions on individual proteins.

19615312|t|[Considerations about treatment programs of elderly patients with hypertension].
19615312|a|Hypertension in elderly patients is a common and frequent disease which could cause stroke, heart failure and renal dysfunction. The pathogenesis of hypertension in the elderly is different from that in the young and middle-aged people, and its clinical characteristics including frequent isolated systolic hypertension, variable blood pressure, high pulse pressure, multiple complications, serious target organ damage, and so on. High prevalence, disability and mortality rates and low awareness, treatment and control rates are prominent phenomena in the elderly patients with hypertension, bringing many difficulties for clinical treatment. Presently, drug therapies for elderly patients mainly include Western medicine (WM), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine. WM therapy has superiority in lowering blood pressure intensively with clear mechanism, but has more adverse reactions. The effects of TCM therapy are multilinked, and TCM is good at reducing side effects and improving symptoms, but TCM preparation falls behind and its hypotensive effects are weak and slow. Furthermore, more multicenter, randomized, controlled and double-blinded clinical trials with large sample are needed to identify the effects of TCM therapy. Based on combination of TCM syndrome differentiation and WM disease differentiation, treatment programs of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine would take advantages of both TCM and WM treatment modalities, and are worthy of being studied in the future.

19489489|t|[Observation on therapeutic effect of acupuncture on stroke by "Najia method of Ziwu Liuzhu"].
19489489|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of acupuncture treatment on stroke according to the acupoint selection of "Najia method of Ziwua Liuzhu" and to investigate the mechanism. METHODS: One hundred and ninety cases were randomly divided into a Ziwu Liuzhu group (n=95) and a routine acupuncture group (n=95). Five shu points on different meridians were selected according to the Tiangan (Heavenly Stems)-tables of "Najia method of Ziwu Liuzhu" in the Ziwu Liuzhu group, and the treatment was carried out within the period from Chen (7:00-9:00 AM) to Si (9:00-11:00 AM). In the routine acupuncture group, Fengchi (GB 20), Shuigou (GV 26), Waiguan (TE 5), etc. were selected to treat the patients immediately on first visit. The therapeutic effects of two groups were assessed by the scores of neural functial cinl deficiency, status of total living ability, blood rheological indexes and clinical comprehensive effectiveness. RESULTS: The total effective rate of 95.8% in the Ziwu Liuzhu group was significantly better than 80.0% in the routine acupuncture group. The scores of neural functional deficiency, main items of blood rheology and total living ability in the Ziwu Liuzhu group were significantly lower than those in the routine acupuncture group (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture treatment in the period from Chen to Si according to the acupoint selection of "Najia method of Ziwu Liuzhu" has a significant clinical effectiveness which is related with improvement of the indexes of blood rheology.

19930923|t|[Evolution of the concept of wind stroke of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)].
19930923|a|The wind stroke is a common syndrome in clinical disease; the physicians of past generations accumulated much experience in long-term clinical practice and left abundant literature. Looking from this literature, the physicians of past generations had different cognitions of the wind stroke, especially the concept of wind stroke. The connotation of wind stroke differed at different stages, going through a gradually changing process from exogenous disease, true wind stroke, apoplectic wind stroke to cerebral apoplexy.

19361363|t|[Dynamic changes in traditional Chinese medicine syndromes in patients with ischemic stroke treated by acupuncture].
19361363|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the dynamic state of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes in acute ischemic stroke patients within 30 days of onset when treated with acupuncture, and to analyze the discrimination effects of the functions based on "decision trees" in identification of TCM syndromes of ischemic stroke. METHODS: A total of 264 cases with acute ischemic stroke regularly treated by acupuncture were included. Unified syndrome questionnaire was made by document retrieval and expert advice. The syndrome elements of the patients with acute ischemic stroke were surveyed on any day of three time periods (days 0-3, 4-10 and 11-30). The study was performed on multi time dynamic state results and correlated factors of basic TCM syndromes of the 264 patients. Bayes discriminant function of four syndromes of acute ischemic stroke on the basis of "decision trees" was used for computing the rate of miscarriage justice by original test and cross-validation, and the discrimination effects of "decision trees" were evaluated too. RESULTS: Wind, phlegm, fire-heat, qi deficiency, blood stasis, and hyperactivity of yang due to yin deficiency syndromes were found in the patients with acute ischemic stroke treated by acupuncture on the first 30 days of onset, and the incidence rates were 80.7%, 68.9%, 52.7%, 50.8%, 29.2% and 25.0% respectively. The mean scores and incidence rates of the six syndromes decreased gradually on three-time-point, especially of blood stasis syndrome. The main combined-syndromes were two-syndrome, three-syndrome and four-syndrome, and three-syndrome was the most frequently encountered type. Single syndrome was not found in the patients with acute ischemic stroke on the first three days of onset. Two-syndrome combination types were wind-phlegm, wind-heat, wind combined with qi deficiency or phlegm stagnation due to qi deficiency, phlegm-heat and blood stasis combined with hyperactivity of yang due to yin deficiency, and the incidence rates were 54.5%, 42.8%, 40.9%, 39.4%, 35.6% and 3.8% respectively. The mean scores of phlegm and qi deficiency in high-age patients were higher than those in low-age patients. The mean score and incidence rate of qi deficiency in female patients were higher than those in male patients. The mean score of phlegm in female patients was higher than that in male patients. To simplify the "decision trees" composed of 21 items, the group of Bayes discriminant function including eight most significant items out of the original 21 items was set up. The discrimination effect of the eight items including reddish face, constipation, yellow tongue fur, short breath, bright-white or gray complexion, tinnitus, feverish palms and soles and scanty tongue fur was similar to that of the 21 items, and there was no significant difference between the two functions. CONCLUSION: Wind syndrome and phlegm syndrome are the major single syndromes occurring in acute ischemic stroke patients within 30 days of onset, and three-syndrome combination is the most frequent multiple syndrome type. After acupuncture treatment, some syndrome elements including wind, phlegm, fire-heat, qi deficiency, blood stasis, and hyperactivity of yang due to yin deficiency are gradually reduced, and combined syndrome type is gradually become simple. Eight syndrome element items including reddish face, constipation, yellow tongue fur, short breath, bright-white or gray complexion, tinnitus, feverish palms and soles and scanty tongue fur have important means in discriminating yin syndrome from yang syndrome and sthenia syndrome from asthenia syndrome.

19526762|t|[Establishment of rat model of ischemic stroke with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome and its evaluation system].
19526762|a|OBJECTIVE: To probe into the establishing method and the evaluating system for rat model of ischemic stroke with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome (QDBS). METHODS: A rat model of ischemic stroke of QDBS was established by continual exhaustive swimming followed with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and evaluated by analyzing the changes of exterior signs, tongue figure, hemorrheologic characters and brain histomorphology in the model rats. RESULTS: The model rats showed a state of QDBS in the course of continual exhaustive swimming, such as slower weight gain, postponed food intake, darker tongue and longer sublingual veins; and presented the characteristics of cerebral ischemia with QDBS syndrome after MCAO, they were inactive, weak, and hemiplegic, with dark purple tongue and longer blue sublingual veins. Moreover, hemorrheologic examinations showed blood hyperviscosity and high platelet aggregation rate, and histomorphologic examinations showed a special figure of ischemic changes. CONCLUSION: Continual exhausting swimming followed by MCAO is a method for establishing a rat model of ischemic stroke with QDBS syndrome, and its evaluating system could be constituted by multiple criteria, including exterior signs, tongue figure, hemorrheologic and histomorphologic indexes, etc.

19526752|t|[Effect of Chinese herbal medicine for benefiting qi and nourishing yin to promote blood circulation on ventricular wall motion of AMI patients after revascularization].
19526752|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Chinese herbal medicine for benefiting qi and nourishing yin to promote the blood circulation (abbr. as CHM) in promoting ventricular wall motion and myocardial contraction in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after revascularization. METHODS: Subjects were 80 AMI patients after revascularization, of those, the 40 patients in the TCM group were treated with Xinyue Capsule and compound Tanshinon Tablet upon the basic conventional Western medical treatment and the other 40 in the control group were given conventional Western medicine alone, the course for them all was 3 months. Cardiac function indexes, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), wall motion indices, normal myocardial percentage (NMP), longitudinal systolic peak strain (LSPS) and rate (LSPSR), were observed by Doppler ultrasound under dobutamine stress at the 14 days after revascularization and the end of 3-month treatment. RESULTS: Except the 5 cases (3 in the TCM group and 2 in the control group) dropped out in the observation period, the trial was completed in 75 patients totally. LVEF, NMP, minus LSPS of left ventricular anterior apex and inferior basement, minus LSPSR of anterior apex, middle, basement, and minus LSPSR of inferior middle, basement were more significantly increased in Chinese medicinal treatment group than those in the control group at 14-day after revascularization (P < 0.01). The treatment group, minus LSPS and minus LSPSR of the left ventricular anterior apex and the inferior basement were at markedly higher levels compared with the controls at 3-month after revascularization (P < 0.05). Minus LSPSR of the left ventricular anterior apex and the inferior basement in the treatment group at 3-month was higher than that at 14-day after revascularization (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CHM combining with conventional Western medicine treatment could improve the left ventricular contractive function and wall motion in AMI patients after revascularization.

19270391|t|Proteomics profiling of pituitary, adrenal gland, and splenic lymphocytes in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion.
19270391|a|Ischemic strokes are often accompanied by serious brain injury and poor prognosis, but the molecular mechanisms of primary and secondary injury have not been fully understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protein profile in the rat pituitary, adrenal gland, and splenic lymphocyte using proteomics techniques, and to elucidate potential changes in the immune neuroendocrine system following cerebral ischemia injury in rats. Out of the 41 differentially expressed protein spots identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS-TOF), 13 proteins were closely related to the immune and/or the neuroendocrine system, and the other proteins might have different functions through other mechanisms in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. The results showed that (i) the immune neuroendocrine system was obviously changed, and the changes might be important pathological mechanisms in brain injury after cerebral ischemia, and (ii) ischemic brain damage is co-regulated by several mechanisms. The results might lay the foundations for further research on pathological mechanisms in cerebral ischemia.

19262552|t|C-reactive protein polymorphisms and genetic susceptibility to ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke in the Chinese Han population.
19262552|a|AIM: The inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) has been strongly correlated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported to be associated with serum CRP levels. In this study, we assessed the genetic association between SNPs within the CRP gene and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in the Han Chinese population. METHODS: This study comprises 564 ischemic stroke patients, 220 hemorrhagic stroke patients and 564 controls from the ethnic Han Chinese population in Wuhan. Four CRP SNPs, -757A>G (rs3093059), -717A>G (rs2794521), -286C>T>A (rs3091244) and +2147C>T (rs1205), were genotyped from patients using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: The A allele frequency for the -717A>G polymorphism was significant higher in controls than in ischemic stroke patients (P=0.037), after adjustment for traditional risk factors (odds ratio 0.28; 95% CI 0.12-0.65; P=0.003), suggesting a protective effect for this allele against ischemic stroke. Haplotype analysis showed that the H3 (G-C-C) haplotype conferred a significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio 1.052, 95% CI 1.001-1.106: P=0.047). Neither CRP genotypes nor haplotypes showed an association with hemorrhagic stroke. However, the frequency for haplotype H5 (A-T-C) was significantly higher in ischemic stroke than hemorrhagic stroke patients (P=0.0003). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the CRP gene -717A allele confers a protective effect against ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the H3 haplotype (G-C-C) is an independent risk marker for ischemic stroke, whereas the H5 haplotype (A-T-C) can be used as a prognostic marker of hemorrhagic stroke.

19304519|t|[Effect and safety of the therapies for acute myocardial infarction patients with failed thrombolytic therapy: a systematic review].
19304519|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect and safety of therapies in common use for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with failed thrombolytic therapy. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (1984 to July 2006), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, 1994 to July 2006), China Biomedicine Database disc (CBMdisc, 1980 to July 2006). We also searched several key Chinese journals in the field of cardiovascular diseases. The language was limited to Chinese and English. We included all the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for acute myocardial infarction patients with failed thrombolytic therapy. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies, the data were analyzed by RevMan 4.2.8 from the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS: Nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria. A significant difference was found between the rescue percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) group and conventional treatment group in the mortality rate at the end of the follow-up [RR=0.64, 95%CI (0.41, 0.98)]. Thromboembolic stroke and bleeding in rescue PCI group were significantly higher than that in conventional treatment group [RR=4.39, 95%CI (1.14, 16.87), and RR=2.79, 95%CI (1.55, 5.02), respectively]. Compared with conventional therapy, rescue thrombolytic treatment was associated with a significantly higher reperfusion rate [RR=2.92, 95%CI (1.75, 4.85)]. Comparison between rescue PCI with rescue thrombolytic treatment revealed that the revascularization rate in rescue PCI group was significantly lower than that in rescue thrombolytic group [RR=0.57, 95%CI (0.34, 0.95)], and the incidence of bleeding was significantly higher in rescue PCI group [RR=2.15, 95%CI (1.27, 3.63)]. Comparison of glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists with standard treatment showed no significant difference between them in the mortality rate and bleeding rate at the end of the follow-up. CONCLUSION: Current evidence does not confirm the effect or safety of the therapies for AMI patients with failed thrombolytic therapy, nor support the routine use of these therapies in clinical practice except for rescue PCI that reduces mortality compared with traditional treatment. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to provide reliable evidence for the treatments of AMI patients with failed thrombolytic therapy.

19164787|t|Danqi Piantang Jiaonang (DJ), a traditional Chinese medicine, in poststroke recovery.
19164787|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Despite improvements in acute stroke treatment, many patients only make a partial or poor recovery. Therefore, there is a need for treatments that would further improve outcome. Danqi Piantang Jiaonang (DJ; NeuroAid), a traditional Chinese medicine widely used in China to improve recovery after stroke, has been compared with another traditional Chinese medicine in 2 unpublished randomized clinical trials. The results of these studies were pooled and reanalyzed to assess efficacy and safety. METHODS: Six hundred five subjects were randomized in 2 randomized double-blinded, controlled trials to receive either DJ or Buchang Naoxintong Jiaonang. Subjects were treated for 1 month. Inclusion criteria were: (1) patients with recent (from 10 days to 6 months) ischemic stroke; (2) patients satisfying Western diagnostic standards for stroke and traditional Chinese medicine standards for diagnosis of apoplexy; and (3) Diagnostic Therapeutic Effects of Apoplexy score >/=10. RESULTS: The functional outcome, measured by the Comprehensive Function Score component of the Diagnostic Therapeutic Effects of Apoplexy scale, showed a statistically significant superiority of DJ over the control treatment group (relative risk, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.28 to 4.51; P=0.007). Tolerance was excellent in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled analysis of 2 unpublished trials of DJ, a traditional Chinese medicine currently approved in China to improve neurological recovery after stroke, shows good tolerability and superiority of DJ over another traditional Chinese medicine also approved for stroke. A large double-blind randomized clinical trial is required to further assess the safety and efficacy of DJ.

19548433|t|[Analysis on somnipathy related factors in elderly patients with stroke and comparative study on the efficacy of treatment by traditional Chinese medicine and by estazolam].
19548433|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the somnipathy related factors in elderly patients with stroke and to compare effects of traditional Chinese medicine and estazolam on sleep and the followed nervous function. METHODS: The somnipathy related factors in 336 elderly patients with stroke, 221 accompanied with somnipathy and 115 with normal sleep, were studied and analyzed. Moreover, the 221 patients with somnipathy were assigned to two groups, 112 in the treated group treated with TCM according to syndrome differentiation, and 109 in the control group treated with estazolam. Changes of scores rated by neurological deficit scale (NDS), sleep dysfunction rating scale (SDRS), Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA), Hamilton depression scale (HAMD), and treatment emergent symptom scale (TESS) were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: The occurrence of somnipathy in patients with cerebral hemorrhage was significantly higher than in those with cerebral infarction; it was higher in patients with lesion in brain stem, cerebral hemisphere (frontal lobe), or basal ganglion than in those with lesion in other sites; and patients with severe neurological deficit were more liable to having somnipathy. TCM showed a significant effect in improving the insomnia symptoms in patients, with the total effective rate reaching 81.25% (91/112), which was higher than that in the control group, 65.14% (71/109, P < 0.01). Along with the improving of sleep, marked recovery of the nervous function was shown in both groups, with NDS score reduced significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of somnipathy in stroke patients was closely related with the property and site of lesion, and the neurological deficit degree of patients. Better sleep is surely favorable for recovery of the nervous function, and TCM shows a favorable efficacy on somnipathy.

19236501|t|A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study to investigate CHInese Medicine Neuroaid Efficacy on Stroke recovery (CHIMES Study).
19236501|a|Rationale Traditional Chinese Medications(TCM) have been reported to have beneficial effects in stroke patients, but were not rigorously evaluated by GCP standards. Aim This study tests the hypothesis that Neuroaid, a TCM widely used in China post-stroke, is superior to placebo in reducing neurological deficit and improving functional outcome in patients with acute cerebral infarction of an intermediate severity. Design This is a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Neuroaid in ischemic stroke patients with National Institute of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) 6-14 treated within 48 h of stroke onset. Neuroaid or placebo is taken (4 capsules) 3 times daily for 3 months. Treatments are assigned using block randomization, stratified for centers, via a central web-randomization system. With a power of 90% and two-sided test of 5% type I error, a sample size is 874. Allowing for a drop-out rate of up to 20%, 1100 individuals should be enrolled in this study. Study Outcomes The primary efficacy endpoint is the modified Rankin Scale(mRS) grades at 3 months. Secondary efficacy endpoints are the NIHSS score at 3 months; difference of NIHSS scores between baseline and 10 days, and between baseline and 3 months; difference of NIHSS sub-scores between baseline and 10 days, and between baseline and 3 months; mRS at 10 days, 1 month, and 3 months; Barthel index at 3 months; Mini Mental State Examination at 10 days and 3 months. Safety outcomes include complete blood count, renal and liver panels, and electrocardiogram.STUDY REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00554723.

19059471|t|Total saponins of Panax notoginseng modulate the expression of caspases and attenuate apoptosis in rats following focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
19059471|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Total saponins of Panax notoginseng (TSPN), main constituents extracted from Panax Notoginseng, a highly valued traditional Chinese medicine, have been shown to be an effective agent on cerebral infarction. AIM OF THE STUDY: The effects of TSPN on apoptosis and expressions of caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 were studied after cerebral ischemia for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 46 h in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model using the intraluminal thread. TSPN was administered intraperitoneally at 5 min before and 12 h, 24 h and 36 h after MCAO, respectively. RESULTS: TSPN (at the dose of 25 mg/kg) significantly attenuated TUNEL-positive cells and reduced the expression of caspase-1 and caspase-3 compared to the model group, while it had no obvious effect on the expression of caspase-8. CONCLUSIONS: The neuroprotective effect of TSPN on focal ischemia may be related to inhibition of apoptosis and caspases activation.

18973910|t|Effect of acupuncture treatment on spastic states of stroke patients.
18973910|a|PURPOSES: The control of spasticity is often a significant problem in the management of patients with stroke. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acupuncture treatment on the spastic states of stroke patients. SETTING: An outpatient Acupuncture Department in the First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and thirty-one patients, mean (SD) age of 59 (12) years, with spastic hemiplegia were included at mean (SD) month of 17 (7) months after stroke. INTERVENTION: Participants received two 30-day treatment regimens: combined stimulating surface projection zone of decussation of pyramid and traditional acupuncture treatment, and traditional acupuncture treatment only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in the modified Ashworth scale (MAS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Barthel Index (BI), and the electromyographic activity of the affected extremity between arms. RESULTS: The average (+/-SD) upper extremity Ashworth score significantly decreased, from 3.08+/-0.77 before treatment to 1.82+/-0.65 after acupuncture intervention (wrist joint, P<0.05), and from 2.72+/-0.59 to 1.32+/-0.71 (elbow joint, P<0.05) for treatment group. There were significant differences noted between the treatment group and control group after administration. Lower extremity treatment responses were similar to upper extremity responses. However, both groups showed similar improvement in FMA (upper extremity) and FMA (lower extremity). However, the improvements of FMA (total), BI, and F/M ratio were better in treatment group than in control group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that acupuncturing surface projection zone of decussation of pyramid was effective in reducing spastically increased muscle tone and motor neuron excitability in spastic hemiplegia, and could improve spastic states of stroke patients, thus providing a safe and economical method for treating stroke patients.

18938189|t|Acupuncture protected cerebral multi-infarction rats from memory impairment by regulating the expression of apoptosis related genes Bcl-2 and Bax in hippocampus.
18938189|a|Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia in the world today. In this paper, we observed the effect of acupuncture on memory impairment, apoptosis and expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in hippocampus of cerebral multi-infarction rats. The results indicated that acupuncture significantly improved memory impairment induced by cerebral multi-infarction, as evaluated by shortened escape latency and increased swimming time in the target quadrant. Meanwhile, based on the observation in hippocampal CA1 region through methods of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end labeling (TUNEL), immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, acupuncture decreased the number of apoptotic cells and expression of the proapoptotic Bax gene, on the contrary, it increased expression of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2. The result of the research suggested that acupuncture can exert antiapoptotic effect through counter-regulating Bcl-2 and Bax gene expression.

19711771|t|Methodological standards for experimental research on stroke using scalp acupuncture.
19711771|a|Scalp acupuncture (SA) is a modality based on different physiologic functions of different brain areas, using needles to stimulate different scalp zones so as to excite the reflex-related nervous tissue. The findings of several studies showed that the clinical effect of SA on stroke was significant, but the exact mechanism is still unclear. In this research, some new ways of thinking and new methodological standards on stroke experiment using SA are put forward. They are as follows: A, establishment of standard animal model of stroke; B, simulation of head acupoint line on animal model following traditional Chinese medicine localization; C, acupuncture manipulation and quantity of stimulus for SA in animal model; D, optimal curative opportunity and instant effect of SA therapy on stroke; E, mechanism study of SA on stroke. This research may provide methodological reference for future mechanism study on stroke experiment using SA.

19606509|t|Acupuncture stimulation improves balance function in stroke patients: a single-blinded controlled, randomized study.
19606509|a|The disturbance of balance function is one of main etiology resulting in falling down in stroke patients. A number of studies report that acupuncture may improve the motor function of stroke patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of acupuncture on balance function. We designed a single-blinded, controlled, randomized study. A total of 30 stroke patients were randomized into experimental and control groups. Experimental groups received acupuncture treatment accompanied by the manual twisting of needles and obtaining of qi (the subjects experienced sensations of soreness, numbness, swelling and heaviness, while the acupuncturist experienced a sensation of needle resistance), whereas the control group did not receive manual twisting of needles and without obtaining of qi. All of the subjects were first-time stroke patients; infarction location was limited to either the left or right hemisphere, and all subjects were able to walk for at least 6 meters. Acupuncture stimulation (AS) was applied to Baihui (GV 20) acupoint as well as to 4 spirit acupoints (1.5 cun anterior, posterior, left and right laterals from Baihui acupoint, respectively) for 20 min. Balance function outcome measures were: (1) the displacement area of the patient's center of gravity; (2) the time taken for a patient to stand vertically from a seated position; (3) the time taken for a patient to walk a distance of 6 meters; (4) muscle strength of both lower extremities. Results indicated that the displacement area from the center of gravity decreased in the experimental group, but not in the control group. There was greater reduction in the displacement area in the experimental group than in the control group. Following AS, the time taken to reach a standing position from a seated position, as well as the time taken to walk 6 meters was decreased equally in both the experimental and control groups. The muscle strength of the hip flexor and knee extensor were increased in the paralyzed and non-paralyzed sides of patients in the experimental group, but not in the control group. The results of the present study suggest that acupuncture stimulation may induce an immediate effect that improves balance function in stroke patients.

19183878|t|The inhibitory effects of cholalic acid and hyodeoxycholalic acid on the expression of TNFalpha and IL-1beta after cerebral ischemia in rats.
19183878|a|Previous studies have shown that Qing Kai Ling, a traditional Chinese medicine, was able to effectively prevent the inflammation from cerebral ischemia (Chen et al., 2002). The cholalic acid and hyodeoxycholalic acid (cholalic acid mixture) was major active components in Qing Kai Ling. To study the effects of cholalic acid mixture on the damage cascade of cerebral ischemia, rat model of focal cerebral ischemia was established by permanent occlusion of left middle cerebral artery. We found that the administration of cholalic acid mixture could reduce the ischemic infarct size after 24 h of ischemia, and cholalic acid mixture could be detected in cerebrospinal fluid after 2h of administration. We also found that the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interlukin-1beta in rat brain were significantly lower when compared to the untreated animals after 12 h and 24 h of ischemia. The concentrations of von Willebrand factor and neuron specific enolase in the plasma were remarkably decreased in cholalic acid mixture treated animals than in the untreated ones after 12h of ischemia. Our results suggested that cholalic acid mixture is able to decrease the expression of inflammation factors including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interlukin-1beta after focal cerebral ischemia.

19816018|t|A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II pilot study to investigate the potential efficacy of the traditional chinese medicine Neuroaid (MLC 601) in enhancing recovery after stroke (TIERS).
19816018|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous clinical studies have shown that Neuroaid (MLC 601) may be beneficial in post-stroke rehabilitation. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of Neuroaid on motor recovery in ischemic stroke patients using rehabilitation endpoints in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice guidelines, in order to provide predictive information for further larger trials. METHODS: This is a phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of 40 subjects admitted with a recent (less than 1 month) ischemic stroke. All subjects were given either Neuroaid or placebo, 4 capsules 3 times a day for 4 weeks. Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Functional Independence Measure scores were measured at initiation of the treatment, and at 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: None of the outcomes was statistically significant between the two groups. However, FMA scores showed a positive trend for improvement with Neuroaid treatment over time. Subgroup analysis of subjects with posterior circulation infarction and severe stroke both showed a tendency for better recovery. CONCLUSION: Some positive trends were observed in the Neuroaid group. A larger multicenter trial focusing on severe stroke patients is needed to better evaluate the role of Neuroaid in aiding stroke recovery in rehabilitation.

18599245|t|Alkaloid profiling of crude and processed Veratrum nigrum L. through simultaneous determination of ten steroidal alkaloids by HPLC-ELSD.
18599245|a|Veratrum nigrum L., a traditional Chinese herb, has been used for treatment of hypertension, blood-stroke, excessive phlegm, epilepsy, etc. Steroidal alkaloids were well-known as both bioactive and toxic constituents of Veratrum species, the toxicity of which the traditional processing procedure can reduce. To reveal the mechanism of processing V. nigrum L., a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) method was developed for the simultaneous determination of ten steroidal alkaloids in crude and processed V. nigrum L., comparison with ultrasound extract of crude V. nigrum L. With a Venusil XBP-C(18) analytical column, the analytes were separated efficiently using the mobile phase consisted of (A) 0.03% aqueous triethylamine (TEA) and (B) acetonitrile in a gradient program. The parameters for ELSD were set: S.C. (Spray Chamber)=35 degrees C, D.T. (Drift Tube)=70 degrees C, GAS=50 psi. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (gamma>or=0.9990) within the tested range. Additionally, reproducibility for the quantification of ten alkaloids in V. nigrum L. with intra- and inter-day variations of less than 5.0% was observed. The obtained alkaloid profiles performed by this newly established method, provided valuable information for the differentiation of crude and processed V. nigrum L. and for the explanation of the different toxicity.

18843664|t|Tongxinluo capsule for acute stroke.
18843664|a|BACKGROUND: Tongxinluo capsules are a compound of Chinese traditional medicine which contain substances that are thought to have vasodilatory, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, thrombolytic and even lipid-lowering properties, and therefore may improve outcome after acute ischaemic stroke. To date the evidence of its effect has not been systematically reviewed, making it difficult to derive robust conclusions about its actual benefits, and indeed, possible harms. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and possible harms of tongxinluo capsule for acute cerebral infarction compared with control. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched on 24 January 2008) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2007), MEDLINE (1995 to 2006), EMBASE (1995 to 2006), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, 1994 to 2006), CBM (Chinese Biomedical Database) (1995 to 2006), Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), National Research Register (http://www.update-software.com/national/). We handsearched 30 journals (1995 to 2006), and contacted drug companies and the principal of included trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing tongxinluo with placebo or open control (or tongxinluo plus standard therapy versus standard therapy alone) in people with definite acute stroke. We excluded trials if they sought to recruit patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), intracerebral haemorrhage, heart failure, or renal failure. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality. MAIN RESULTS: Only two poor quality studies with a total of 232 participants were included in this review. Neither study reported any of our pre-specified outcomes, so no reliable estimate of the effect of treatment on major clinical outcomes could be obtained. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It was not possible to reliably determine whether tongxinluo has a favourable or unfavourable effect in acute ischaemic stroke. High quality trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of tongxinluo capsule for acute ischaemic stroke.

19024435|t|[Feature selection based on correlation degree and its application in traditional Chinese medicine].
19024435|a|Mutual information can measure arbitrary statistical dependencies. It has been applied to many kinds of fields widely. But when mutual information is used as the correlation measure, the features with more values are apt to be chosen. To solve this problem, a novel definition of correlation degree is proposed in this paper. It can avoid the shortcoming of selecting more value features when mutual information acted as the measure, and it can avoid the shortcoming of selecting less value features when correlation degree coefficients acted as the measure. In the method using the novel definition, the number of selected features is determined by the correct classification rate of Support Vector Machine. At last, the efficiency of the method is illustrated through analyzing the symptoms combination of seven essential elements of the syndrome corresponding to stroke.

18822975|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of acupoint electrogymnastics therapy on apoplectic hemiplegia, so as to further popularize this therapy in treatment of apoplectic hemiplegia. METHODS: Using three-central, randomized, controlled, multi-blind methods, 153 cases were divided into an electrogymnastics group (n = 77) and an electroacupuncture group (n = 76). They were treated with acupoint electrogymnastics (AE) and traditional electroacupuncture (TEA), respectively. Shousanli (LI 10) and Waiguan (TE 5) on upper limbs and Yanglingquan (GB 34) and Zusanli (ST 36) on the lower limbs were selected in the two groups. A JD-2008 hemiplegia treatment apparatus was used in the AE group. Fugl-Meyer method was used for assessment of motor function and sense function of the four limbs, balance function and joint activity, etc. before and after treatment. RESULTS: In the motor function and sense function of four limbs, balance function and joint activity in the two groups had significant improvement after treatment (both P < 0. 001) with no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both acupoint electrogymnastics (AE) and traditional electroacupuncture (TEA) have a similar therapeutic effect on apoplectic hemiplegia, but AE has the advantages of safety, reliability and convenience in operation, so it is suitable for long-term rehabilitation treatment of the patient and for popularization in hospital of basic level.

18664349|t|[Effects of rhubarb aglycone on matrix metalloproteinase in cerebral ischemic tissue in rats with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation].
18664349|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of rhubarb aglycone on pathological changes and activity of matrix metalloproteinase in cerebral ischemic tissue in rats with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation, and to explore the action mechanisms of rhubarb aglycone in protecting against brain micrangium injury in rats. METHODS: The BMSCs were purified and amplified by methods of adherence and selection in vitro. One hundred and ninety rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group, untreated group, rhubarb aglycone group, BMSC transplantation group (abbreviated as transplantation group) and BMSCs combined with rhubarb aglycone group (abbreviated as combination group). Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was duplicated with nylon thread. Rats of transplantation and combination group were transplanted with BMSCs via carotid artery after 24-hour reperfusion. Rhubarb aglycone was used by intragastric administration in the rhubarb aglycone group and the combination group. The brain samples were taken at 7, 14 and 28 days after transplantation. Brain micrangium pathological changes were observed by light microscope, and immunohistochemical method was used to determine the expressions of immunoglobulin G (IgG), type IV collagen (Col IV), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). RESULTS: Comparison with the normal control group revealed that brain micrangium in rats in the untreated group was obviously mutilated and damaged, the expression of IgG and MMP-9 increased, and showed a progressively enhanced tendency following the prolongation of reperfusion, while the expressions of Col IV and TIMP-1 were decreased, and TIMP-1 showed a attenuated tendency following the prolongation of reperfusion. Comparing with the untreated group, the improvements of brain micrangium structure in the rhubarb aglycone group (7 days after transplantation), the transplantation group (14 and 28 days after transplantation) and the combination group were significant; expression of IgG and activity of MMP-9 were decreased, while expressions of Col IV and TIMP-1 were increased in the rhubarb aglycone group and the combination group at each time point. The brain micrangium was integral and the expression of Col IV was enhanced in combination group (7 days after transplantation) as compared with those in transplantation group. MMP-9 activity in combination group (14 days after transplantation) was lower than that in the rhubarb aglycone group (14 days after transplantation), while expression of TIMP-1 in combination group also increased significantly as compared with that in transplantation group (28 days after transplantation). CONCLUSION: Rhubarb aglycone can decrease the degradation of basal lamina Col IV and the permeability of brain micrangium in cerebral ischemic rats with BMSC transplantation, and its mechanisms may be related to regulating the balance of MMP-9, especially by increasing the expression of TIMP-1.

18664348|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of scalp-acupuncture on intelligence in patients with vascular dementia (VaD). METHODS: A total of 108 VaD patients were randomly divided into two groups: scalp-acupuncture group and Western medicine group. The scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Blesse Dementia Scale (BDS), Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS), Abilities of Daily Life (ADL) before and after treatment in the two groups were detected. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients completed the treatment. The scores of MMSE, BDS and HDS in the two groups were significantly increased, and the ADL scores significantly declined (P<0.05). There was no difference in the scores of MMSE, BDS, HDS and ADL between the two groups before and after the treatment. There was no difference in the total effectiveness between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Scalp-acupuncture therapy could improve the clinical intelligence level of VaD patients.

18646136|t|Acupuncture for dysphagia in acute stroke.
18646136|a|BACKGROUND: Dysphagia after acute stroke is associated with poor prognosis, particularly if prolonged. Acupuncture has been widely used for this complication in China. However, its therapeutic effect is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine the therapeutic effect of acupuncture for dysphagia after acute stroke compared with placebo, sham or no acupuncture intervention. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched September 2007), the Chinese Stroke Trials Register and the Trials Register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field (last searched January 2007) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007). In January 2007 we searched the following databases from the first available date; MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, CISCOM, BIOSIS Previews, ProQuest Digital Dissertations, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ACUBRIEFS, ACP Journal Club, Books@Ovid and Journals@Ovid, Chinese Biological Medicine Database, Chinese scientific periodical database of VIP INFORMATION, China periodical in China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Database, Science China, Chinese Social Science Citation Index, and the Chinese Science and Technology Document Databases. We also searched databases of ongoing trials, conference proceedings, and grey literature, handsearched three Chinese journals and contacted authors and researchers. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all truly randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effect of acupuncture, irrespective of type, in patients with dysphagia within 30 day after the onset of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. All types of acupuncture interventions were eligible. The control intervention could be placebo acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or no acupuncture. The primary outcome was recovery of normal feeding. The secondary outcomes were case fatality, deterioration, late disability, length of hospital stay, quality of life, feeding tube removal, aspiration pneumonia and nutritional measures. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by a third review author. MAIN RESULTS: Only one trial of 66 participants was included. In the acupuncture group, 12 out of 34 participants recovered to normal feeding (35.3%). In the control group, seven out of 32 participants recovered to normal feeding (21.9%). The relative risk of recovery was 1.61 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.73 to 3.58. No statistical significance was detected. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is not enough evidence to make any conclusion about the therapeutic effect of acupuncture for dysphagia after acute stroke. High quality and large scale randomised controlled trials are needed.

18514394|t|Thresholds of risk factors for ischemic stroke in type 2 diabetic patients with and without albuminuria: a non-linear approach.
18514394|a|OBJECTIVES: Multiple risk factors in type 2 diabetes may explain their high risk for ischemic stroke (IS). However, it remains unknown whether these risk factors exhibit threshold characteristics and whether these relationships are influenced by albuminuria. The study aims to investigate whether risk factors exhibit any albuminuria specific threshold for IS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study with 6969 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients without history of stroke after a median follow-up of 5.36 years. We identified thresholds of risk factors for IS using hazard ratio plots followed by confirmation using traditional Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: In the non-albuminuric group (n=4008), IS risk started to increase rapidly at a body mass index threshold of 24 kg/m(2). The risk of IS declined with increasing blood hemoglobin reaching a threshold value of 14 g/dl. Using these threshold values as cutoff point, body mass index > or =24 kg/m(2) and hemoglobin <14 g/dl were associated with 2-fold increased risk of IS in these subjects. In the albuminuric group (n=2961). IS risk started to increase rapidly from a systolic blood pressure threshold of 135 mmHg and declined with increasing estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reaching a trough of 115 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Using these values as cutoff points, patients with systolic blood pressure > or =135 mmHg and eGFR <115 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had 2-fold increased risk of IS. CONCLUSION: In type 2 diabetic patients, body mass index, hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure and eGFR exhibit different risk relationships and thresholds for IS contingent upon presence or absence of albuminuria.

18655557|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of acupuncture on quality of life (QOL) in post-ischemic stroke patients with dysphagia. METHODS: Sixty-six patients with dysphagia were randomly assigned to 3 groups, the 23 patients in the electro-acupuncture (EA) group treated by EA, 18 in the control group received rehabilitation training combined with acupoint percutaneous electric stimulation, and 25 in the acupoint token puncturing (TP) group received rehabilitation training combined with acupoint TP, once every day for 20 days in total. Changes in QOL scale specified for dysphagia of patients before and after treatment were compared. RESULTS: The total effective rate was 69.6% in the EA group, 50.0% in the control group and 64.0% in the TP group with insignificant difference among them (P > 0.05), but the improvements dealing with patients' general condition, time for taking food, frequency of uneasiness, emotion, appetite, social intercourse ability, fatigue, sleep and mental health, etc. in the EA group were superior to those in the other two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture could improve the QOL of patients with dysphagia after ischemic stroke.

18652322|t|[Clinical study on acupuncture combined with rehabilitation therapy for treatment of poststroke shoulder-hand syndrome].
18652322|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe therapeutic effect of acupuncture combined with rehabilitation therapy on poststroke shoulder-hand syndrome. METHODS: One hundred and twenty cases of poststroke shoulder-hand syndrome were randomly divided into an acupuncture-rehabilitation group, an acupuncture group and a rehabilitation group, 40 cases in each group. The acupuncture-rehabilitation group were treated with acupuncture at Jianyu (LI 15), Jianqian, Jianliao (TE 14), etc. in combination with motor therapy (rehabilitation training), the acupuncture group with simple acupuncture therapy, and the rehabilitation group with simple motor therapy. Upper extremity motor function, pain, joint activity were used for assessment of therapeutic effects. RESULTS: The total effective rate of 87.5% in the acupuncture-rehabilitation group was significantly better than 67.5% in the acupuncture group and 65.0% in the rehabilitation group (P<0.01); acupuncture combined with rehabilitation therapy could significantly improve upper limb motor function, pain and joint activity with very significant differences as compared with the acupuncture group and the rehabilitation group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture combined with rehabilitation therapy has a high cured rate and an obvious therapeutic effect on poststroke shoulder-hand syndrome.

18379054|t|Refined Qing Kai Ling, traditional Chinese medicinal preparation, reduces ischemic stroke-induced infarct size and neurological deficits and increases expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.
18379054|a|Refined Qing Kai Ling (RQKL) is an improved injectable multi-component preparation derived from Qing Kai Ling, which could offer the neuroprotection effect in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of rats by relieving the damage of vascular endothelial cell as well as inhibiting the process of inflammation. Herein, we observed whether RQKL could exert influence on the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), as a mechanism of its protective effects against ischemia. Sprague-Dawley rat model of focal cerebral ischemia was established by permanent filament occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. We found that the administration of RQKL could reduce the ischemic infarct size as well as neurological deficit of model rats. Furthermore, it was showed that the eNOS level was consistently increased in endothelium of blood vessels of the ischemic penumbra after 2 to 72 h of permanent MCAO, and the expression of eNOS increases more in animals treated with RQKL. Our results suggested that eNOS levels in penumbral zone were enhanced after permanent focal ischemia, and RQKL could stimulate postischemic eNOS expression, which may be an important mechanism in RQKL's protection against cerebral ischemia.

18360685|t|Induction of heme oxygenase-1 by traditional Chinese medicine formulation ISF-1 and its ingredients as a cytoprotective mechanism against oxidative stress.
18360685|a|Traditional medicines are clinically used to treat post-stroke disorders in China. In search of alternative medicines for post-stroke rehabilitation, we recently identified the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway as a key mechanism underlying the biological activities of the ischemic stroke formulation ISF-1. This study was designed to further investigate ISF-1 for HO-1 induction in cultured human cells and corresponding cytoprotective effects against oxidative injury. A rat stroke model induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion was employed to verify the activity of ISF-1 in vivo. It was found that HO-1 expression was induced by ISF-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Four ingredients from ISF-1 were identified to be responsible for HO-1 induction. The appropriate combinations of these active ingredients or purified compounds resulted in synergistic induction of HO-1 expression. A minimal HO-1-inducing formulation was prepared and showed significant cytoprotection against H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Collectively, the herbal formulation ISF-1 was capable of inducing HO-1 expression, in vitro and in vivo, offering a potential mechanism for post-stroke rehabilitation. This study may shed light on the development of mechanism-defined therapies based on traditional herbal remedies.

18333921|t|Evaluation of the cardiovascular function of older adult Rhesus monkeys by ultrasonography.
18333921|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiovascular structure and function of older adult Rhesus monkey by utrasonography. METHODS: Sixteen monkeys aged from 17 to 20 years and weighing from 8.2 to 15.3 kg, six adults aged 7-8 years and weighing from 8.1 to 9.2 kg. All monkeys were determined to be free from hypertension, hyperglycaemia and cardiac disease. The normal values of index related to heart and blood vessels including structure, haemodynamics and systolic or diastolic function were detected by 2D, M-mode, pulsed Doppler and tissue Doppler echocardiography respectively under ketamine hydrochloride sedation. Meanwhile, blood pressures were also measured by electronic sphygmomanometer. Each monkey underwent repeated detections in 2 weeks and all data were analysed with statistical methods. RESULTS: Compared with young adult monkeys, the older's heart rate (HR), the left ventricular diastolic function and the compliance of big artery including right and left common carotid artery, bulbus caroticus, internal carotid artery and abdominal aorta were decreased and the associated indexes changed significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Meanwhile, older monkeys exhibited significant increase in the aorta diameter (AO), amplitude of aortic wall (AAO), left atrial diameter (LAD), end diastolic volume of left ventricle (EDV), stroke volume (SV), left ventricular mass (LVM) (P < 0.05 vs. young adult monkeys); however, cardiac output (CO) only slightly increased but the difference did not reach the statistical significance (P = 0.418, P = 0.644 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrated the profiles of cardiovascular function and structure in the older Rhesus monkeys. Older monkey is accompanied by diminished left ventricular diastolic function and big artery compliance. Ultrasonography provides a means to non-invasively evaluate the anatomy and function of the heart and blood vessel, and plays an increasingly important role in the drug evaluation against cardiovascular dysfunction.

18405599|t|[Characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine syndromes in patients with acute ischemic stroke of yin or yang syndrome: a multicenter trial].
18405599|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the composition characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes in patients with acute ischemic stroke of yin or yang syndrome by investigating the characteristics of TCM syndromes at different periods after onset. METHODS: One thousand two hundred and forty-six patients with acute ischemic stroke were admitted in twenty hospitals. According to the "diagnostic criteria of syndrome differentiation of stroke", the characteristics of syndromes in the patients were investigated at the periods of 1-3 days, 4-10 days and 11-30 days after they had ischemic stroke. General distribution of six basic syndromes was compared between the patients with yin syndrome and the patients with yang syndrome at the three periods. The six basic syndromes were wind syndrome, pathogenic fire syndrome, phlegm syndrome, blood stasis syndrome, qi deficiency syndrome, and syndrome of yin deficiency and yang hyperactivity. RESULTS: The percentages of wind, pathogenic fire, and phlegm syndromes in the patients were decreased at the period of 11-30 days as compared with the period of 1-3 days (87.1% vs 79.3%, 52.1% vs 38.7% and 67.1% vs 57.4% respectively, P<0.01). However, the percentages of the syndromes of blood stasis, qi deficiency, and yin deficiency and yang hyperactivity were similar at the three periods (P>0.05). There were no differences in the distribution of yin and yang syndromes among the three periods (P>0.05). The percentages of syndromes of wind, pathogenic fire, phlegm, and yin deficiency and yang hyperactivity were higher (P<0.01), and the percentages of syndromes of blood stasis and qi deficiency were lower (P<0.05, P<0.01) in patients with yang syndrome than in patients with yin syndrome. The complex of three syndromes was the most frequent composition pattern in the patients at the three periods. The percentages of complex syndromes of four or five syndromes were higher, and the percentages of single-syndromes and complex syndromes of two syndromes were lower in patients with yang syndrome than in patients with yin syndrome (P<0.05, P<0.01). The most frequent complex syndromes in patients with yin syndrome were complex syndrome of wind, phlegm, blood stasis and qi deficiency, and complex syndrome of wind, phlegm and qi deficiency; while the most frequent complex syndromes in patients with yang syndrome were complex syndrome of wind, pathogenic fire, phlegm and qi deficiency, and complex syndrome of wind, pathogenic fire and phlegm. CONCLUSION: The main discrimination between the yin and yang syndromes is that the yang syndrome is characterized by pathogenic fire. The syndromes of phlegm, qi deficiency, and blood stasis are not associated with the diagnosis of yin or yang syndrome.

18481718|t|[Clinical observation on acupuncture with pushing manipulation for treatment of finger flexion in the patient of poststroke].
18481718|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare therapeutic effects of acupuncture with pushing manipulation and routine acupuncture on finger flexion in the patient of poststroke. METHODS: Eighty cases were randomly divided into a group of acupuncture with pushing manipulation and a routine acupuncture group. Hegu (LI 4), Houxi (SI 3), Waiguan (TE 5) were selected in the both groups. For the group of acupuncture with pushing manipulation (n=42), after arrival of qi acupuncture with pushing manipulation was given, the needle was inserted forcedly downwards, heavily thrust and lightly lifted with the thumb forward and the index-finger backward, and the needle was retained for 30 min. For the routine acupuncture group, after arrival of qi the needle was retained for 30 min. The therapeutic effects were assessed by modified Ashworth spastic rating and activity of metacarpophalangeal articulations after treatment of 30 days and 60 days in the two groups. RESULTS: The total effective rate of 81.0% in the group of acupuncture with pushing manipulation was significantly better than 57.9% in the routine acupuncture group (P<0.05); there was a significant or a very significant difference between the two groups in changes of the spastic degree and the activity of metacarpophalangeal articulations after treatment (P<0.05, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture with pushing manipulation has a definite therapeutic effect on finger flexion in the patient of poststroke.

18361815|t|[Expression of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 in the plasma and hematoma fluid of intracerebral hemorrhage patients].
18361815|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 played in secondary brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS: Hematoma fluid and peripheral blood samples were collected from 60 ICH patients, 34 males and 26 females, aged 60 +/- 13 (37 - 81) n the days 1, 4, and 7 after evacuation of hematoma. Peripheral blood samples were collected form. 30 sex, and age-matched healthy adults as normal controls. Cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) samples were collected from 10 sex, and age-matched patients to undergo operation during lumbar anesthesia. ELISA was used to detect the content of MMP-9. Tada formula was used to calculate the perihematomal edema volume. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHHS) and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) were used to assess the condition of patients. RESULTS: (1) The MMP-9 levels in the plasma and hematoma fluid of the ICH patients at all time points were all significantly higher than those of the normal controls (all P < 0.01). MMP-9 was not found in the normal CSF. (2) The plasma and hematoma fluid MMP-9 levels were increased already in the day 1, peaked in the day 4, and then kept at a high level until the day 7. (3) The MMP-9 levels in hematoma fluid t all time points were all significantly higher than those in the plasma (all P < 0.01). (4) The MMP-9 level was positively correlated with the hematoma volume and NIHSS score, and negatively correlated with the GCS score (both P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: MMP-9 may takes part in the secondary injury after ICH, and its change is correlated with the hydrocephalus of patients. The dynamical change of the plasma MMP-9 level is consistent with the hematoma fluid MMP-9 level after ICH. There is a positive correlation among the MMP-9 level, perihematomal edema volume, and severity of ICH.

19051339|t|Ferulic acid reduces cerebral infarct through its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects following transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
19051339|a|Both Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (AS) and Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. (LC) have been used to treat stroke in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Ferulic acid (FA), a component in both AS and LC, plays a role in neuroprotection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of FA on cerebral infarct and the involvement of neuroprotective pathway. Rats underwent 2 hours and 24 hours of reperfusion after 90 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). The cerebral infarct and neurological deficits were measured after 24 hours of reperfusion. Furthermore, the expression of superoxide radicals, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) immunoreactive cells were assessed after 2 hours and 24 hours of reperfusion. Administration of 80 and 100 mg/kg of FA at the beginning of MCAo significantly reduced cerebral infarct and neurological deficit-score, similar results were obtained by 100 mg/kg of FA administered 30 min after MCAo. FA treatment (100 mg/kg i.v.) effectively suppressed superoxide radicals in the parenchyma lesion, and ICAM-1 immunoreactive vessels in the ischemic striatum after 2 hours of reperfusion. FA (100 mg/kg i.v.) reduced the expression of ICAM-1 and NF-kappaB in the ischemic cortex and striatum, also down-regulated MPO immunoreactive cells in the ischemic cortex after 24 hours of reperfusion. These results showed that the effect of FA on reducing cerebral infarct area and neurological deficit-score were at least partially attributed to the inhibition of superoxide radicals, ICAM-1 and NF-kappaB expression in transient MCAo rats.

18417963|t|Danqi Piantan Jiaonang does not modify hemostasis, hematology, and biochemistry in normal subjects and stroke patients.
18417963|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous studies on Danqi Piantan Jiaonang (DPJ, NeuroAid), a traditional Chinese medicine, in stroke patients showed promising results. Our aim was to determine the safety of DPJ in normal subjects and stroke patients through a series of studies assessing its immediate and long-term effects, alone and in combination with aspirin, on hematological, hemostatic, and biochemical parameters. METHODS: We conducted 3 studies from December 2004 to May 2006. Study 1 was a case series which recruited 32 healthy volunteers who were given 2 oral doses of 4 DPJ capsules (0.4 g/capsule) 6 h apart. Study 2 was a randomized controlled trial of 22 healthy volunteers who received either 1 oral dose of aspirin 300 mg alone or a combination of 1 dose of aspirin 300 mg and 2 doses of 4 DPJ capsules taken 6 h apart. For both studies 1 and 2, hemostatic parameters (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, platelet aggregation, D-dimer) were tested at baseline, and after 2 and 8 h. Study 3 was a case series which recruited 10 patients with recent ischemic stroke (within 7 days) who were given 4 DPJ capsules taken orally 3 times a day for 1 month. Blood tests for hemostatic, hematological (complete blood count), and biochemical parameters (glucose, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, C-reactive protein) were performed at baseline, and after 1 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: Apart from the expected changes in platelet aggregation in subjects taking aspirin, no significant differences were detected in hemostatic parameters at baseline, and 2 and 8 h after oral intake of DPJ alone or in combination with aspirin. Likewise, no significant differences were observed in hematological, hemostatic, and biochemical parameters at baseline, and after 1 and 4 weeks of oral intake of DPJ. CONCLUSION: DPJ does not significantly modify hematological, hemostatic, and biochemical parameters in normal subjects and stroke patients.

18184550|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the tongue tissue blood oxygen saturation measurement for evaluating tongue manifestation of blood stasis syndrome, and to explore its correlation with blood rheological disorder in a rat model of acute transient brain ischemia. METHODS: Twenty-eight SD rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group and ischemia group. Middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced by thread in rats of the ischemia group. Tongue tissue blood oxygen saturation, neurological severity score and the changes of blood viscosity, red blood cell deformity, thrombin time and fibrinogen in the rats were measured after 24-hour reperfusion. RESULTS: Blood viscosity and the content of fibrinogen in the ischemia group were significantly higher than those in the sham-operated group. Red blood cell deformity, thrombin time and tongue tissue blood oxygen saturation in the ischemia group were decreased as compared with the sham-operated group. There was a positive correlation between red blood cell deformity and tongue tissue blood oxygen saturation. CONCLUSION: Tongue tissue blood oxygen saturation is a good measurement for evaluating blood stasis in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia, and this model can be used as a rat model of stroke with blood stasis syndrome.

18257178|t|[Clinical observation on abdominal electroacupuncture for treatment of poststroke constipation].
18257178|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare therapeutic effects of abdominal electroacupuncture (EA) and western medicine on poststroke constipation. METHODS: Eighty cases were randomly divided into an EA group and a medication group, 40 cases in each group. The EA group were treated with EA at Daheng (SP 15), Fujie (SP 14), Tianshu (ST 25), Shuidao (ST 28), etc., once a day, 30 min each session, and the medication group with oral administration of 10 mg Cisapride, thrice each day. Seven days constituted one course. After 2 courses, clinical therapeutic effects were evaluated by cumulative scores of symptoms. RESULTS: The total effective rate of 92.5% in the EA group was significantly better than 72.5% in the medication group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the cumulative scores of clinical symptoms significantly decreased in the two groups (P < 0.05) and the improving degrees of symptoms in the EA group was significantly better than that in the medication group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Abdominal electroacupuncture has a definite therapeutic effect on poststroke constipation, accelerating gastrointestinal movement.

17897641|t|Neuroprotective effects of emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside in vivo and in vitro.
17897641|a|Emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc is widely used to treat acute hepatitis possibly by antioxidative mechanisms. The present study was designed to investigate whether emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside exerted neuroprotective effects on the focal cerebral injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion in vivo and on the neuronal damage induced by glutamate in vitro, and to study the possible mechanisms. Male Wistar rats were used to establish the model of ischemia and reperfusion. The behavioral test was performed and the cerebral infarction area was assessed in the brain slices stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, total antioxidative capability and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the brain tissue were determined with spectrophotometrical methods to probe the primary mechanisms of emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside. In vitro, the neuroprotective effects of emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside were tested in the cultured cortical cells of fetal rats exposed to glutamate. Emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside concentration in plasma and brain tissue was also measured to examine distribution of emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside in the brain. The results showed that the treatment of rats with emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside reduced the neurological deficit score and the cerebral infarction area, increased SOD activity and total antioxidative capability, and decreased MDA level in the brain tissue in dose-dependent way. Emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside also inhibited the neuronal damage induced by glutamate. Besides, emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside was able to penetrate blood-brain barrier and distribute in the brain tissue. These findings demonstrate that emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside is able to provide neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia-reperfused injury and glutamate induced neuronal damage through exerting antioxidative effects and inhibiting glutamate neurotoxicity.

18246677|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical therapeutic effects of treatment for acute cerebral infarction with the combined use of acupuncture and drugs, and study the therapeutic mechanism. METHODS: 88 cases of acute cerebral infarction were divided randomly into two groups, a treatment group of 46 cases treated with acupuncture, Danshen Zhushe Ye (Saliva Injection) and routine western drugs and a control group of 42 cases treated simply with drugs. The therapeutic effects were evaluated based on the evaluation criteria for damage of the nerve function. Observation was also made on changes in the skull CT images, and in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in serums, and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) in serums. RESULTS: After treatment for 15 days, the total effective rate of the treatment group reached 80.43%, while that of the control group was 61.90%, showing significant differences. The effective rate shown by the skull CT images of the treatment group was 51.61%, while that of the control group was 45.16%, showing no significant differences. But as compared with the control group, the activities of SOD and GSH-px in serums were significantly enhanced, and the levels of MDA and NO, and activity of NOS in serums were significantly decreased in the treatment group. CONCLUSION: The prompt acupuncture treatment of acute cerebral infarction can markedly raise the clinical therapeutic effects, improve the activity of SOD and GSH-px in serums, lower down the level of MDA in serum, and markedly decrease NO level and NOS activity in serums.

18257348|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe effect of acupuncture on hemiplegia spasticity of the patient with stroke and to probe an effective acupuncture method for treatment of the hemiplegia spasticity. METHODS: Ninety-six cases of hemiplegia spasticity were randomly divided into a common acupuncture group, and a balance yin-yang acupuncture group. All the patients were treated with routine medicine and rehabilitation training. In the common acupuncture group, traditional acupoint selection method was used with the acupoints on the yang channels such as Jianyu (LI 15), Quchi (LI 11), Shousanli (LI 10) selected; in the balance yin-yang acupuncture group, the acupoints on the yin channels and the yang channels were combined, with Jiquan (HT 1), Chize (LU 5), Shaohai (HT 3) etc. selected, according to the TCM theory of yin for chronic and yang for acute and imbalance of muscular tension between the extensor and flesor in the patient of hemiplegia. Before and after treatment, neurological defect scoring criterion, modified Ashworth, daily living ability (ADL-Barthel index) and SIAS were respectively used for evaluation of the therapeutic effects. RESULTS: Acupuncture could significantly improve spastic dyskinesia of the patient of hemiplegia due to stroke and increase daily living ability. After treatment, the neurological defect score was 16.56 +/- 7.97, ADL-Barthel index was 57.20 +/- 12.80 in the treatment group, and 21.62 +/- 7.17, 30.66 +/- 11.34 in the control group, with very significant differences (both P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can improve spastic dyskinesia of the patient of hemiplegia due to stroke and increase daily living ability, but different needling methods have different effects.

19127844|t|[The development of the cognition and treatment of apoplexy in traditional Chinese medicine].
19127844|a|Surveying the developmental history of the cognition and treatment of apoplexy in traditional Chinese medicine, it could be divided into 3 phases, viz. the phase of "exogenous wind" before the Tang and Song dynasties, the phase of contention of "endogenous wind" during the Jin, Yuan and Ming dynasties, and the phase of compromising of traditional Chinese and consulting of western medicine of "equal importance of exogenous and endogenous wind" after the Qing dynasty. Through the development of these three phases, the cognition of cause of disease and pathogenesis of apoplexy was deepened continuously, and the method of treatment, prescription and materia medica were enriched further. Especially, with the introduction and usage of modern scientific technology, the diagnosis and treatment of apoplexy were more standardized, and the effect was improved constantly, reflecting the characteristic and superiority of traditional Chinese medicine.

17692486|t|Buyang Huanwu Decoction can improve recovery of neurological function, reduce infarction volume, stimulate neural proliferation and modulate VEGF and Flk1 expressions in transient focal cerebral ischaemic rat brains.
17692486|a|Buyang Huanwu Decoction is a classic formula for treating stroke-induced disability in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). To explore its pharmacological basis, we investigated the effects of the whole formula and its herbal components on the neurological behavior performance and infarction volume in focal cerebral ischaemia rats. The neurological deficit scores and infarction volume were measured at days 3, 7 and 14 after 30 min of occlusion of middle cerebral artery. The results showed that Buyang Huanwu Decoction and its herbal components significantly improved the neurological behavior performances and reduced the infarction volume in the ischaemic brains. To elucidate the potential therapeutic mechanisms, we investigated the proliferation of progenitors by detecting the immunohistochemical staining of thymidine analog 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and found that the formula stimulated the proliferation of the progenitors at hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ) in the ischaemic brains. As vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor fetal liver kinase (Flk1) are important neurotrophic, neuroprotective and neuroproliferative factors, we studied the expressions of VEGF and Flk1 in the hippocampus, SVZ and cortex in the ischaemic brains and found that the formula led to increase the numbers of VEGF-positive and Flk1-positive cells in the SVZ and cortex in the ischaemic brains. The results indicate that the therapeutic effects of Buyang Huanwu Decoction for recovery of neurological deficits are associated with the stimulation of the proliferation of progenitors and the enhancement of the expressions of VEGF and Flk in ischaemic brains.

17692485|t|Buyang Huanwu Decoction promotes growth and differentiation of neural progenitor cells: using a serum pharmacological method.
17692485|a|Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been developed as a drug to be used for treatment of stroke for hundreds of years. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, a serum pharmacological method was employed to investigate the effects of BYHWD on growth and differentiation of cultured neural progenitor cells derived from embryonic hippocampus. In culture medium containing BYHWD, the average neurite length of neural progenitor cells grew significantly longer than in control serum without BYHWD. Moreover, more neurofilament (NF) positive cells and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells were detected in the presence of BYHWD. The concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) in progenitor cells cultured with BYHWD was significantly lower than that cultured without BYHWD. These results suggest that BYHWD may promote growth and differentiation of neural progenitor cells.

17408986|t|Cerebrosides of baifuzi, a novel potential blocker of calcium-activated chloride channels in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells.
17408986|a|Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) are crucial regulators of vascular tone by promoting a depolarizing influence on the resting membrane potential of vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the lack of a special blocker of CaCCs has limited the investigation of its functions for long time. Here, we report that CB is a novel potential blocker of I(Cl(Ca)) in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC). Cerebrosides (CB) were isolated from Baifuzi which is dried root tuber of the herb Typhonium giganteum Engl used for treatment of stroke in traditional medicine. Using the voltage-clamp technique, sustained Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (I(Cl(Ca))) was evoked by a K(+)-free pipette solution containing 500nM Ca(2+) which exhibited typical outwardly rectifying and voltage-/time-dependence characterization. Data showed that CB played a distinct inhibitory role in modulating the CaCCs. Moreover, we investigated the kinetic effect of CB on I(Cl(Ca)) and found that it could slow the activation dynamics of the outward current, accelerate the decay of the inward tail current and change the time-dependence characterization. We conclude that CB is a novel potent blocker of CaCCs. The interaction between CB and CaCCs is discussed.

17307317|t|Genome-wide biological response fingerprinting (BioReF) of the Chinese botanical formulation ISF-1 enables the selection of multiple marker genes as a potential metric for quality control.
17307317|a|Quality control plays a critical role in the process of translating the traditional/alternative medicines into modern evidence-based therapies. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is widely applied to assess the chemical composition of botanical drug products. The chromatographic fingerprints or chemical profiles are currently used as the de facto quality control metric. As a complement to chemical profiles, a biological quality control assessment offers distinct advantages. This study describes a genome-wide biological response fingerprinting (BioReF) approach to define a set of marker genes that define a signature pattern for a specific botanical formulation. These marker genes are chosen on the basis of the levels of the regulated expression and the involvement in the cellular signaling pathways. Subsequently, qRT-PCR technique is used to simultaneously monitor the gene expression of multiple marker genes in an efficient and quantitative manner. This set of marker genes represents the biological responses of human cells to the chemical composition of the botanical drug that could serve as potential quality control of botanical drugs in terms of the consistency of biological activities. We demonstrate the BioReF approach with a well-documented Chinese Medicine formula, designated as ISF-1, traditionally used for the management of post-stroke disorders. A set of nine marker genes were selected to assess the batch-to-batch consistency of the biological effects of ISF-1. This approach provides a potential comprehensive and cost-effective quality control metric of the biological activities of botanical drugs.

17636800|t|Acupuncture for insomnia.
17636800|a|BACKGROUND: Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are still widely practiced. However, it remains unclear whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in people with insomnia. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED (the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), TCMLARS (Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System), National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database, the Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, the Trials Register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, from inception to 2006, and the sleep bibliography, which is available at www.websciences.org/bibliosleep. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture involving participants of any age with any type of insomnia were included. Included trials compared acupuncture with placebo or sham or no treatment, or acupuncture plus other treatments compared with the same other treatments. Trials that compared only acupuncture methods or compared acupuncture alone against other treatments alone were excluded, since they did not yield the net effect of acupuncture. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality according to a set of criteria for risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias. Relative risk (RR) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were used for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. Data were combined in meta-analyses (on an intention-to-treat basis), where more than one trial without significant clinical heterogeneity presented the same outcome. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials met the inclusion criteria. The studies included 590 participants with insomnia, of whom 56 dropped out. Participant age ranged from 15 to 98 years, and the duration of insomnia varied from 6 months to 19 years. Co-existing medical conditions contributing to insomnia included stroke, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. Apart from conventional needle acupuncture, different variants of acupuncture such as acupressure, auricular magnetic and seed therapy, and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) were evaluated. Meta-analysis was limited because of considerable heterogeneity between comparison groups and between outcome measures. Based on the findings from individual trials, the review suggested that acupuncture and acupressure may help to improve sleep quality scores when compared to placebo (SMD = -1.08, 95% CI = -1.86 to -0.31, p=0.006) or no treatment (SMD -0.55, 95% CI = -0.89 to -0.21, p=0.002). TEAS also resulted in better sleep quality score in one trial (SMD = -0.74, 95% CI = -1.22 to -0.26, p=0.003). However, the efficacy of acupuncture or its variants was inconsistent between studies for many sleep parameters, such as sleep onset latency, total sleep duration and wake after sleep onset. The combined result from three studies reporting subjective insomnia improvement showed that acupuncture or its variants was not more significantly effective than control (RR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.68 to -4.03) and significant statistical heterogeneity was observed. Only one study reported an adverse event, with one out of 16 patients (6.3%) withdrawing from acupuncture because of pain. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The small number of randomised controlled trials, together with the poor methodological quality and significant clinical heterogeneity, means that the current evidence is not sufficiently extensive or rigorous to support the use of any form of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. Larger high quality clinical trials employing appropriate randomisation concealment and blinding with longer follow-up are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia.

This study used 18-flourodeoxyglucose PET measures to compare cerebral effects of conventional acupuncture for hemiplegia with that of additional VaD-specific needling. As compared to baseline, conventional acupuncture increased glucose metabolism in the temporal lobe of unaffected and in the lentiform nucleus of the affected hemisphere. Additional needling in VaD-specific points rendered higher metabolism bilaterally in the frontal lobes and the thalamus, and in the temporal lobe and the lentiform nucleus of the unaffected hemisphere. The findings further underpin acupuncture's role in stroke and VaD rehabilitation.

17698456|t|Adjunctive care with nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic complementary and alternative medicine modalities in stroke treatment and rehabilitation.
17698456|a|This article presents an overview of nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic treatment options from complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as adjuncts in stroke prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. Despite many promising leads, the evidence does not favor recommendation of most of these treatments from a public health policy perspective. However, simple preventive interventions such as use of a high-quality multivitamin/multimineral supplement in patients with undernutrition may improve outcomes with minimal long-term risk. Natural agents such as the antioxidant alphalipoic acid, certain traditional Asian herbal mixtures, and some homeopathically prepared remedies show promise for reducing infarct size and associated impairments. A number of nutrients and herbs may assist in treatment of stroke-related complications such as pressure sores, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia. Individualized homeopathy may even play a helpful adjunctive role in treatment of sepsis. However, a great deal of systematic research effort lies ahead before most of the options discussed would meet mainstream medical standards for introduction into routine treatment regimens.

17583826|t|Neuroprotective effects of a standardized extract of Diospyros kaki leaves on MCAO transient focal cerebral ischemic rats and cultured neurons injured by glutamate or hypoxia.
17583826|a|Naoxinqing (NXQ, a standardized extract of Diospyros kaki leaves) is a patented and approved drug of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used for the treatment of apoplexy syndrome for years in China, but its underlying mechanism remains to be further elucidated. The present study investigates the effects of NXQ against focal ischemia/reperfusion injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats and against glutamate-induced cell injury of hippocampal neurons as well as against hypoxia injury of cortical neurons. Oral administrations of NXQ at 20, 40, 80 mg/kg/day for 7 days (3 days before MCAO and 4 days after MCAO) significantly reduced the lesion of the insulted brain hemisphere and improved the neurological behavior of the rats. In primary rat hippocampal neuron cultures, treatment with NXQ at 5 - 20 microg mL concentration protects the neurons against glutamate-induced excitotoxic death in a dose-dependent manner. In primary rat cerebral cortical neuron cultures, pretreatment with 5 - 100 microg/mL NXQ also attenuates hypoxia-reoxygen induced neuron death and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that NXQ significantly protects the rats from MCAO ischemic injury in vivo and the hippocampal neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxic injury as well as cortical neurons from hypoxia injury in vitro by synergistic mechanisms involving its antioxidative effects.

17463317|t|Meta-analysis of traditional Chinese patent medicine for ischemic stroke.
17463317|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A large number of traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM) are widely used for ischemic stroke in China. The aim of this study was to systematically review the existing clinical evidence on TCPM for ischemic stroke. METHODS: We identified all TCPM that were listed in the Chinese National Essential Drug list of 2004 and those commonly used TCPM in current clinical practice for ischemic stroke. Fifty-nine TCPM were identified for further evaluation. We applied Cochrane systematic review methods. We searched for reports of randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials on any of the 59 TCPM for ischemic stroke comparing one TCPM with control. PRIMARY OUTCOMES included death or dependency at the end of follow-up (at least 3 months) and adverse events. Effects on neurological impairments were a secondary outcome. RESULTS: One-hundred ninety-one trials (19,338 patients) on 22 TCPM were available and included, of which 120 were definite or possible randomized controlled trials and 71 were controlled clinical trials. The methodological quality of included trials was generally "poor." Few trials reported methods of randomization. Three trials were randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: one trial on Puerarin and one trial on Shenmai injection assessed death or dependency at the end of long-term follow-up (at least 3 months) and found no statistically significant difference between 2 groups. The reported adverse events including allergic reaction, headache, nausea, diarrhea, bellyache, blood pressure change, and subcutaneous ecchymosis. Most of the adverse events were not severe. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: analysis of the secondary outcome, "marked improvement in neurological deficit," showed apparent benefits of about the same magnitude for all the TCPM studied. Of the 22 TCPM, 8 drugs (Milk vetch, Mailuoning, Ginkgo biloba, Ligustrazine, Danshen agents, Xuesetong, Puerarin, and Acanthopanax) had relatively more studies and patient numbers. CONCLUSIONS: There was insufficient good quality evidence on the effects of TCPM in ischemic stroke on the primary outcome (death or dependency). We considered the apparent benefit on neurological impairment was as likely to be attributable to bias from poor methodology as to a real treatment effect. However, because the agents assessed appeared potentially beneficial and nontoxic, further randomized controlled trials are justified. Eight drugs could be further research priorities.

17498496|t|[Effects of Panax notoginseng saponins on mRNA expressions of interleukin-1 beta, its correlative factors and cysteinyl-aspartate specific protease after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats].
17498496|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) on mRNA expressions of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), cysteinyl-aspartate specific protease-1 (caspase-1), caspase-3 and caspase-8 after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion in rats was induced by the method of nylon monofilament via the internal carotid artery. PNS was administered intraperitoneally respectively five minutes before cerebral ischemia and twelve hours after cerebral ischemia. After cerebral ischemia for two hours followed by reperfusion for twenty two hours, the mRNA expressions of IL-1 beta, IL-1RI, IL-1ra, ICAM-1, caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 in brain tissue were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: After cerebral ischemia for two hours followed by reperfusion for twenty two hours, the mRNA expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-1RI, IL-1ra, ICAM-1, caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 in brain tissue in the untreated group were obviously elevated as compared to those in the sham-operation group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The mRNA expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-1RI, IL-1ra in brain tissue in the PNS group were lower than those in the untreated group, but higher than those in the sham-operation group, and without statistical differences as compared to those in the sham-operation group and in the untreated group (P>0.05). The mRNA expression level of caspase-3 in brain tissue in the PNS group was significantly lower than that in the untreated group (P<0.05), but PNS had no effect on the mRNA expression levels of ICAM-1, caspase-1 and caspase-8 in brain tissue. CONCLUSION: PNS can inhibit the mRNA expression of caspase-3, slightly inhibit the mRNA expressions of IL-1 beta and its correlative inflammatory factors in brain tissue. The protective effects of PNS on cerebral injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion may be related to inhibiting the mRNA expressions of caspase-3, IL-1 beta and its correlative inflammatory factors in brain tissue.

17498487|t|[Effect evaluation for comprehensive treatment of acute stage of stroke].
17498487|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical evaluation system reflecting the superiority and characteristics of comprehensive traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy for acute stroke. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial with single blind in various therapeutic centers was applied on the patients with the acute stage of hemorrhagic stroke due to hypertension, who were allocated to the trial group and the control group. The trial group accepted the general Western medicine therapy and differential treatment of traditional Chinese medicine based on stage classification. Patients in the control group were treated with the general Western medicine and the placebo of traditional Chinese herbal medicine. The treatment effect was assessed at the 7th day, 14th day, 21st day, and 28th day of post-treatment and after 3-month follow-up. The clinical evaluation system included the syndromes of TCM (ZH), Glasgow coma standard (GCS), nerve functional failure (NF), activity of daily living (ADL), Barther index (BI), quality of life index (QLI) and functional activities questionnaire (FAQ). RESULTS: Four hundred and four patients with acute stroke were included. There were 178 cases with yang-syndrome and 21 cases with yin-syndrome in the trial group (n=199), and there were 165 cases with yang-syndrome and 40 cases with yin-syndrome in the control group (n=205). The rates of recovery and obvious improvement after 3-month treatment in the trial group and the control group were 86.5% and 73.6% respectively. There was significant difference between the two groups (P<0.01). The response sensitivity of the effect items indicated that the sensitivity of GCS began to increase from the 7th day and was high at the 14th day and the 21st day for all patients. The response sensitivity of the NF scale was high for all patients at the 14th day, the 21st day and the 28th day. The BI scale and the QLI scale were sensitive to the patients with light and middle stage of stroke at the 21st day, and were sensitive to the patients with light stage of stroke after 3-month follow-up. The FAQ scale was sensitive to the light stroke at the 21st day and after 3-month follow-up. The ADL scale was sensitive to all patients at the 28th day and the patients with light stage of stroke after 3-month follow-up. The ZH scale was sensitive to all patients from 0 to 7d, the 14th day, and the 28th day. The principle components analysis indicated these 7 items could reflect the condition of stroke from 0-7d, the 21st day and after 3-month follow-up, and could be used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of hemorrhagic stroke. ZH scale and FAQ scale were more sensitive than other effect items at the 28th day. CONCLUSION: The seven items (GCSbNFbBIbQLIbFAQbADLbZH) have high sensibility to all patients in the acute stage of hemorrhage stroke especially at the 21st day. The ZH score will change in accord with the condition of stroke, and is appropriate to reflect the condition of stroke. It is believed that the seven items can form the system of effect evaluation in different stages of stroke, and the ZH scale is a very important item.

17655154|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the protective effect of Niuhuang Shangqing pills (NSP) on the experimental cerebral ischemia and the influence of blood rheology in animals. METHOD: Using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), bilateral common carotid artery ligation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in combination with carrogeenin (Ca)-induced stagnation of blood model rats, we investigated the influence of NSP on the physical sign indexes, brain infarct size and the water content, the content of lactate(LD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA) and the blood rheology. RESULT: The 3.00, 1.50 g x kg(-1) dosage groups of NSP decreased the neurosigns indexes, significantly reduced the brain infarct areas in MCAO rats, decreased the brain water content, increased the activities of GPx and CAT, decreased the content of LD and MDA in bilateral common carotid artery ligation rats. They improved the blood rheology in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in combination with carrogeenin (Ca)-induced stagnation of blood model rats. CONCLUSION: NSP has the function of protective effect on experimental experimental cerebral ischemia.

17215084|t|Protective effects of carotenoids from saffron on neuronal injury in vitro and in vivo.
17215084|a|Crocus sativus L. (saffron) has been used as a spice for flavoring and coloring food preparations, and in Chinese traditional medicine as an anodyne or tranquilizer. Our previous study demonstrated that crocin, a carotenoid pigment of saffron, can suppress the serum deprivation-induced death of PC12 cells by increasing glutathione (GSH) synthesis and thus inhibiting neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) activity and ceramide formation. The carotenoid pigments of saffron consist of crocetin di-(beta-d-glucosyl)-ester [dicrocin], crocetin-(beta-d-gentiobiosyl)-(beta-d-glucosyl)-ester [tricrocin] and crocetin-di-(beta-d-gentiobiosyl)-ester [crocin]. Saffron also contains picrocrocin, the substance causing saffron's bitter taste. In this study, to confirm whether neuroprotective effects of saffron are caused solely by crocin, we examined the antioxidant and GSH-synthetic activities of these crocins in PC12 cells under serum-free and hypoxic conditions. Measurements of cell viability, peroxidized membrane lipids and caspase-3 activity showed that the rank order of the neuroprotective potency at a concentration of 10 muM was crocin>tricrocin>dicrocin and picrocrocin (the latter two crocins had a little or no potency). In addition, we show that among these saffron's constituents, crocin most effectively promotes mRNA expression of gamma-glutamylcysteinyl synthase (gamma-GCS), which contributes to GSH synthesis as the rate-limiting enzyme, and that the carotenoid can significantly reduce infarcted areas caused by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in mice.

17432684|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of three traditional Chinese medicinal compounds on energy metabolism related enzymes in cerebral tissue of rats after focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). METHODS: The local cerebral I/R model was established by ligation of the middle cerebral arteries (MCA). The animals were divided into the sham-operative group, the model group, the Yiqi Huoxue Recipe (YHR) group, the Zhengan Xifeng Decoction (ZXD) group and the Xinglou Chengqi Decoction (XCD) group. The mitochondria in brain tissue was obtained by density-centrifugation and differential centrifugation, then the activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), Na+ -K+ -ATPase, creatine kinase-BB (CK-BB) in homogenate of brain tissue were measured by chemical chromometry. RESULTS: Activities of SDH and Na+-K+ -ATPase were lower and that of CK-BB was higher in the model group than those in the sham -operative group at all time points after I/R (P< 0.01). Compared with those in the model group, activity of Na+ -K+ -ATPase was higher only in the ZXD group at 24 h after I/R, while at 48 h and 72 h after I/R, activities of both SDH and Na+ -K+ -ATPase were higher in all the treatment groups. As for the activity of CK-BB, it was lower in all the treatment groups (P < 0.05). The optimal effect was shown in the ZXD group at 24 h, in the XCD group at 48 h, and in the YHR group at 72 h after I/R. CONCLUSION: The three traditional Chinese medicinal compounds could reduce pathologic injury after focal cerebral I/R in rats by promoting activity of SDH and Na+ -K+ -ATPase and inhibiting that of CK-BB, the optimal effect of ZXD was shown at 24 h after I/R, that of XCD at 48 h after I/R and of YHR at 72 h after I/R.

17963318|t|Acupuncture stimulation at Baihui acupoint reduced cerebral infarct and increased dopamine levels in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemia-reperfusion injured sprague-dawley rats.
17963318|a|The Baihui acupoint has three Yang and five convergences; it is needled in order to activate spirit and resuscitate the brain in traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of acupuncture stimulation at the Baihui acupoint on cerebral infarct and dopamine levels. A chronic cerebral hypoperfusion animal model was established by permanent ligation of both common carotid arteries; a cerebral infarct animal model was established by blocking the blood flow of both common carotid arteries and the right middle cerebral artery for 90 min followed by reperfusion in Sprague-Dawly (SD) rats. The Baihui acupoint was stimulated for 20 min 3 days per week for 4 weeks. The cognitive and memory functions were evaluated by measuring the successful rates for rats to negotiate an 8-arm radial maze test; the test was performed after operation once a week for 4 weeks. Finally, the rats were sacrificed and their brains were removed; the dopamine levels in brain tissue were measured and the percentage of right to left hemisphere area was calculated. The results indicated that acupuncture stimulation (AS) did not increase the success rate of performing the 8-arm radial maze in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injured rat models. AS increased dopamine levels in the right cerebral cortex and hippocampus in the chronic cerebral hypoperfusion rats, and increased dopamine levels of the cerebral cortex in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injured rat's models. The neurological deficit score was similar between control and AS groups 24 hours after reperfusion, whereas the AS group comprised of ischemia-reperfusion injured rats had a greater percentage of right to left hemisphere area than the control group. In conclusion, AS at the Baihui acupoint for 4 weeks increased dopamine levels in the brain tissue of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion rats and of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injured rats. The AS also reduced brain atrophy after cerebral infarct, suggesting that AS at the Baihui acupoint acts as neuroprotector. However, regular stimulation at the Baihui acupoint enhances cognition and memory functions need further study.

17963313|t|Hwangryunhaedogtang (huanglianjiedutang) treatment for pathological laughter after stroke and importance of patterns identification: a preliminary study.
17963313|a|This study was to test the importance of patterns identification (PI) and the effectiveness of hwangryunhaedogtang (huanglianjiedutang) (HT) treatment for patients with post stroke pathological laughter (PL). Fourteen subjects were enrolled. Eight subjects diagnosed with Yang Excess patterns (YEP) were assigned into group A and 6 subjects who had no YEP to group B. HT was administrated 3 times a day for 14 days to both groups. The duration of PL at one time, the frequency of PL in a day, and pathological laughter scale (PLS) were the primary outcome measures. Barthel index (BI) was the secondary outcome measure. The duration and the frequency of PL in group A were significantly decreased from 10.88 +/- 4.67 to 6.63 +/- 4.07 sec and from 6.38 +/- 2.72 to 3.00 +/- 1.77 times, respectively (p = 0.01) after 14 days administration of HT. PLS in group A was also significantly lowered from 9.13 +/- 1.73 to 4.75 +/- 0.71 points (p = 0.01). However, significant differences were not observed in BI in group A and in the primary and secondary outcome measures in group B. The duration and the frequency of PL and PLS were more markedly reduced in group A than in group B (p = 0.01, 0.02, and < 0.01, respectively). These results suggested that HT could be effective on subjects with post stroke PL diagnosed as YEP and PI, that prescription of herbal medications to such patients should be considered.

17436368|t|Administration of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) reduces apoptosis following myocardial infarction in rat.
17436368|a|Black bear bile has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat liver and eye related illnesses for centuries. A major constituent of bile is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Recent analysis of the cellular effects of UDCA and its taurine conjugate tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) have demonstrated their antiapoptotic properties through regulation of Bcl-2 family and survival signaling proteins (Bax, Bad, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that TUDCA administered to rats prior to a myocardial infarction (MI) would exhibit anti-apoptotic effects and improve cardiac function. Prior to ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, TUDCA (50 mg/ml, 400 mg/kg, IV) or PBS was administered to rats. Animals were sacrificed 24 hours after ligation for terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 activity to assess apoptosis. Additional TUDCA or PBS treated rats underwent pre-operative,1 and 4 week transthoracic ultrasounds to assess heart function by quantification of shortening fraction (SF) and infarct area. TUNEL labeling of the cardiac tissue revealed a significant reduction in apoptotic cells in rats given TUDCA prior to ischemic injury (p = 0.05). In support of reducing apoptosis, caspase-3 activity in the TUDCA treated animals also decreased (p = 0.02). By 4 weeks, a significantly smaller infarct area was present in the TUDCA group compared to the PBS group (0.05 vs. 0.13 cm(2), p = NS) and there was also an improvement in SF. The results provide evidence for TUDCA as a viable treatment for reducing apoptosis in a model of myocardial infarction. Additional studies will distinguish the functional result of improved cell survival following infarction, suggesting the potential for clinical application of this anti-apoptotic drug in treatment of acute MI.

17202656|t|Effects of Anemarrhena asphodeloides on focal ischemic brain injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.
17202656|a|The preventive effect of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge (Liliaceae), a traditional Chinese medicine, on ischemia-reperfusion-induced brain injury was evaluated in the rat brain. Ischemia was induced by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 2 h and reperfusion was continued for 22 h. Water extract of Anemarrhena asphodeloides (WEAA) was orally administered promptly prior to and 2 h after reperfusion. Total infarct volume and edema in the ipsilateral hemispheres of ischemia-reperfusion rats were significantly reduced by treatment with WEAA in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). The therapeutic time window of WEAA was 3 h in this ischemia-reperfusion rat model. WEAA also significantly inhibited increased neutrophil infiltration of ischemic brain tissue as estimated by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and immunohistochemical analysis. MPO-positive cells were markedly reduced by WEAA administration in striatal and cortical areas. These findings suggest that WEAA plays a crucial protective role in ischemia-induced brain injury, and suggest that WEAA could serve as a lead medicinal herb for the development of neuroprotective agents following transient focal ischemic brain injury.

17069775|t|A comparative study on the individual and combined effects of baicalin and jasminoidin on focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.
17069775|a|To compare the individual effects of baicalin and jasminoidin with the combined effect of them on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, and test whether the combined administration of baicalin and jasminoidin can improve the therapeutic effect. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent focal cerebral ischemia for 1.5 h and reperfusion for 24 h. Just before reperfusion, tested drugs (baicalin, jasminoidin, a drug combination consisting of baicalin and jasminoidin, or nimodipine) were intravenously treated. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), behavior examination, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, histological examination, and real-time PCR for BDNF and caspase-3 were performed. All of the drug treatments could significantly ameliorate the results of TTC and histological examination, and the baicalin/jasminoidin combination did so most prominently. This combination could also significantly ameliorate DWI of MRI and behavior examination results, and promote the expression of BDNF and inhibit the expression of caspase-3. On the whole, both baicalin and jasminoidin have a preventive effect against ischemic stroke, although their effects are not very strong. However, the combination of baicalin and jasminoidin can significantly improve their effectiveness. This may be related to its better regulation on the BDNF and caspase-3.

16965752|t|[Effects of Naomaitong Recipe on expressions of nuclear factor-kappaB and nitric-oxide synthases in brain tissue after focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion in aged rats].
16965752|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Naomaitong Recipe, a compound Chinese herbal medicine, on the expressions of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) in brain tissue after focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion in aged rats and the dosage-effect relationship. METHODS: We adopted the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in aged rats as the focal cerebral ischemia model, with 3-hour ischemia and 12-day reperfusion, and observed the changes of the nerve dysfunction score, the water content of cerebral constitution and the expressions of NF-kappaB, heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and NOSs in cerebral cortex. RESULTS: The nerve dysfunction score, the water content of cerebral constitution, the expressions of NF-kappaB, HSP70, neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS), endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in the untreated group were higher than those of the sham-operated group. The nerve dysfunction score, the water content of cerebral constitution, the expressions of NF-kappaB, iNOS and nNOS were lower, while the expressions of HSP70 and eNOS were higher in the high-, medium- and low-dose Naomaitong-treated groups and nimodipine-treated group than those of the untreated-group. The nerve dysfunction score and the expression of nNOS were lower, while the expression of eNOS was higher in the medium-dose Naomaitong-treated group than those of the nimodipine-treated group. The expressions of HSP70 and eNOS were higher, while the other indices were lower in the medium-dose Naomaitong-treated group than those of the low-dose Naomaitong-treated group. CONCLUSION: Naomaitong Recipe can protect the brain cells from damage after focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury by adjusting the expressions of NF-kappaB, HSP70 and NOSs, and the medium-dose Naomaitong Recipe is more effective.

16906331|t|Inflammation of different tissues in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
16906331|a|The hypertension is one of chronic vascular diseases, which often implicates multiple tissues causing stroke, cardiac hypertrophy, and renal failure. A growing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory mechanisms are important participants in the pathophysiology of hypertension. In this study, the inflammatory status of these tissues (kidney, liver, heart, and brain) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was analyzed and its molecular mechanism was explored. The tissues were dissected from SHR and age-matched control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats to investigate the abundance of inflammation-related mediators (IL-1beta, TNFalpha, ICAM-1, iNOS, C/EBPdelta and PPARgamma). mRNA levels were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein expression was evaluated by Western blot. To evaluate the oxidative stress of tissues, carbonyl protein content and total antioxidant capacity of tissues were detected by spectrophotometry and ferric reduction ability power (FRAP) method. The results suggest that: (1) Expressions of inflammation-related mediators (IL-1beta, TNFalpha, ICAM-1, iNOS, C/EBPdelta and PPARgamma) in SHR were higher compared with those in WKY rats except no evident increase of IL-1beta mRNA in liver and brain in SHR. (2) Tissues in SHR contained obviously increased carbonyl protein (nmol/mg protein) compared to that in WKY rats (8.93+/-1.08 vs 2.27+/-0.43 for kidney, 2.23+/-0.23 vs 0.17+/-0.02 for heart, 13.42+/-1.10 vs 5.72+/-1.01 for brain, respectively, P<0.05). However, no evident difference in the amount of carbonyl protein in liver was detected between SHR and WKY rats. (3) Total antioxidant capacities of kidney, liver, heart and brain were markedly lower in SHR than that in WKY rats (P<0.05). Thus, the present data reveal a higher inflammatory status in the important tissues in SHR and indicate that inflammation might play a potential role in pathogenesis of hypertension and secondary organ complications.

16806112|t|Neuroprotective role of Z-ligustilide against forebrain ischemic injury in ICR mice.
16806112|a|Radix Angelica sinensis, known as Danggui in Chinese, has been used to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in Traditional Chinese Medicine for a long time. Modern phytochemical studies showed that Z-ligustilide (LIG) is the main lipophilic component of Danggui. In this study, we examined whether LIG could protect ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury by minimizing oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis. Transient forebrain cerebral ischemia (FCI) was induced by the bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion for 30 min. LIG was intraperitoneally injected to ICR mice at the beginning of reperfusion. As determined via 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 24 h following ischemia, the infarction volume in the FCI mice treated without LIG (22.1 +/- 2.6%) was significantly higher than that in the FCI mice treated with 5 mg/kg (11.8 +/- 5.2%) and 20 mg/kg (2.60 +/- 1.5%) LIG (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). LIG treatment significantly decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activities of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the ischemic brain tissues (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 vs. FCI group). In addition, LIG provided a great increase in Bcl-2 expression as well as a significant decrease in Bax and caspase-3 immunoreactivities in the ischemic cortex. The findings demonstrated that LIG could significantly protect the brain from damage induced by transient forebrain cerebral ischemia. The antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties of LIG may contribute to the neuroprotective potential of LIG in cerebral ischemic damage.

RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the neurological deficit score (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) determined on the 28th and the 90th day after treatment was ameliorated in the treatment group (P < 0.01). Moreover, the 90th day assessment showed that the mortality and severe disability rate was lower (BI < 75) (P <0.05), the complete rehabilitation and mild disability rate (BI > or = 95, P < 0.05), and the sociability rate (Functional Assessment Questionnaire, FAQ) were higher (P < 0.01) in the treatment group than those in the control group. The incidence of adverse reaction was 5.53%, manifested as non-infective diarrhea. CONCLUSION: The ICWM protocol used in this study may improve neural function and quality of life of AICH patients, and reduce the mortality and severe disability rate in those after 90 days' treatment, with only non-infective diarrhea as the adverse reaction.

16458462|t|Paeonol reduced cerebral infarction involving the superoxide anion and microglia activation in ischemia-reperfusion injured rats.
16458462|a|Both Moutan cortex of Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews (MC) and the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall (PL) are important Traditional Chinese herbs used commonly to treat inflammatory and pyretic disorders. Paeonol, a common component of MC causes anti-platelet aggregation and scavenges free radicals. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of Paeonol on cerebral infarct. A total of 60 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were studied. An animal model of cerebral infarct was established by occluding both common carotid arteries and the right middle cerebral artery for 90 min, followed by a 24 h period of reperfusion. The percentage of cerebral infarction area to total brain area in each piece of brain tissue, and neuro-deficit score were measured. Superoxide anion was determined by the number of lucigenin-chemiluminescence (CL) counts. ED1 (mouse anti rat CD68) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) immunostaining in the cerebral infarction region were also investigated for activation of microglia. The results indicated that Paeonol 15 and 20 mg/kg pretreatment and 20 mg posttreatment reduced the cerebral infarction area; Paeonol 15 and 20 mg/kg pretreatment reduced the neuro-deficit score. In addition, Paeonol 20 mg/kg pretreatment reduced the lucigenin-CL counts at 2 h period of reperfusion. The number of ED1 and IL-1beta immunoreactive cells also reduced in the cerebral infarction region; there were no significant changes in blood sugar levels. The results show that Paeonol reduced cerebral infarct and neuro-deficit in rat, suggesting Paeonol might play a similar role in reducing cerebral infarction in humans. Paeonol suppresses and scavenges superoxide anion, and inhibit microglia activation and IL-1beta in ischemia-reperfusion injured rats.

17569335|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effects of Shenqi Fuzheng Injection (SFI) on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injured aged rats. METHODS: Aged SD male rats, weighing 200-300 g, were randomly divided into 4 groups: the model group, the sham-operative group, the nimodipine positive control group (abbreviated as nimodipine group) and the SFI group. Focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injured rat model was established by modified Longa method. SFI was administered by intravenous dripping 1 week before ischemia. Nervous function disorder, brain infarction area, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) levels, brain contents of Ca2+ , water, MDA and SOD levels were observed 3 hrs after ischemia and 3 hrs after reperfusion. RESULTS: perimental results showed that SFI could obviously improve the deficit of nerve function, decrease water content of brain, reduce the infarction area of brain, and inhibit Ca2 + aggregation. LDH and CK levels in serum and MDA in brain were obviously lower than those in the model group and SOD activity in cerebral tissue was obviously higher than that in the model group. CONCLUSION: SFI had protective effect on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injured aged rats, whose mechanism might be related to the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and Ca2+ aggregation.

16682544|t|Venturi mask adjuvant oxygen therapy in severe acute ischemic stroke.
16682544|a|BACKGROUND: The effect of oxygen therapy in acute ischemic stroke remains undetermined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of eubaric hyperoxia therapy by Venturi mask (VM) in a group of patients who experienced a severe acute ischemic stroke. DESIGN: Patients experiencing a first-ever large middle cerebral artery infarction were recruited within 48 hours after stroke. Patients were subdivided to undergo therapy with a VM with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40% or with a nasal cannula. A large middle cerebral artery infarction was defined as a large low-attenuation area of more than one third of the middle cerebral artery territory on brain images. Stroke severity was evaluated by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled in the VM group and 29 in the nasal cannula group. All the demographic and clinical characteristics were equally distributed initially. The mean initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 20.5 and 18.9 in the VM and nasal cannula groups, respectively. Atrial fibrillation was found in 11 (65%) patients in the VM and 17 (59%) patients in the nasal cannula groups. The VM therapy was initiated within 13.7 (range, 3.0-41.5) hours after stroke and the duration was 132.9 (range, 48.0-168.5) hours. In-hospital mortality was 1 (6%) in the VM group and 7 (24%) in the nasal cannula group (P=.12). In the VM group, there were fewer incidences of fever (4 [24%] vs 15 [52%]; P=.06), pneumonia (1 [6%] vs 6 [21%]; P=.18), and respiratory failure (3 [18%] vs 8 [28%]; P=.45), but a higher incidence of bedsores (3 [18%] vs 2 [7%]; P=.29). CONCLUSIONS: By using VM therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%, there might be less mortality and comorbidities in treated patients who experienced a severe acute ischemic stroke. Further randomized confirmatory studies should explore the decreased mortality in patients who experience a severe acute ischemic stroke, especially in those with a large middle cerebral artery infarction who undergo VM therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%.

16700989|t|[Establishment and evaluation of reproduction of middle cerebral artery occlusion to produce cerebral ischemia with autologous blood clot and nylon thread in rat].
16700989|a|OBJECTIVE: To reproduce cerebral ischemia using middle cerebral artery, occlusion (MCAO) method with autologous blood clot and nylon thread in rat. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into sham operation group (n=10), suture occlusion group (n=12), thrombus suture occlusion model group (n=12) in which both autologous blood clot and nylon thread were used (thrombus occluded group). Cerebral ischemia as a result of MCAO in suture occlusion group was replicated by insertion of nylon thread. In thrombus occluded group, a polyethylene catheter containing a nylon thread was inserted into the middle carotid artery via external carotid artery, and the nylon thread was pulled out to an appropriate length to allow blood to coagulate. Fifteen minutes later, thrombin was injected, and the nylon thread was re-inserted to complete MCAO. Specimens were taken after ischemia for 6 hours. Neurological symptoms were observed, brain water ratio and the cerebral infarction size were measured, and the pathological changes in the brain tissue were observed. RESULTS: Compared with sham operation group, the evaluation score of neurological symptoms was significantly higher, and water content and cerebral infarction size were larger in suture occlusion group and thrombus occluded group (all P<0.01); the pathological changes of the brain were also more marked. Compared with suture occlusion group, thrombus occlusion group showed no differences in evaluation score, water content, cerebral infarction size and pathological changes of the brain (all >0.05). CONCLUSION: In rats, occlusion of middle cerebral artery with autologous blood clot and inserted nylon thread can result in the functional lesion, edema and the pathological changes in the brain. The MCAO reproduced by this method could produce thrombotic obstruction of the middle cerebral artery for the experimental study of cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury, and it could prevent hemorrhage in the process of replication of animal model and in the course of thrombolysis therapy in the clinic. The model has the advantages of precision of the occlusion site, production of constant cerebral infarction size, easier performance and good repeatability.

16455305|t|Insights from molecular investigations of traditional Chinese herbal stroke medicines: implications for neuroprotective epilepsy therapy.
16455305|a|Traditional Chinese herbal medicine is the most widely practiced form of herbalism worldwide. It is based on a sophisticated system of medical theory and practice that is distinctly different from orthodox Western scientific medicine. Most traditional therapeutic formulations consist of a combination of several drugs. The combination of multiple drugs is thought to maximize therapeutic efficacy by facilitating synergistic actions and ameliorating or preventing potential adverse effects while at the same time aiming at multiple targets. Orthodox drug therapy has been subject to critical analysis by the "evidence-based medicine" movement, and demands have been made that herbal medicine should be subject to the same kind of scrutiny. However, evaluation of the effectiveness of herbal medicines can be challenging, as their active components are often not known. Accordingly, it may be difficult to ensure that an herbal preparation used in clinical trials contains the components underlying its purported therapeutic effect. We reasoned that the identification of actions of herbal medicines at well-defined molecular targets and subsequent identification of chemical compounds underlying these molecular effects might serve as surrogate markers in the hypothesis-guided evaluation of their therapeutic efficacy. A research program was initiated to characterize in vitro molecular actions of a collection of 58 traditional Chinese drugs that are often used for the treatment of stroke. The results indicate that these drugs possess activity at disparate molecular targets in the signaling pathways involved in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated neuronal injury and death. Each herbal drug contains diverse families of chemical compounds, where each family comprises structurally related members that act with low affinity at multiple molecular targets. The data appear to support the multicomponent, multitarget approach of traditional Chinese medicine. Glutamate release and excessive stimulation of NMDA receptors cause status epilepticus-induced neuronal death and are involved in epileptogenesis. Therefore, these results are also relevant to the development of antiepileptogenic and neuroprotective therapy for seizures. The combination of principles of modern molecular medicine with certain ideas of traditional empirical Chinese medicine may be beneficial in translational medicine in general.

16503526|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of Buyanghuanwu decoction (BYHWD) in inducing nerve proliferation in rats with sequelae of ischemic stroke. METHODS: A rat model of ischemic stroke sequelae was established by means of craniectomy in which the right common carotid artery was ligated with 4-0 silk thread followed by cauterization of the right middle cerebral artery. Programmed electric shock was administered 24 h after the onset of ischemic stroke for 2 h daily for 20 consecutive days. The rats in sham operation group were not subjected to ligation of the right common carotid artery or right middle cerebral artery occlusion. The rats in the treatment groups were given oral BYHWD for 15 consecutive days. All the rats received repeated intraperitoneal injections of the cell proliferation-specific marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and the intake of BrdU in the cerebral tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The number of BrdU-immunoreactive cells in the cerebral tissues of BYHWD-treated rats was significantly greater than that in the untreated model group. CONCLUSION: BYHWD can promote nerve proliferation in rats with ischemic stroke sequelae.

16236447|t|Acupuncture prevents cognitive deficits and oxidative stress in cerebral multi-infarction rats.
16236447|a|The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of acupuncture on cognitive deficits and oxidative stress in cerebral multi-infarction rats. The results showed that acupunctural treatment attenuated memory impairment induced by cerebral multi-infarction, as evaluated by shortened escape latency and increased swimming time of rats with memory impairment in the target quadrant. The data additionally suggested that acupunctural treatment ameliorated oxidative injuries induced by cerebral multi-infarction by increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the hippocampus. Further investigation by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that acupunctural treatment significantly increased the expression of CuZnSOD mRNA and protein in the hippocampus of the impaired rats. The findings demonstrate that acupuncture can exert beneficial effects on spatial memory and antioxidant status of cerebral multi-infarction rats.

16883630|t|Prevention of cerebral oxidative injury by post-ischemic intravenous administration of Shengmai San.
16883630|a|Shengmai San (SMS) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) comprising three different herbal components, Panax ginseng, Ohiopogon japonicus and Fructus schisandrae and has been used for treating coronary heart diseases (Bensky and Barolet, 1990). It was shown that SMS effectively prevented cerebral oxidative injury in rats when it administered into the duodenum before cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. In the present study, we examined whether post-ischemic administration of SMS can ameliorate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats as well. Results showed that SMS injected immediately after ischemia also prevented the ischemia-reperfusion injury, when the effect was evaluated by the formation of protein carbonyl and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and the loss of glutathione peroxidase (GPX). The preventative potential of SMS was decreased rapidly dependent on the time lag until SMS was injected after ischemia. However, it was noted that intravenously administered SMS protected the oxidative injury approximately 30% even after 60 min of reperfusion in terms of protein carbonyl formation. It is thus suggested that SMS injection might be useful for preventing the progression of injury in cerebral infarction after stroke.

16360928|t|Traditional Chinese medicines with caspase-inhibitory activity.
16360928|a|Clinical evidence indicates that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) drugs can reduce stroke-inflicted brain damage. To date, the molecular basis of the apparent neuroprotective effects of these TCM drugs remains largely obscure. Several lines of evidence indicate that the activation of cell death programs leads to the loss of neurons during the reperfusion phase of ischemic stroke. In particular, activation of caspases (cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinases) is a critical step in neuronal apoptosis. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence assays, we screened a collection of 58 TCM drugs that are commonly used in stroke therapy for caspase inhibitory activity. We found that aqueous extracts of Lianqiao (Fructus Forsythiae) and Shouwuteng (Caulis Polygoni multiflori) blocked the activity of the initiator caspase-8 as well as the effector caspase-3 and caspase-7 in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50)10 microg/ml. Identification of caspase inhibitory activity of these TCM drugs, allows the formulation of testable hypotheses and design of further investigations aimed at the elucidation of the molecular basis of TCM stroke therapy.

16344019|t|Acupuncture for upper-extremity rehabilitation in chronic stroke: a randomized sham-controlled study.
16344019|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of traditional Chinese acupuncture with sham acupuncture on upper-extremity (UE) function and quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic hemiparesis from stroke. DESIGN: A prospective, sham-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT). SETTING: Patients recruited through a hospital stroke rehabilitation program. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three subjects who incurred a stroke 0.8 to 24 years previously and had moderate to severe UE functional impairment. INTERVENTIONS: Active acupuncture tailored to traditional Chinese medicine diagnoses, including electroacupuncture, or sham acupuncture. Up to 20 treatment sessions (mean, 16.9) over a mean of 10.5 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: UE motor function, spasticity, grip strength, range of motion (ROM), activities of daily living, QOL, and mood. All outcomes were measured at baseline and after treatment. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses found no statistically significant differences in outcomes between active and sham acupuncture groups. Analyses of protocol-compliant subjects revealed significant improvement in wrist spasticity (P<.01) and both wrist (P<.01) and shoulder (P<.01) ROM in the active acupuncture group, and improvement trends in UE motor function (P=.09) and digit ROM (P=.06). CONCLUSIONS: Based on ITT analyses, we conclude that acupuncture does not improve UE function or QOL in patients with chronic stroke symptoms. However, gains in UE function observed in protocol-compliant subjects suggest traditional Chinese acupuncture may help patients with chronic stroke symptoms. These results must be interpreted cautiously because of small sample sizes and multiple, unadjusted, post hoc comparisons. A larger, more definitive RCT using a similar design is feasible and warranted.

16291709|t|Danshen: an overview of its chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical use.
16291709|a|Danshen, the dried root of Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been widely used in China and, to a lesser extent, in Japan, the United States, and other European countries for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

The current review covers its traditional uses, chemical constituents, pharmacological activities, pharmacokinetics, clinical applications, and potential herb-drug interactions based on information obtained in both the English and Chinese literature. Although numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that certain Danshen products in China are effective and safe for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, most of these lack sufficient quality. Therefore, large randomized clinical trials and further scientific research to determine its mechanism of actions will be necessary to ensure the safety, effectiveness, and better understanding of its action.

16447661|t|The brain-resuscitation acupuncture method for treatment of post wind-stroke mental depression--a report of 45 cases.
16447661|a|In order to observe the therapeutic effects of the brain-resuscitation acupuncture method for post wind-stroke mental depression, 90 such cases were randomly divided into two groups, each consisting of 45 cases. For the treatment group, the brain-resuscitation acupuncture method was adopted, with Neiguan (PC 6), Renzhong (GV 26), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Baihui (GV 20), and Shenmen (HT 7) selected as the main points. For the control group, oral medication of Fluoxetine was prescribed. Therapeutic effects and changes in the HAMD integrals of the two groups were observed. The total effective rate in the treatment group was 77.7%, and that in the control group was 75.1%, showing no significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). The average effect starting time of the treatment group was 11.58 +/- 4.89 days, while that of the control group was 15.96 +/- 6.50 days, showing a significant difference between the two groups (P<0.05). It can be concluded that for the post wind-stroke mental depression, the brain-resuscitation acupuncture method may show a good and quicker therapeutic effect with no side effects as compared with pharmacotherapy.

16181648|t|Acupuncture improved cognitive impairment caused by multi-infarct dementia in rats.
16181648|a|Recent studies have demonstrated that acupuncture is feasible to treat vascular dementia (VD). The aim of this study was to present behavioral evidence that acupuncture could improve the learning and memory of multi-infarct dementia rats. The pattern of multi-infarct dementia in rats was made by injecting homogeneous emboli into the internal carotid artery. Of them the rats which showed damage in learning and memory (n = 43) were randomly allocated to 3 groups: impaired group (n = 14), acupuncture group (n = 15) and placebo-acupuncture group (n = 14). Moreover, normal group (n = 15) and sham-operated group (n = 15) were set as control groups. The acupuncture group was given acupuncture, which consisted of Tanzhong (CV17), Zhongwan (CV12), Qihai (CV6), Zusanli (ST36) and Xuehai (SP10). Morris water maze test was employed to assess spatial discriminational ability per group respectively and to analyze the curative effects of acupuncture. Compared to the impaired and placebo-acupuncture groups, no cognition impairment was found in the normal and sham-operated groups, and the statistic analysis showed that there were significant differences between normal and impaired groups in ANOVA. Shortened mean escape latency was detected in the acupuncture group compared with the impaired group during the same trial days. Search strategy changed from random pattern adopted by impaired and placebo-acupuncture rats to tendency or linear pattern popular in normal group. The present results suggested that the acupuncture exerted a protective effect on cognitive impairment caused by cerebral multi-infarction in rats, and acupuncture has a specificity of cure. Acupuncture as a potential clinic method in treating VD should be developed and investigated in the future.

16181534|a|OBJECTIVE: A new rat model of cerebral infarction was developed to elucidate the contribution of vascular endothelial cell during focal cerebral infarction formation. METHODS: Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the model group, sham operation group, and control group for indexes observation of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) dyeing, neurological deficit, plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity, thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) content, and 6-keto-prostaglandin (6-keto-PGF(1alpha)) content. RESULTS: (1) The highest neurological score appeared at 6 h after operation, descending significantly at sequential time. (2) Using TTC dyeing and optical microscope technique, pathological changes in brains were observed. (3) Compared with control group and sham operation groups, there was a decrease in tPA activity of model rats at the initial 12 h after injection of sodium laurate (P < 0.05), PAI activity decreased markedly in the model group at 24 h after injection of sodium laurate. (4) In plasma TXB(2) concentration reached the highest level compared at 6 h after injection of sodium laurate, but there were not obvious differences in plasma 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) concentration among all groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Focal cerebral infarction in rats could be induced by some sodium laurate, showing ischemic cerebrum necrosis, function disorder of vascular endothelium-platelet, fibrinolysis abnormality. This model could play an important role in researching the contribution of vascular endothelial cell during cerebral infarction development, preventing and curing by traditional Chinese medicine.

15920455|t|The 825C/T polymorphism of G-protein beta3 subunit gene and risk of ischaemic stroke.
15920455|a|In this study, we investigated the association of G protein beta3 subunit gene (GNB 3) C825T polymorphism with ischaemic stroke and its subtypes in the Chinese Han population in a large case-control study. A total of 990 ischemic stroke patients and 1124 controls were recruited from six medical centres in China. Genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent risk factors for stroke. The frequency of 825T carriers is significantly higher in cerebral thrombosis in male subjects (OR=1.35, 95% CI, 1.01-1.82, P=0.046). After further adjustment with traditional risk factors to stroke, the association is not significant. In conclusion, the GNB3 825T allele is not an independent risk factor to ischaemic stroke in the Chinese population.

16005837|a|This study was designed to survey college students about their knowledge and use of Uwhangchungsimwon (UC), a Traditional Oriental herbal remedy for emergency and acute treatment of stroke, numbness, hypertension, epilepsy and arteriosclerosis. Students at three female nursing colleges in Korea completed a questionnaire containing 29 questions about the students' demographics, knowledge and use of UC, and the placebo effect. Of 608 respondents, 217 (36%) had taken UC. Eighty-three per cent reported that UC alleviated examination tension and 28% knew that it is used as an emergency drug for stroke. Forty-two per cent believed that UC has a "placebo effect" and 20% considered its effects were more than that of a placebo. Fifty-eight per cent of those using UC felt that it was effective in inducing psychological relaxation, 4% considered that it increased their energy levels, and 6% felt it was effective in "clearing the head"; 33% reported no effects. Users also reported adverse effects: 30% reported drowsiness, 17% reported a "heavy head" and 15% experienced indigestion. Most respondents (73%) obtained information about UC from family members and friends and 33% from newspapers or the media. These results confirm health practitioner should recognize that UC is used widely for purposes other than its intended purpose (i.e., to treat stroke and hypertension) and that such use can cause adverse effects. More systematic research is needed to increase the safety of consumers when using herbs and herbal supplements.

16161429|t|[The effect of Hongjingtian (Gadol) injection on cardiac hemodynamics and myocardial oxygen consumption of dogs].
16161429|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Hongjingtian (Gadol) injection on cardiac hemodynamics and myocardial oxygen consumption for analyzing its underlying mechanism in the treatment of coronary heart disease. METHOD: A total of 20 dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg x kg(-1), i.v.) were evenly randomized into control group, low-dose Gadol (LDG) group, high-dose Gadol (HDG) group and Herbesser Injection group. The blood flow volume (BFV) of the left coronary artery and cardiac output (CO), left ventricular pressure (LVP), maximum ascending rate (dp/dtmax) of LVP, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the femoral artery, oxygen contents of the coronary artery and coronary vein (venous sinus), oxygen consumption index (OCI), cardiac index (CI), coronary artery resistance (CAR) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) as well as oxygen utilization rate (OUR) were detected respectively. RESULT: After venous injection of Gadol, CAR, MAP, TPR, OCI, myocardial oxygen consumption and heart rate lowered significantly (P < 0.05-0.01), while BFV and blood oxygen content of the venous sinus increased considerably (P < 0.05-0.01) in comparison with pre-injection. No significant differences were found in LVP and myocardial contractivity between control group and LDG, and between control and HDG groups respectively. CONCLUSION: It showed dilation of the coronary artery and reduction of the cardiac afterload after injection of Gadol. Besides, CO and stroke volume increased considerably and the cardiac effective work was raised without any significant simultaneous increase of both myocardial contractility and LVP. A decrease in the myocardial oxygen consumption and reduction of OCI indicates an improvement of the oxygen supply of the myocardium, and a favorable regulation of the compliance of the cardiac vessels. As a result, the cardiovascular performance was ameliorated. The abovementioned improvement of these indexes may contribute to the therapeutic effect of Gadol in the treatment of coronary heart disease in clinic.

15932703|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effects of Tongxinluo on myocardium and microvasculature after reperfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: The research was performed on the patients with AMI whose initial ECG showed ST segment elevation and the patients received PCI or thrombolysis immediately after onset. These patients were classified randomly into two groups: control group in which the patients were given routine drug treatment (52 cases) and treatment group in which the patients were given routine drug plus Tongxinluo capsule (60 cases). We observed the abnormal movement of the ventricle wall in 2DE, and the change in LVEDV or LVEF on the 1st day, 7th day, 13th day, 3rd month, and 6th month after onset, which were compared with the result of DISA and SPECT for myocardial image. At the same time we also examined the blood NO and MDA levels on the 1st day, the 7th day and 13th day. RESULTS: (1) The recover rate for the abnormal movement of the ventricle segments in the treatment group were 11.86%, 18.12% and 18.79% respectively, which were higher than that of the control group (4.13%, 8.27% and 11.11% respectively) on the 1st week, the 2nd week, and the 1st month. At the 6th month the total recover rate for the abnormal movement of the ventricle segments of Tongxinluo group was 70.03%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (51.68%). The WMSI was also decreased more than that of the control group. (2) The LVEDV in Tongxinluo group increased by 9.42% one week after onset, which was close to that of the control group (9.59%). There was no significant change (9.40% and 9.42% respectively) after two weeks and one month in Tongxinluo group, whereas it was increased continuously in the control group (11.84% and 12.33%). LVEDV in Tongxinluo group was decrease obviously after three and six months (3.62% and 5.07% respectively), which was close to the original level, whereas the result of the control group remained on a higher level (13.70% and 11.72% respectively). (3) LVEF of the Tongxinluo group was 53.32% before treatment, which was comparable with that of the control group (P = 0.45). There was no significant difference between the two groups after treatment for 1 week, 2 week and 1 month (P = 0.11, P = 0.13, P = 0.18, respectively). LVEF for the two groups was 58.27% and 53.40% respectively after three months and there was a statistical significance (P < 0.01). LVEF for the two groups was 58.33% and 53.82% respectively after 6 months and the difference remained statistically significant (P < 0.05). (4) The 2DE WMSI for the Tongxinluo group was 1.7552 after 12 hours to 24 hours of the CVR and there was no significant difference compared with that of the control group (WMSI = 1.5380, P = 0.6945). After 6 months, the WMSI decreased to 1.3767 in the Tongxinluo group, which was statistically different from that of the control group (WMSI = 1.5380, P < 0.01). The myocardium acquire isotope score index of the Tongxinluo group was 0.6075 at 6 months, which was significantly different from that of the control group (0.8781). (5) Ultrasonic humerus artery examination in static status showed that there was no significant difference on the diameter of blood vessel and the speed of blood stream between Tongxinluo group and control group with. The diameter of the blood vessel after artery pressure in Tongxinluo group was expanded, which was significantly different from that in the static status (P < 0.001) and that in control group (P < 0.001). The diameter of blood vessel after administration of nitroglycerin in both groups was expanded, which was significantly different from that in the static status (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05). However, Tongxinluo group was expand more obviously than that of the control group (P < 0.05). (6) The MDA level of the Tongxinluo group was decreased (all P < 0.05) and the NO level was increased (all P < 0.05) gradually from the 1st week to the 4th week; however, the MDA level of the control group was not decreased until the 4th week (P < 0.05), and the NO level of the control group was increased evidently at the 2nd week (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: (1) After reperfusion in AMI patients, administration of routine drug combined with Tongxinluo is more effective than routine drug alone in the reduction of infarction size. (2) In Tongxinluo group, the recover time and the total recover rate of the abnormal movement of the ventricle segments were higher than the control group, and the WMSI were significantly decreased than the control group. (3) The improvement degree and the recover time on LVEDV in Tongxinluo group was superior to control group. (4) The improvement of LVEF in time and in degree was superior to control group. (5) The blood concentration of the MDA was decreased significantly in Tongxinluo group, while the NO level was increased significantly, and the time was superior to control group significantly.

15715926|t|Gene expression profile induced by oral administration of baicalin and gardenin after focal brain ischemia in rats.
15715926|a|AIM: To investigate differential gene expression and the pharmacological mechanism of baicalin and gardenin in focal cerebral ischemia in rats with high-density cDNA microarray. METHODS: Rat left middle cerebral arteries were occluded and treated with either baicalin or gardenin. The pharmacological effects were investigated using the difference in infarction areas before and after treatment, which were determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Gene expression was demonstrated using a "Biostar40S" gene microarray. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the result of the selected genes. RESULTS: Both baicalin and gardenin reduced the infarction areas in focal cerebral ischemia rats (P<0.05). The differential genes were 211, 177, and 70 (upregulated or downregulated) in the model group, baicalin, and gardenin treatment groups compared with the sham-operated group, respectively. Gene expression of RpL19 and Csnk2 underwent an approximately 1.9 and 2.1-fold increase, respectively, verified by semiquantitative RT-PCR, which was the same trend as the cDNA microarray. CONCLUSION: Differential gene expression with respect to the pharmacological effects of baicalin and gardenin on focal cerebral ischemia by cDNA microarray revealed a number of clues with respect to the therapeutic mechanisms of Chinese traditional medicine. In addition, the present study provided theoretical and experimental evidence that will aid future studies examining cerebral ischemia.

15830837|t|Magnesium as NMDA receptor blocker in the traditional Chinese medicine Danshen.
15830837|a|Aqueous extracts of the traditional Chinese medicine Danshen, the dried roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Labiatae), blocked N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) evoked currents in cerebrocortical neurons in vitro. The block of the NMDA-evoked currents was voltage dependent and showed the negative slope conductance reminiscent of the effect of Mg2+ ions. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) revealed that aqueous Danshen extracts contained approximately 9mM magnesium. Fractionation of the extracts by high performance liquid chromatography followed by patch clamp recording and AAS indicated that magnesium ions were present in two distinct fractions. One fraction contained approximately 5 mM magnesium and blocked NMDA-induced currents indicating that it contained mostly free Mg2+ ions, while a second fraction did not possess NMDA antagonist activity despite the presence of approximately 4 mM magnesium suggesting that Mg2+ in this fraction was mostly chelated. Following removal of the free Mg2+ by ion exchange chromatography, the previously observed block of the NMDA-induced currents was abolished. These data demonstrate that Danshen contains both free and chelated Mg2+. Free Mg2+ ions account for the NMDA antagonist activity of Danshen in vitro.

15763061|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of low-level laser irradiation on acupuncture points combined with iontophoresis against brain damage after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. METHODS: Sixty-nine SD rats were randomly divided into five groups, including normal group, sham operation group, model group, electro-acupuncture group and low-level laser irradiation on acupuncture points combined with iontophoresis group (LLLI group). The cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model was established by thread embolism of middle cerebral artery. The rats in the LLLI group, as well as the electro-acupuncture group were given treatment as soon as the occlusion finished (0 hour) and 12, 24 hours after the occlusion. We observed the changes of neurological deficit scores and the body weight of the rats at different time. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the ratos brain tissue were tested. RESULTS: The neurological deficit score of the LLLI group was significantly lower than that of the model group. The body weight and the activity of SOD of the rats decreased slightly, and the content of MDA decreased significantly after the treatment. CONCLUSION: The low-level laser irradiation on acupuncture points combined with iontophoresis can prevent focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. One of its mechanisms may be increasing the activity of SOD and decreasing the damage of the oxidation products to the body.

15842143|t|[Study on correlationship of TCM syndrome type and expression of ICAM-1, CD62P in patients with ischemic stroke].
15842143|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the correlationship between TCM Syndrome type with changes of neutrophil surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and platelet membrane P selectin (CD62P) in patients with ischemic stroke for exploring the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Seventy-two patients with ischemic stroke were dividcd into 3 typing groups according to TCM syndrome-differentiation, the Meridian-phlegm stagnancy group (MPS), the visceral phlegm-heat accumulation group (VPHA) and the qi-deficiency with blood stasis group (QDBS), 24 in each group. Besides, a control group consisted of 24 healthy subjects was set up. Blood levels of ICAM-1 and CDP62 expression were monitored by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Blood levels of ICAM-1 and CD62P expression in ischemic stroke patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects (P < 0.01). Among the three type groups, ICAM-1 expression was significantly higher in MPS than that in the VPHA and the QDBS group (P<0.01), and CD62P expression in the MPS and the QDBS group was significantly higher than that in the VPHA (P <0.01). CONCLUSION: Blood levels of ICAM-1 and CD62P expression in different typing of patients with ischemic stroke are different. ICAM-1 expression reflects the pathological state of phlegm retention or phlegm-stasis mutual bindings, CD62P expression reflected the blood stasis state in organism, these evidences suggest that MPS may be the key pathogenic factor of ischemic stroke.

15699577|t|Chinese herbal medicine, Shengmai San, is effective for improving circulatory shock and oxidative damage in the brain during heatstroke.
15699577|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Shengmai San (SMS), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on heatstroke-induced circulatory shock and oxidative damage in the brain in rats. Anesthetized rats were exposed to a high ambient temperature (43 degrees C) to induce heatstroke. After the onset of heatstroke, the values of mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral blood flow, and brain partial pressure of O(2) were all significantly lower than those in normothermic controls. However, the values of intracranial pressure, brain and colonic temperatures, and brain levels of free radicals, lipid peroxidation, and cellular ischemia and damage markers were all greater in heatstroke rats compared with those of normothermic controls. Pretreatment or post-treatment with SMS significantly reduced the hypotension, intracranial hypertension, cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia and increased levels of ischemia and damage markers in the brain during heatstroke. The protective effects exerted by SMS pretreatment is superior to those of SMS post-treatment. The results demonstrate that SMS is effective for prevention and repair of circulatory shock and ischemic and oxidative damage in the brain during heatstroke.

16047560|t|Microglia, apoptosis and interleukin-1beta expression in the effect of sophora japonica l. on cerebral infarct induced by ischemia-reperfusion in rats.
16047560|a|Sophora Japonica L. (SJ) is a traditional Chinese herb used to cool blood, stop bleeding and to treat hemorrhoids with bleeding. Although several recent studies found that both SJ and Ginkgo biloba have the same components of quercetin and rutin, only Ginkgo biloba has been widely used to treat cerebrovascular disorders and dementia in humans. This study investigated the effect of SJ on cerebral infarct in rats. A total of 66 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were studied. Focal cerebral infarct was established by occluding the bilateral common carotid arteries and the right middle cerebral artery for 90 minutes. After 24 hours of reperfusion, the neurological status was evaluated. The rats were then killed, and brain tissue was stained with 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride. The grading scale of neurological deficit and the ratio of cerebral infarction area were used as an index to evaluate the effect of SJ on cerebral infarct. In addition, the number of ED1 and interleukin-1beta immunostaining positive cells, and apoptotic cells were measured in the cerebral infarction zone. The results indicated that pre-treatment with 100 or 200 mg/kg SJ and post-treatment with 200 mg/kg SJ significantly reduced the grade of neurological deficit and the ratio of cerebral infarction area. In addition, pre-treatment with 200 mg/kg SJ also significantly reduced ED1 and interleukin-1beta immunostaining positive cells, and apoptotic cells in ischemia-reperfusion cerebral infarct rats. This study demonstrated that SJ could reduce the cerebral infarction area and neurological deficit induced by ischemia-reperfusion in rats, suggesting its potential as a treatment for cerebral infarct in humans. This effect of SJ involves its suppressive action of microglia, interleukin-1beta and apoptosis.

16435585|t|Effect of Danchunwhangagam on LPS or DFX-induced cytokine production in peripheral mononuclear cells of cerebral infarction patients.
16435585|a|The Danchunwhangagam (DCWGG) has long been used for various cerebrovascular diseases. However, little scientific investigation has been carried out. Cytokines involved in the regulation of inflammatory reactions and immune responses may play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction (CI). The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of DCWGG on the production of proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CI patients. The amount of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 in PBMC culture supernatant was significantly increased in the lipopolysaccaride (LPS)- or desferrioxamine (DFX)-treated cells compared with unstimulated cells. We showed that DCWGG inhibited the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta IL-6, and IL-8 induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Also, DCWGG inhibited TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-beta, IL-6, and IL-8 production-induced DFX in dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that DCWGG might have regulatory effects on LPS- or DFX-induced cytokine production, which might explain its beneficial effect in the treatment of CI.

15769421|a|Research works were done on origin and development of the denomination, the acute stage of etiopathogenisis and pathogenesis, therapeutical priniciple and therapeutical methods in hemorrhagic stroke. Stroke was divided into is chemic and hemorrhagic until the end of the Qing dynasty. In 1997, Terminology of Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment-Disease Part of National Standard formally included the term hemorrhagic stroke. Before 1950s-1960s, the pathogenesis emphasizes the up-stirring of liver, the adverse-rising of both blood and qi. A proper remedy should to subdue the liver yang, calm down the endopathic wind and clear heat. Since 1970s, it has been considered that the disorder is closely related with the spleen and stomach. The focal pathogenesis was blocked passage of the middle jiao, disorder of qi in ascending and descending and the abnormal flow of qi and blood. Since 1980s, it was claimed that hemorrhagic stroke belongs to blood syndrome of TCM. The vital pathogenesis was accumulation of blood stasis in acute stage of hemorrhagic stroke. The key point of therapeutical method was to promote blood circulation to remove blood stasis. In recent years, the theories of endogenous toxic factor, consumption, yin and yang syndrome, and the therapeutical method of antidote, assisting the vital qi, especially the development of common therapeutical methods were developed, with an abundance of differential diagnosis and treatment in hemorrhagic stroke.

15531085|t|Tetramethylpyrazine reduces ischemic brain injury in rats.
15531085|a|Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), which is widely used in the treatment of ischemic stroke by Chinese herbalists, is one of the most important active ingredients of the traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Ligusticum wallichii Franchat (Chung Xiong). However, the mechanism by which TMP protects the brain is still not clear. We examined neuroprotective effects of TMP after transient focal cerebral ischemia using common carotid artery and middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats and evaluated the involvement of anti-inflammation. TMP administrated intraperitoneally significantly protected the brain against ischemic insult as evidenced by the reduction in infarction volume, preservation of neurons, and decrease in brain edema. TMP markedly reduced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced inflammatory cell activation and proinflammatory mediator production. Moreover, TMP suppressed lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma-induced inflammation and prostaglandin E(2) production in cultured glial cells. Our findings suggest that one of neuroprotective effects of TMP against ischemic brain injury might involve its anti-inflammatory potential.

15553816|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between TCM Syndromes types, Xin-qi deficiency (XQD) and Xin-yang deficiency (XYD), and contents of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta and IL-10 in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: Sixty-seven CHF in-patients with Xin-qi deficiency or Xin-yang deficiency syndrome were enrolled, their NYHA (New York Heart Association) cardiac function was assessed, ejection fraction (EF) and E peak/A peak (E/A) ratio were determined by Doppler ultrasonic echocardiograph, and serum TNF-alpha, II-6, IL-1beta and IL-10 were measured by double antibody sandwich ELISA assay. RESULTS: The cardiac function grading in patients of XQD was mostly of I and II grade, while that in patients of XYD was mostly of III and IV grade (by Ridit analysis, P<0.01). The E/A and EF values were higher in patients of XQD than those in patients of XYD (P<0.01). Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta were higher and IL-10 was lower in patients of XYD than those in patients of XQD (P<0.05 or P<0.01) respectively. CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta and IL-10 probably play an important role in the development process of XQD to XYD, and could be taken as the microcosmic indexes for differentiation of the two syndromes.

15553815|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between the TCM Syndrome Differentiation-types of congestive heart failure (CHF) and thyroid hormones, including triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), as well as cardiac function parameters, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), mean velocity of circumferentid fiber shortening (mVcf) and A peak/E peak (A/E). METHODS: One hundred patients with CHF were divided into 4 Syndrome Differentiation-type groups, their cardiac function parameters, ANP and thyroid hormones were determined and compared with those in the 23 subjects in the control group. RESULTS: In CHF patients with edema and blood stasis Syndrome type, the level of plasma ANP was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05); level of T3 was significantly lower than that in the control group and in CHF patients of other three (Xin-qi deficiency, Yin-deficiency and blood stasis) Syndrome groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01); levels of LVEF and mVcf were significantly lower than those in the other three Syndrome groups (all P < 0.01). Level of T4 in other three Syndrome groups significantly increased than that in the edema and blood stasis Syndrome type. A/E value showed a higher level in patients of all TCM type than that in the control (P < 0.01). Correlation analysis showed that T3 was positively correlated with LVEF and T4 (r = 0.200, P < 0.05, and r = 0.293, P < 0.01), and negatively correlated with ANP (r = -0.263, P < 0.01); T4 was negatively correlated with A/E (r = -0.226, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The lowering of T3 and T4 and increasing of ANP may be one of the important reasons for lowering of LVEF in CHF patients with edema and blood stasis Syndrome-type. The decrease of T4 may be one of the important reasons for elevation of A/E and aggravation of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in CHF patients of all the 4 TCM Syndrome-types.

15377426|t|Activation of endogenous neural stem cells in experimental intracerebral hemorrhagic rat brains.
15377426|a|BACKGROUND: Many researchers suggest that adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is incapable of completing self-repair or regeneration. And there are accumulating lines of evidence which suggest that endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) are activated in many pathological conditions, including stroke in the past decades, which might partly account for rehabilitation afterwards. In this study, we investigated whether there was endogenous neural stem cell activation in intracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) rat brains. METHODS: After ICH induction by stereotactical injection of collagenase type VII into globus pallidus, 5-Bromo-2 Deoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered intraperitoneally to label newborn cells. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect Nestin, a marker for neural stem cells, and BrdU. RESULTS: Nestin-positive or BrdU-Labeled cells were predominantly located at 2 sites: basal ganglion around hemotoma, ependyma and nearby subventricular zone (SVZ). No positive cells for the 2 markers were found in the 2 sites of normal control group and sham group, as well as in non-leisioned parenchyma, both hippocampi and olfactory bulbs in the 4 groups. Nestin+ cells presented 4 types of morphology, and BrdU+ nucleus were polymorphologic. Positive cell counting around hemotoma showed that at day 2, Nestin+ cells were seen around hemotoma in model group, the number of which increased at day 4, day 7 (P <0.01), peaked at day 14 (P <0.05), and reduced significantly by day 28 (P <0.01). CONCLUSION: Endogenous neural stem cells were activated in experimental intracerebral hemorrhagic rat brains.

15339408|t|[Effect of Baisuifang Granule on cognitive malfunction after cerebral infarction].
15339408|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of Baisuifang Granule in treating cognitive malfunction after cerebral infarction. METHODS: One hundred and sixty patients with cerebral infarction were divided randomly into two groups. Eighty patients were treated with Baisuifang Granule and 80 with nimodipine for two months. Clinical observation and laboratory examinations were performed for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), clinical symptoms, Chinese Stroke Scale (CSS), hemorrheological indexes and fibrinogen before and after the treatment. RESULTS: Baisuifang Granule could improve MMSE, reduce the scores of clinical symptoms and CSS, and meliorate the blood rheology. The total effective rate for clinical symptoms in the Baisuifang treated group accounted to 76.25%, with statistical difference comparing to 58.75% of nimodipine treated group (P<0.05). There was significant difference in symptom integral, CSS and whole blood viscosity at the high shear rate, respectively (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Baisuifang Granule is an effective Chinese medicine for treating cognitive malfunction after cerebral infarction.

15182956|t|NaoXinQing, an anti-stroke herbal medicine, reduces hydrogen peroxide-induced injury in NG108-15 cells.
15182956|a|NaoXinQing (NXQ) is a patented and approved drug of Traditional Chinese Medicine that has been used for years for the treatment of syndrome of apoplexy, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study is designed to investigate the effects of NXQ on hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced cell damage in NG108-15 cells. Exposure to H(2)O(2) induces apoptosis-like cell injury. Preincubation of cells with NXQ alleviated H(2)O(2)-induced cell injury and apoptosis. This herb medicine also improves redox imbalance in cells under the exposure of H(2)O(2) as indicated by the attenuation in the reduction of activities of intracellular endogenous antioxidants, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase as well as catalase, and by the decrease in the leak of lactate dehydrogenase and the accumulation of malondialdehyde. These results indicate that NXQ significantly protects NG108-15 cells against H(2)O(2) challenge by improving redox imbalance and inhibiting apoptosis, which might represent mechanisms underlying its potential usage in the prevention and treatment of syndrome of apoplexy.

15151845|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term therapeutic effect of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with stent implantation in the treatment of myocardial infarction with severe pump failure. METHODS: The clinical data of 73 patients receiving PTCA and stent implantation for myocardial infarction with severity pump failure were analyzed and grouped according the occurrence of complications, degree of the vascular lesions and the complexity of the surgical procedures. Preoperative and postoperative ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) were compared in each case. RESULTS: The degree of vascular lesions and surgical complexity were not shown to relate to the occurrence of the complications. Except in cases complicated by chronic renal dysfunction, significant improvement was achieved in the patients 7 d after the operation (P<0.05), regardless of different degrees of vascular lesions and surgical complexity. CONCLUSION: PTCA with stent implantation is effective to improve the short-term cardiac function of patients with myocardial infarction and severe pump failure.

15339439|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of Jieyu Huoxue Decoction on rehabilitation of patients with depression after cerebral infarction. METHODS: Fifty four patients suffered from the depression after acute cerebral infarction were randomly divided into three groups: depression control group, fluoxetine treated group and Jieyu Huoxue Decoction treated group. Eighteen patients of cerebral infarction without depression were enrolled in the no depression control group randomly. The Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS), the modified Edinburgh-Scandinavia stroke scale (MESSS) and the activities of daily living (ADL) were evaluated before treatment, 30 and 60 days after treatment. RESULTS: After 30 and 60 days of treatment, SDS evaluation of the Jieyu Huoxue Decoction treated group showed significant difference as compared with the condition before treatment and that of the depression control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), MESSS evaluation and ADL evaluation also showed significant difference as compared with the condition before treatment and that of the depression control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); there was no obvious difference between the fluoxetine treated group and the Jieyu Huoxue Decoction treated group, but the Jieyu Huoxue Decoction treated group showed fewer symptoms and less side effect. CONCLUSION: Jieyu Huoxue Decoction can not only relieve depression after cerebral infarction, but also improve neurological functions.

15376392|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of "Huang Lian Jie Du Tang" active fraction (HLJDTAF) on experimental cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats was used to observe the protective effect of HLJDTAF on ischemia stroke. Common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) rat was used to analyse the effect of HLJDTAF on blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Common carotid artery occlusion and reperfusion repeatedly (CCAORR) in mice were used to test effect of HLJDTAF on gasp time, brain exponential and water content of brain. RESULTS: HLJDTAF could improve the abnormal behavior of MCAO rats and decrease the infarction area (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01). HLJDTAF could also significantly prolong the shorten gasp time of CCAORR mice, reduce the brain exponential and decrease the water content in brain (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: HLJDTAF can protect the brain ischemia injury.

15000890|t|Association of apolipoprotein E 4 polymorphism with cerebral infarction in Chinese Han population.
15000890|a|AIM: To study the association between APOE polymorphisms and cerebral infarction through a case-control study among the Chinese Han population. METHODS: First-ever cerebral infarction patients (n=226) whose ages ranged from 40 to 60 years old were recruited from Department of Neurology, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai, and Zhejiang Chinese Traditional Medicine Hospital, Zhejiang, China. Unrelated healthy controls (n=201) were selected from the general population in the same area with similar age and sex distribution. APOE was amplified by one-stage PCR using the forward primer: 5'-GGC ACG GCT GTC CAA GGA GCT-3' and reverse primer: 5'-GAT GGC GCT GAG GCC GCG CT-3'. The PCR product was digested directly with 5 U of CfoI and separated by a 20 % polyacrylamide (acrylamide: bis-acrylamide=29:1) nondenaturing gel. RESULTS: Both cerebral infarction patient and control groups were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The allele frequency of APOE*2, APOE*3, and APOE*4 was 4.6 %, 81.9 %, and 13.5 % respectively in the patients with cerebral infarction; 5.7 %, 87.3 %, and 7.0 % respectively in the healthy control group. Compared with APOE3/3 subjects, APOE4/4 carriers had a 2.1-fold risk of cerebral infarction (odds ratio 2.1, 95 % confidence limits 1.3 to 3.4). The allele frequency of APOE*4 in the cerebral infarction patient group was significantly higher than that in the control group (13.5 % vs 7.0 %; P=0.002). CONCLUSION: APOE 4 is a risk factor for cerebral infarction among the Chinese Han population.

15185839|a|Excessive activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and subsequent production of nitric oxide by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) contribute to neuronal damage resulting from hypoxic and ischemic insults. NMDARs and nNOS are coupled together at the postsynaptic membrane through their interaction with postsynaptic density protein (PSD) 95 via PSD-95/disc large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domains. We used NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy to screen medicinal herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) stroke therapy for compounds binding to the second PDZ domain (PDZ2) of PSD-95, the domain linking nNOS and PSD-95. Aqueous extract of Huangqin, the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Labiatae), showed significant binding to PDZ2 of PSD-95. The binding site of the active components in the extract overlapped with the nNOS/NR2B-binding pocket of PDZ2 of PSD-95. Four flavones, baicalin, norwogonoside, oroxylin A-glucuronide (oroxyloside), and wogonoside were isolated and found to account for the PDZ-binding activity of the extract. NMR titration experiments showed that baicalin and norwogonoside displayed the highest PDZ2 binding affinity, while oroxylin A-glucuronide and wogonoside showed 4-5 fold less potency in binding to the PDZ domain. Identification of the PDZ binding activity of these compounds will allow investigating whether or not it contributes to the observed clinical effects of Radix Scutellariae. Furthermore, these molecules might provide leads for the development of drugs targeting the signaling pathways mediated by PDZ domains.

15617507|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of Ligustrazine on IR after local cerebral ischemia of rat. METHOD: Models of rat IR after local cerebral ischemia were prepared by electrocagulation of the middle cerebral artery, and changes of serum insulin, tomer necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1), nitric oxide (NO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were observed 2 weeks after the ischemia. RESULT: Ligustrazine could significantly reduce serum insulin (P < 0.01), the content of plasma ET-1 (P < 0.01) and serum TNF-alpha (P < 0.01), the activity of brain tissue NO and NOS (P < 0.01). The drug also increased insulin sensitivity indexes (ISI). CONCLUSION: The protective effects of Ligustrazion on IR cerebral ischemia may be related to decreasing ET-1 content in plasma, TNF-alpha content in serum, NO content and NOS activities in tissue.

14703425|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between small, dense LDL (sLDL) and stroke in Chinese population. METHODS: The plasma level of sLDL was examined by 2% - 16% nondenatured gradient gel electrophoresis in 204 patients with stroke, including 103 cases of ischemic cerebral infarction (ICI), 51 cases of lacunar infarction (LI), and 50 cases of subcortical hemorrhage (SH), and in 341 sex- and age-matched controls in China. Traditional risk factors for stroke were investigated as well. RESULTS: The plasma level of sLDL was significantly higher in patients with ICI and LI (54 +/- 8% and 52 +/- 7%) than in the controls (47 +/- 11%, both P < 0.01). However, the plasma sLDL of the CH patients was 50 +/- 9%, not significantly different from that of the controls (P > 0.05). Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that sLDL was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure, age, and the levels of triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that those with sLDL > 50% had increase of risk of ischemic cerebral infarction (OR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.649 - 5.691, P < 0.001) independent of other risk factors. The relationship between sLDL abnormality and LI and between sLDL abnormality and SH had no statistical significance (both P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: sLDL is significantly associated with ischemic cerebral infarction independent of other risk factors in Chinese population. sLDL may be a new marker for stroke at least in this Chinese population.

15015383|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of Naosaitong (NST) on the cerebral blood flow (CBF), the infarct areas and blood rheology in animals. METHOD: NST's cerebral protective effects were investigated by using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), bilateral common carotid artery ligation, and carrogeenin-induced thrombus model rats, being administrated with medicine for seven days. RESULTS: Three dosage groups of NST increased CBF in anesthetized rabbits, reduced the infarct areas in MCAO rats, decreased the physical sign indexes, and water quantities. They increased the activities of Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and Catalase (CAT), decreased the contractions of Lipid peroxidase (LPO) and Lactate (LD) in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats; shortened the length of thrombus and improved the blood rheology in the carrogeenin-induced thrombus model rats, and prolonged hypoxia-resisting time in mice. CONCLUSION: NST can evidently increase CBF in rabbits, improve the cerebral edema brain tissues' injure and nervous physical sign indexes in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats, reduce the infarct areas in MCAO rats, postpone thrombosis course and have antioxidation effects, which show that NST can obviously protect the brain tissues in the experimental cerebral infarct model rats.

12850540|t|Neuroprotective effects of Buyang Huanwu Decoction on neuronal injury in hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia in rats.
12850540|a|Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been developed as a drug to be used for treatment of stroke for hundreds of years. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, the effects of BYHWD on delayed neuronal death of hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia were examined in rats. Transient forebrain ischemia in a duration of 15 min was induced with the four-vessel occlusion method. BYHWD (per 6.65 g/kg) was given orally to rats twice each day for 7 days before ischemia. In BYHWD-pretreated rats, the neuronal injury in the hippocampal CA1 region was significantly less than that of controls. Oral administration of BYHWD also markedly attenuated the number of TUNEL-positive neurons and suppressed the expression of caspase-3p20, a product of catalytically active caspase-3, in the CA1 region. Our results suggest that an inhibition of caspase-3 and apoptosis by BYHWD may partially account for its neuroprotection against ischemic injury in the hippocampal CA1 region.

12889173|t|Variability and validity of a simple visual rating scale in grading white matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging.
12889173|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A new simple visual rating scale can be used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to grade the severity of white matter changes (WMC). The authors sought to study the interobserver variability and the validity of this visual rating scale against a computer-aided quantitative method in measuring WMC. METHODS: The authors examined 220 magnetic resonance images from stroke-free patients with traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis and middle cerebral artery stenosis who were participants in a clinical trial requiring MRI examination. The severity of WMC was graded from 0 (no WMC) to 3 (severe WMC). For the quantitative assessment of WMC, the volume of WMC were measured with a computer-aided, automated segmentation method. The interobserver variability was also determined. RESULTS: The mean volumes were significantly different among the different groups, which were scored 1, 2, and 3 (1324.59, 6475.48, and 25,440.05 mm3, respectively; 1-way analysis of variance, P < .001). Interobserver variability for grading WMC was good in different locations of the brain. Excellent results were found in the frontal lobe (kappa = 0.829) and the parietal-occipital lobe (kappa = 0.646), whereas poor results were found in the basal ganglia (kappa = 0.391). There was perfect agreement between the 2 observers in 89.1% for the frontal lobe and 77.0% for the parietal-occipital lobe. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that this simple visual rating scale is a valid and reliable method for grading WMC in the lobar region but not in the basal ganglion.

12745708|t|Acquired heterotopic ossification in the settings of cerebral anoxia and alternative therapy: two cases.
12745708|a|Acquired Heterotopic Ossification (HO) has been well described in the literature as a recognized complication following spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and joint arthroplasty. Commonly, large proximal limb joints are affected. The underlying mechanisms for ectopic bone formation remain poorly elucidated. Post-stroke hemiplegia as a cause of neurogenic HO is rare, and no published reports of HO occurring after anoxic brain injury in adults have been documented. This study reports two unusual cases of acquired HO: (1) Polyarticular HO involving the ankle joint in a 24-year-old Chinese female who suffered severe anoxic encephalopathy following near drowning which resulted in persistent vegetative state; and (2) Elbow HO in chronic post-stroke hemiplegia occurring as a complication of alternative therapy following repeated forceful manipulation by a traditional practitioner in a 46 year-old male.

12875062|t|Clinical observation in 45 cases of hemorrhagic apoplexy of the acute stage treated by promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis.
12875062|a|To explore the therapeutic effects of the method of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis on hemorrhagic apoplexy of acute stage, 45 cases were treated by the method and observed for their conscious state and motor function, which were compared with 40 cases treated with regular western drugs. The results showed that the effective rate in the treated group was 82.2% and that in control group 60% with a significant difference (P < 0.05) between the two groups. In the treated group, the scores of the conscious state and the motor function after treatment were elevated dramatically (P < 0.01), indicating a much better effect in the treated group than in the control group.

12895681|t|Pharmacological evidence for antidementia effect of Choto-san (Gouteng-san), a traditional Kampo medicine.
12895681|a|To clarify the clinical efficacy of one of the traditional medicines in the treatment of patients with vascular dementia, we investigated the pharmacological activities of Choto-san in animal models. Pretreatment with Choto-san (0.75-6.0 g/kg po), a component herb, Chotoko (75-600 mg/kg po), and indole alkaloids and phenolic fractions of Chotoko prevented ischemia-induced impairment of spatial learning behaviour in water maze performance of mice. A single administration of Choto-san (0.5 to 6.0 g/kg po) or Chotoko (Uncaria genus) produced a dose-dependent antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and partly inhibited the induction of the apoplexy in stroke-prone SHR (SHR-SP). Choto-san, Chotoko, and its phenolic constituents, (-)epicatechin and caffeic acid, significantly protected NG108-15 cells from injury induced by H(2)O(2) exposure in vitro and also inhibited lipid peroxidation in the brain homogenate. Indole alkaloids, rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline (1-100 microM), reversibly reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced current concentration dependently in NMDA receptor-expressed Xenopus oocytes. These results suggest that antidementia effects of Choto-san are due to antihypertensive, free radical scavenging and antiexcitotoxic effects, which are attributed at least partly to phenolic compounds and indole alkaloids contained in Chotoko.

12809358|t|Neuroprotective effects of tanshinones in transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice.
12809358|a|Tanshinones are the major lipid soluble pharmacological constituents of Danshen, the dried roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Labiatae), a well known traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases including stroke. Potential neuroprotective effects of tanshinones IIA (TsIIA) and IIB (TsIIB) were examined in adult mice subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Our results revealed that TsIIA (16 mg/kg) readily penetrated the blood brain barrier reaching a peak concentration of 0.41 nmol/g brain wet weight 60 minutes after intraperitoneal injection and decreased slowly over several hours. Twenty-four hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, brain infarct volume was reduced by 30% and 37% following treatment with TsIIA and TsIIB, respectively. The reduction in brain infarct volume was accompanied by a significant decrease in the observed neurological deficit. Tanshinones or other structurally related compounds may have potential for further development as neuroprotective drugs.

15339602|t|[Puzzle of hormone replacement therapy and prospect of the role of traditional Chinese medicine in treating postmenopausal syndrome].
15339602|a|In July 2002, the Women's Heath Initiative (WHI) clinical trial, designed to clarify the risks and benefits of combination hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to the postmenopausal women declared that interim safety review after an average follow-up of 5.2 years found that a combination of estrogen and progestin frequently prescribed to postmenopausal women in USA increased the risk of invasive breast cancer, heart disease, stroke, and pulmonary embolism while reduced bone fractures and colorectal cancer. The overall risks of HRT outweigh the benefits, which provides an opportunity for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) going abroad. A variety of clinical and experimental evidences have showed that TCM exerts quite satisfactory effect on relieving postmenopausal symptoms with little adverse effect, hence a potential role to replace or to improve HRT or to reduce the side effect induced by HRT.

12651248|t|Comparative study of serum lipids and serum lipoprotein spectrum in patients with cerebrovascular diseases.
12651248|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences of serum lipids and serum lipoprotein spectrum between patients with cerebral hemorrhage (CH) and cerebral infarction (CI), and study their features of expression in the 2 cerebral conditions. METHODS: Serum levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (vLDLC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and serum lipoprotein electrophoretogram were determined in 59 CI and 21 CH patients as well as in 30 normal subjects. RESULTS: CI patients had higher levels of TC, LDLC, alpha-lipoprotein (alpha LP), beta-lipoprotein (beta LP) and intermediate-density beta-lipoprotein (int beta LP) than the normal subjects, and the CH patients had lower LDLC level than the CI patients. The CH patients had also higher levels of beta LP, int beta LP and LDLC than the normal subjects. Progressive regression analysis was performed and resulted in the selection of beta LP, int beta LP and HDLC as the best discriminators for cerebral vascular diseases, which were valid in classifying 71.3% of the cases included in this study. CONCLUSION: beta LP, int beta LP and HDLC are important clinical indicators to predict cerebral vascular diseases.

12856858|t|Effect of salvia miltiorrhiza bunge on cerebral infarct in ischemia-reperfusion injured rats.
12856858|a|According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, cerebral infarction results from blood stasis, and the method of quickening the blood and dispelling stasis is used to treat cerebral infarct. salvia miltorrhiza bunge (SM) is a Chinese herb, which is considered to have an action of quickening the blood and dispelling stasis, and is frequently used to treat related disorders of blood stasis such as cerebrovascular accident and ischemic heart disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of SM on cerebral infarct in ischemia-reperfusion injured rats. A total of 30 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were studied. A model of focal cerebral infarct was developed by occluding both common carotid arteries and the right middle cerebral artery for 90 minutes. After 24 hours reperfusion, the rats were killed and the brain tissue was stained with 2, 3, 5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC). The areas of cerebral infarct were calculated, and lumino-chemiluminesence (CL) counts and lucigenin-CL counts of peripheral blood taken at this time were measured. The changes in the area of cerebral infarct were used as an index to evaluate the effect of SM on cerebral infarct. The results indicated that pretreatment with intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg SM reduced the area of cerebral infarct and also reduced the luminol-CL counts of peripheral blood in ischemia-reperfusion injured rats. This study has demonstrated that SM can reduce the area of cerebral infarct in ischemia-reperfusion injured rats, suggesting it may be useful in the treatment of cerebral infarct in humans. The therapeutic effect of SM may be partly due to its free radical scavenging activities.

12856857|t|Safety and efficacy assessment of chungpyesagan-tang for acute ischemic stroke.
12856857|a|Chungpyesagan-tang is one of the most well-known traditional herbal formulations frequently used for treatment of acute stroke in Korea. Therefore, this study aims to assess the clinical safety and efficacy of chungpyesagan-tang on acute ischemic stroke. We recruited acute cerebral infarction subjects within 1 week after onset time. Then, we prescribed chungpyesagan-tang to an Oriental medical treatment group (OM-group) for 2 weeks and enrolled a Western medical treatment group (WM-group) which received only Western biomedical care as a control. In this study, the OM-group was composed of 75 subjects. However, 14 of them dropped out, as two had progressive stroke while 12 complained of diarrhea. Thus, 61 cases were included in the analysis and compared to the 76 cases of the WM-group. The improvement of OM-group was better than that of the WM-group according to the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), but not by the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). There were no definite abnormalities on labortory safety asessment. Therefore, we suggest that chungpyesagan-tang may have therapeutic effects, acting to reduce the severity of stroke and improving functional recovery without definite hepatic or renal toxicity when given for the first 2 weeks after a stroke.

14641479|t|Angiotensin converting enzyme gene polymorphism and traditional Sasang classification in Koreans with cerebral infarction.
14641479|a|Sasang constitutional medicine is a major branch of Korean traditional oriental medicine. Constitutions of Sasang medicine refer to Taeyangin, Taeumin, Soyangin, and Soumin. The differences of disease severity to be shown in the constitution may be due to genetic factors. Therefore, we examined interrelationship among cerebral infarction, CI, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism, and Sasang constitutional classification. We investigated the association between ACE genotype and CI by case-control study in a Korean population. We also classified CI patients and control group into groups according to Sasang constitutional medicine. 208 CI patients and 643 controls without CI were examined. ACE genotype was determined by 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel separation after DNA amplification. The ACE/DD genotype was not associated with CI. The frequency of Taeumin of Sasang constitutional medicine in patients with CI was significantly higher than that in controls (chi2=41.202, p<0.001). However, the Taeumin constitution did not enhance the relative risk for CI in the subjects with ACE/DD genotype. Although we did not find any association between ACE gene polymorphism and CI in Koreans, there were significant differences in allele frequencies between Koreans and Europeans, but not Japanese and Chinese populations. Furthermore, we first attempted to evaluate the efficacy of Sasang constitutional medicine, and to find an association with CI.

12624526|t|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist activity in traditional Chinese stroke medicines.
12624526|a|Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history in stroke therapy and its therapeutic efficacy has been confirmed by clinical studies. The molecular basis of the neuroprotective effects is unknown. We wondered whether or not the neuroprotective effect of TCMs might be due to their N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist properties. We used the patch-clamp technique to screen 22 TCM stroke drugs for NMDAR antagonist activity in cultured cortical neurons. The drugs were also screened for their ability to abate NMDA-induced neurotoxicity. Aqueous extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis, Stephania tetrandra, and Salvia miltiorrhiza blocked currents induced by NMDA (200 microM, 10 microM glycine, 0 Mg2+) at a holding potential of -80 mV by 83.45+/-4.34, 38.65+/-7.50, and 52.97+/-1.78%, respectively. The block of the NMDA-evoked currents was voltage-dependent and showed a negative slope conductance reminiscent of Mg2+. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry revealed the presence of 12.5, 2, and 8.7 mM Mg2+ in the extracts of S. baicalensis,S. tetrandra, and S. miltiorrhiza, respectively. None of these extracts blocked NMDA-induced neuronal death. The Uncaria rhynchophylla extract blocked NMDA-evoked currents by 54.98+/-8.61% even at +60 mV and reduced NMDA-induced neuronal death by 59.13+/-3.52%. NMDAR antagonist activity may underlie the neuroprotective effects of this TCM. Some TCM drugs may exert therapeutic effects due to their Mg2+ content.

13678228|t|Comparative efficacy of Keishi-bukuryo-gan and pentoxifylline on RBC deformability in patients with "oketsu" syndrome.
13678228|a|Keishi-bukuryo-gan (Gui-Zhi-Fu-Ling-Wan) (KBG) is one of the prescriptions in Japanese traditional medicine for improving the "oketsu" syndrome, so-called blood stasis syndrome. "Oketsu" syndrome is an important pathological conception in Japanese traditional medicine and often accompanies cerebro-vascular disorders. Previously, we were able to reveal a deterioration of RBC (Red blood cell) deformability and viscoelasticity in patients with "oketsu" syndrome. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether KBG has an effect on RBC deformability in comparison with pentoxifylline (PXF). The subjects were 30 male patients with multiple lacunar infarctions. Eighteen patients (44-79 yrs, mean +/- SD, 66.1 +/- 10.7 yrs) were treated with 12 g of KBG daily for 4 weeks (KBG group). Twelve patients (59-78 yrs, 70.7 +/- 6.4 yrs) were treated with 300 mg of PXF daily for 4 weeks (PXF group). Based on the "oketsu" score, the patients of each group were divided into two subgroups, a non-"oketsu" group ("oketsu" score 20 points or less) and an "oketsu" group ("oketsu" score 21 points or higher). KBG had significant effects on RBC deformability as evaluated by filtration method. KBG also significantly increased intracellular ATP content, as did PXF. Moreover, KBG was more effective for patients with a more severe "oketsu" state. However, PXF was effective only in patients with "oketsu" syndrome, who might have deteriorated RBC deformability. In conclusion, the effect of KBG on RBC deformability was by no means inferior to PXF.

12512790|t|Validating a new non-penetrating sham acupuncture device: two randomised controlled trials.
12512790|a|For clinical trials of acupuncture, it would be desirable to have a sham procedure that is indistinguishable from the real treatment, yet inactive. A sham needle has been designed which telescopes instead of penetrating the skin. The Park Sham Device involves an improved method of supporting the sham needle and requires validation. The objective of these studies was to test whether the sham procedure using the new device was 1) indistinguishable from the same procedure using real needles in acupuncture naïve subjects, and 2) inactive, where the specific needle sensation (de qi) is taken as a surrogate measure of activity. The studies were designed as subject and assessor blind, randomised controlled trials. Study 1) included 58 patients enrolled in a clinical trial of acupuncture for acute stroke. Study 2) included 63 healthy, acupuncture naïve, adult volunteers. The interventions used were real or sham acupuncture using the Park Sham Device. Study 1) was set in a district general hospital, and study 2) in a university laboratory. The outcome measure in study 1) was the form of treatment that patients believed they had received. In study 2) the outcome measure was experience of de qi, as judged by three acupuncture experts. No patient in either group(study 1) believed he or she had been treated with the sham needle. In 40 volunteers (study 2) for whom experts achieved consensus, the relative risk of experiencing de qi with real acupuncture to that with sham acupuncture was 15.38 (95% CI 2.26 to 104.86). The inter-rater reliability of all 13 experts (study 2), calculated from their judgements on 10 subjects selected by randomisation, was 0.52 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.61). In conclusion, the results suggest that the procedure using the new device is indistinguishable from the same procedure using real needles in acupuncture naïve subjects, and is inactive, where the specific needle sensation (de qi) is taken as a surrogate measure of activity. It is therefore a valid control for acupuncture trials. The findings also lend support to the existence of de qi, a major concept underlying traditional Chinese acupuncture.

16579082|a|Forty patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID) were randomly assigned to the treatment group (25 cases) treated with Jian Nao Ning (JNN) and the duxil control group (15 cases). Memory function were assessed at baseline and endpoint using memory subscales of a battery of New Psychometric Tests (Chinese version) including mini-mental state examination (MMSE), verbal memory, and non-verbal memory, etc. After treatment, the mean scores of verbal memory in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (P<0.05) and total memory scores of memory items (P<0.001) in JNN group increased significantly; and improvement in episodic memory function including story recall (immediate and delayed), delayed word recall, verbal learning and verbal recognition and visual recognition in the JNN group was better than that in the duxil control group, suggesting that JNN can obviously improve memory function for the patients with mild or moderate multi-infarct dementia.

12396075|t|Induction of heme oxygenase 1 by Ginkgo biloba in neuronal cultures and potential implications in ischemia.
12396075|a|Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) is a standardized extract originating in traditional Chinese medicine. Ginkgo biloba dried leaves have been used for centuries to treat various neurological conditions. The constituents from the extract are likely to have synergistic effects that have been shown to be protective against oxidative stress injury. However, the cellular mechanisms of protection afforded by Ginkgo biloba are still unclear. The cascade leading to neuronal cell death in acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions, such as cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer's disease, has been postulated to be mediated by free radical damage. We tested the hypothesis that the neuroprotective action of EGb 761 could be due partially to an induction of heme oxygenase I (HO1). We and others have previously reported that modulation of HO total activity may well have direct physiological implications in stroke and in Alzheimer's disease. Heme oxygenase acts as an antioxidant enzyme by degrading heme into iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin which is rapidly converted into bilirubin. Through the use of primary neuronal cultures, we demonstrated that EGb 761 induces HO1 in a dose-dependent manner (0, 10, 50, 100 and 500 microg/ml) and time-dependent manner with a maximal induction at 8 hr. We are proposing that several of the protective effects of EGb 761 in ischemia could be mediated through beneficial actions of heme degradation and its metabolites.

12630544|t|Homocysteine, endothelial dysfunction, and coronary artery disease: emerging strategy for secondary prevention.
12630544|a|Atherosclerosis is an important medical problem of the 21st century, but traditional risk factors could only account for 50% of the problem. Hyperhomocysteinemia is emerging as an independent atherosclerosis risk factor, associated with folate deficiency, renal failure, and relative deficiency of MTHFR (C677T polymorphism) or other enzymes depending on gender, age, and smoking status. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported to occur in 11-22% of western people, in 3-5% of normal asymptomatic Chinese subjects aged 18-70 years in Hong Kong, Macau, Sydney, and San Francisco, 23-36% of Chinese in Hong Kong with premature coronary artery disease, and 29% of a nonselective series of coronary subjects in Hong Kong. Evidence is accumulating that documents its associations with atherosclerosis disease in both case-control observations and prospective cohort studies, in vitro experiments, and in vivo experimental models in both animals and human subjects, as well as the successful improvement by homocysteine-lowering of endothelial function as surrogate atherosclerosis endpoints in asymptomatic human and coronary patients (secondary prevention). A number of large scale homocysteine-lowering trials are currently underway for stroke and heart attacks prevention. Collectively these trials will include more than 65,000 patients at high-risk for cardiovascular and stroke events, and should provide a reliable evidence-base for prevention.

12376307|t|Treatment of stroke with "five-center needling": clinical observation of 78 cases.
12376307|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of "five center needling" in the management of stroke. METHOD: Seventy-eight patients suffering stroke were divided into 2 groups to receive either routine acupuncture (control group, n=38) treatment or "five-center needing" therapy besides the routine treatment (treatment group, n=40). The curative effect between the 2 groups was compared after 30 days treatment. RESULT: No significant differences were noted between the 2 groups in terms of the curative effect in general (P>0.05). But "five-center needling" showed better effect in treating the syndromes of wind-fire stirring up the orifices and phlegm stagnation leading to mental disorder, and was more effective in the management of hemorrhagic stroke than in ischemic stroke, and in treating the left-side cerebral injuries than in treating those on right side (P<0.05).

12222672|t|Stroke therapy in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): prospects for drug discovery and development.
12222672|a|Brain injuries resulting from stroke are a major and increasing public health problem in both developed and developing countries worldwide. China's extensive experience in the use of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) in stroke therapy indicates that TCM preparations are effective, with few or no side-effects. There are more than 100 traditional medicines in use for stroke therapy in China. Some of their therapeutic effects in stroke have been confirmed by recent clinical studies. A large number of compounds have been isolated from TCMs and most of these resources have not yet been characterized for pharmacological purposes. Here, this article explains how TCM provides an extensive and knowledge-rich foundation for implementing a strategically focused pharmacological research program aimed at the development of new drugs.

METHODS: The blood levels of FT3, FT4, T, E2, CO in groups of sthenic Heat (SH), sthenic Cold (SC), asthenic Heat (AH) and asthenic Cold (AC) and the healthy control group were measured. The number of cases in each group was 50. RESULTS: (1) FT3 and FT4 were higher in Heat Syndrome than that in Cold Syndrome in the order of AH > SH > control > SC > AC, it revealed that the basal metabolic rate and oxygen consumption in Heat Syndrome were increased, while it in Cold Syndrome, it declined. (2) CO was higher in SH, SC than that in AH and AC, the order was SC > SH > control > AH > AC, it revealed that CO was one of the factors correlated to asthenic and sthenic syndrome, but not relevant to Heat Syndrome and Cold Syndrome. (3) T was higher in Heat Syndrome than that in Cold Syndrome, but E2 showed the opposite, suggesting that T was one of the factors for forming Heat Syndrome, and E2 for Cold Syndrome. CONCLUSION: The levels of FT3, FT4, T, E2 are basis of pathophysiology related with forming HS and CS.

11779909|t|Does acupuncture have additional value to standard poststroke motor rehabilitation?
11779909|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A significant number of patients remain severely disabled after stroke despite rehabilitation with standard treatment modalities. Acupuncture has been reported as an alternative modality. This study aims to examine whether acupuncture has additional value to standard poststroke motor rehabilitation. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out in a stroke rehabilitation unit in Hong Kong. One hundred six Chinese patients with moderate or severe functional impairment were included at days 3 to 15 after acute stroke. They were stratified into the moderate and the severe groups before randomization into the control arm receiving standard modalities of treatment, which included physiotherapy, occupational and speech therapy, and skilled medical and nursing care, and the intervention arm receiving in addition traditional Chinese manual acupuncture. A mean of 35 acupuncture sessions on 10 main acupoints were performed over a 10-week period. Outcome measures included Fugl-Meyer assessment, Barthel Index, and Functional Independence Measure, respectively, at weeks 0, 5, and 10, performed by blinded assessors. RESULTS: At baseline, patients in each arm were comparable in all important prognostic characteristics. No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 arms for any of the outcome measures at week 10 or outcome changes over time. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional Chinese manual acupuncture on the body has no additional value to standard poststroke motor rehabilitation.

12014128|t|The effect of electro-acupuncture on motor function recovery in patients with acute cerebral infarction: a randomly controlled trial.
12014128|a|The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of electro-acupuncture treatment in acute phase of cerebral infarction on the motor functions. In this randomly controlled trial, 86 patients were allocated to two groups, the experimental group given clinical and electro-acupuncture treatments for a period of 4 weeks, and the control group given clinical treatment plus active and/or passive functional exercise. The result showed that the level of impairment and disability in both groups were improvement according to the Chinese Stroke Scale, Brunnstrom-Fugl-Meyer score, and Barthel Index throughout the study and 3 months after. The motor functions and the activities of daily living (ADL) were improved significantly in the electro-acupuncture group as compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Also, the results showed greater reduction of neurological deficit in the electro-acupuncture group than in the control group.CONCLUSION: Early acupuncture treatment for acute stroke patients may improve motor functions, and consequently the activities of daily living.

12575554|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the tongue proper and tongue fur quantitatively in stroke patients. METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-eight stroke patients were studied by means of TCM Glossoscopy Expert System, the techniques of color digitized image processing and pattern recognition were applied to objectively study the changes of tongue proper and tongue fur. RESULTS: Dark-red tongue was the commonest tongue proper, which revealed in 128 cases (33.86%) in the 378 patients investigated. There was significant difference of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) values in dark-red tongue as compared with those in pale-purple tongue, pale-white tongue, pale-red tongue, deep red tongue, purple-red tongue and blue-purple tongue (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Thick and yellow greasy fur was the commonest in 214 cases of acute stage, it accounted for 30.84% and with a total of 66 cases. There was also significant difference in R/G and R/B values among different types of tongue fur (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This quantitative study on stroke patients regarding to tongue proper and tongue fur by means of TCM Glossoscopy Expert System provides a base for standardization and quantification of diagnosis of stroke patients.

11749837|t|Effects and mechanisms of triacetylshikimic acid on platelet adhesion to neutrophils induced by thrombin and reperfusion after focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
11749837|a|AIM: To investigate the effect of triacetylshikimic acid (TSA) on the platelet adhesion to neutrophils and P-selectin expression on activated platelet membrane induced by thrombin and reperfusion after focal cerebral ischemia. METHODS: The platelet adhesion to neutrophils was evaluated by rosette assay, and P-selectin expression on platelet membrane was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: TSA 10 - 1000 micromol/L markedly inhibited thrombin(0.4 kU/L)-induced platelet adhesion to neutrophils. The platelet adhesion to neutrophils induced by a 21-h reperfusion after middle cerebral artery occlusion for 3 h was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by TSA 50 - 200 mg/kg given by ig immediately and at 60 min again after the onset of cerebral ischemia. TSA was also shown to decrease the P-selectin expression on platelet surface induced by thrombin in washed platelet and by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 5 micromol/L in whole blood. CONCLUSION: Reperfusion after cerebral ischemia and thrombin induced platelet adhesion to neutrophils, which could be reduced by TSA probably due to its inhibition of P-selectin expression on activated platelets.

11405917|a|Neiguan (PC-6) is a traditional acupoint in the bilateral forearms, overlying the median nerve trunk. Neiguan electroacupuncture (EA) has been believed to affect cardiovascular function and used in traditional Chinese medicine to improve or treat a wide range of health conditions and diseases, including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, hypertension, and hypotension. However, few physiological studies have assessed the beneficial effects of Neiguan EA on the cardiovascular function. In the present study, we investigated its effects on the cardiovascular function in normal open-chest dogs under pentobarbital and fentanyl anesthesia. We also obtained left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume (P-V) data with a micromanometer catheter and a volumetric conductance catheter. Mean arterial pressure, end-diastolic volume, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and end-systolic pressure gradually decreased by 5 to 10% over 1.5 h without Neiguan EA. Neiguan EA at 40 Hz, however, increased these cardiovascular variables by 10 to 15%, especially end-systolic elastance (Ees) by 40% (p<0.05) over 15 to 60 min. After Neiguan EA was stopped at 1 h, these facilitated cardiovascular variables decreased below the pre-EA level. This beneficial effect of electroacupuncture may contribute to the effectiveness of the acupuncture in Chinese medicine.

11789587|t|Effects of uwhangchungsimwon on cell viability, proliferation, and gene expression of human neuronal cell line IMR32.
11789587|a|Uwhangchungsimwon (pill, UC) is one of the traditional Korean medical prescriptions that has been most frequently used for stroke. To characterize the effects of UC on human neuronal cells, the human neuroblastoma cell line IMR32 was treated with UC, and cell viability, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression were analyzed. The effect of UC on recovery of cell viability was analyzed following stress induction by nutrient depletion or cold shock. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle showed that UC inhibits cell cycle progression of IMR32 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. UC was also identified to increase cell viability and suppress apoptosis induction by a DNA-damaging agent, etoposide. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that expressions of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and its downstream effect, Waf1, are stimulated whereas expressions of positive cell cycle regulators, c-Myc, c-Fos, and Cyclin D1 were repressed by UC treatment. Moreover, while expression levels of apoptosis inhibitors, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were increased following UC treatment, that of an apoptosis promoter, Bax, was decreased. In addition, expression of BMP-7, which has been recently demonstrated to improve the motor neuron recovery from stroke, was induced by UC while it was not detected in untreated cells. Taken together, our data suggest that the pharmacoclinical effects of UC might be derived in part from its negative regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis through the transcriptional control of related genes.

11938862|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the multiple parameters of TCM Syndrome-types and the acute cerebral infarction (ACI) with blood stasis type. METHODS: Sixty-six acute cerebral infarction patients with blood stasis Syndrome, various vascular active factors such as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), the activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), the concentration of prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) etc. were determined. RESULTS: (1) In Incidental Syndrome, those "Phlegm" and "stasis" predominant, mainly manifested as Wind-Phlegm-Blood stasis (WPBS), Qi deficiency-blood stasis (QDBS) and Phlegm-Heat-bowel excess (PHBE) Syndrome all showed t-PA activity lowered, among them, QDBS Syndrome lowered more obviously (P < 0.01); and in fundamental deficiency predominant Syndrome such as Yin-deficiency and Wind-move (YDWM) Syndrome, the active t-PA content increased (P < 0.05); in Liver Yang ascending (LYA) Syndrome and YDWM Syndrome, the 6-keto-PGF1 alpha lowered very significantly. (2) Through regression analysis, although influencing the severity of acute blood stasis was related with 3 factors (t-PA activity, nervous system defect score and age growth), but single factor linear relationship analysis indicated that did not existed positive-negative relationship. (3) Through statistical analysis, the factor influencing nervous system defect scores was positively related with blood stasis score (r = 0.70, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: (1) The basis of WPBS, QDBS and PHBE Syndrome mainly was fibrinolytic system activity lowering, and YDWM and LYA Syndrome prostaglandin system activity lowering. Comprehensive analysis of multiple parameters would be helpful to differentiate the ACI blood stasis stage. (2) Single parameter would not help to differentiate the types of ACI blood stasis stage, its change merely denoted the existence of blood stasis, its type should be differentiated after comprehensive analysis. (3) Those influencing nervous system scoring, mainly was blood stasis score, which suggested that the importance of activating blood circulation to remove stasis in preventing and treating ACI. (4) Put forward ACI blood stasis, and the quantification for new standard of Syndrome for discussion.

11186247|t|Anti-hypercholesterolaemia, antioxidant activity and free radical scavenger effects of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions used for stroke.
11186247|a|The generation of oxygen radicals and lipid peroxidation may be factors in the cerebral damage secondary to ischaemia of the cerebrovascular disease, as in stroke. Five traditional Chinese medicinal prescriptions were investigated for their antioxidant activity: Shiee Fuu Jwu Iu Tang (TCMP1), Oh Yaw Shuen Chin Saan (TCMP2), Buu Yang Hwan Wuu Tang (TCMP3), Sheau Shiuh Ming Tang (TCMP4), and Chir Hwu Jia Long Guu Muu Lih Tang (TCMP5). Anti-lipid peroxidation, anti-superoxide formation and free radical scavenger activity were determined by the FeCl2--ascorbic acid-induced lipid peroxidation effects on lipids in-vitro, xanthine oxidase inhibition, cytochrome C system and an electron spin resonance spectrometer, respectively. The results showed that TCMP5 had greater anti-lipid peroxidation and anti-superoxide formation activity than the other prescriptions. TCMP4 had the greatest free radical scavenging effect, TCMP5 showed the greatest superoxide radical scavenger activity and TCMP3 showed the greatest hydroxyl radical scavenger activity. Tests were also performed to evaluate the effects of the five prescriptions on blood lipid in-vivo. The test showed that the prescriptions decreased the level of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in serum in high cholesterol-fed rats. From these results, it seems probable that these prescriptions may be effective in the prevention and therapy of stroke and ischaemia.

11789205|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of parameters of nitric oxide (NO), endothelin (ET) and blood stasis syndrome (BSS) of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in acute cerebral infarction (ACI). METHODS: Seventy-three patients of ACI (ACI group) were divided into two groups by the score of BSS: BSS group (included 18 cases of serious BSS, 19 cases of moderate BSS, and 21 cases of mild BSS); and non-BSS group (15 cases); while 30 healthy subjects were taken as the control group, their NO and ET were determined. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the level of ET and ratio of ET/NO raised significantly in the ACI group and the BSS group (P < 0.01). The levels of ET and ratio of ET/NO of mild, moderate and serious BSS increased in order, but only the serious BSS in comparing with mild, moderate group of BSS had significant difference (P < 0.01). The NO levels of ACI group, non-BSS group in comparing with healthy control, there was significant decrease (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The NO concentration among the mild, moderate and serious group of BSS had insignificant difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: NO and ET participates the formation and development of ACI, owing to the disturbed NO and ET secretion by vascular, nerve cells etc., these might be the pathologic basis of BSS occurrence.

11789263|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of intravascular laser irradiation of blood (ILIB) therapy on cellular immunity, change of T-lymphocyte subsets and humoral immunity in senile cerebral infarction patients of Kidney deficiency type. METHODS: Seventy-five patients were divided randomly into the ILIB group and the control group treated by conventional medicine (CM). Serum CD3, CD4, CD8, IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C4 levels of patients were determined before and after treatment for self-control and comparing between various groups and that of normal control. RESULTS: Before treatment, in patients of both groups, the levels of CD3, CD4, CD4/CD8, C3 were all lower than normal levels significantly, C4 and IgM higher than normal (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), the level of IgG lowered in patients inclined to Kidney-Yang deficiency and raised in those inclined to Kidney-Yin deficiency (P < 0.01). After treatment, in the ILIB group, CD3, CD4 and CD4/CD8 raised significantly (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), IgG and C3 varied towards normal control (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), and C4 lowered but without significance. In the control group, the indexes changed also toward normal but without significance except the change of IgG (P < 0.05). As for IgA and IgM, marked changes were not found in both groups in comparison between before and after treatment. CONCLUSION: ILIB therapy could bi-directionally regulate cellular and humoral immunity in senile cerebral infarction patients of Kidney deficiency type, which was similar to the function in supplementing Qi and invigorating Kidney of Chinese herbal medicine.

11321431|a|Drugs with the efficacy of modifying rheological properties of blood, blood vessels and their interactions are denoted by "hemorheologicals". Drugs of anti-hyperviscosemia, anti-coagulants, anti-platelet drugs, anti-thrombotics, vasodilators, endothelial cell protectors and anti-arthrosclerosis should be considered as hemorheologicals due to the actions in keeping blood fluidity and in maintaining normal vascular functions. The studies in hemorheology indicate that a tendency of hyperviscosity, hypercoagulation and being prone to thrombosis is prevalent in the elderly. Hemorheologicals are importance for and aging and life-threatening diseases. Blood stasis syndrome is a common pathological syndrome in the elderly. In traditional Chinese medicine, the treatment for the syndrome is by herbs which activates blood circulation to remove blood stasis. The herbs have the efficacy of improving hemorheological events. Therefore, the herbs are the source for developing hemorheologicals. Ligustrazine isolated from Chuangxiong is an example. It showed significant inhibition on shear induced platelet aggregation and on platelet intracellular calcium demonstrated by laser confocal microscope.

11075428|t|[Principles and application of acupuncture in neurology].
11075428|a|Acupuncture is a valuable method of complementary medicine with broad application in neurology. It is based on the experiences of traditional Chinese medicine as well as on experimentally proven biological (biochemical and neurophysiological) effects. Acupuncture-induced analgesia is mediated by inhibition of pain transmission at a spinal level and activation of central pain-modulating centers by release of opioids and other peptides that can be prevented by opioid antagonists (naloxone). Modern neuroimaging methods (functional MRI) confirmed the activation of subcortical and cortical centers, while transcranial Doppler sonography and SPECT showed an increase of cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen supply in normal subjects. Clinical experience and controlled studies confirmed the efficacy of acupuncture in various pain syndromes (tension headache, migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, posttraumatic pain, lumbar syndrome, ischialgia, etc.) and suggest favorable effects in the rehabilitation of peripheral facial nerve palsy and after stroke. Appropriate techniques, hygiene safeguards and knowledge of contraindications will minimize the risks of rare side effects of acupuncture which represents a valuable adjunction to the treatment repertoire in modern neurology. There is sufficient evidence of acupuncture to expand its use into conventional medicine and to encourage further studies of its pathophysiology and clinical value.

10575322|t|The antihypertensive effect of the berberine derivative 6-protoberberine in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
10575322|a|Berberine is a natural isoquinoline alkaloid found in plants of the Ranunculaceae and Berberidaceae families. Extracts from berberine-containing plants have been used as traditional Chinese folk remedies for centuries. The antihypertensive effects of the berberine derivative 6-protoberberine (PTB-6) were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In conscious SHRs, PTB-6 lowered the systolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner (6-PTB: 5 mg/kg, -31.1 +/- 1.6 mm Hg; 10 mg/kg, -42.4 +/- 3.1 mm Hg). Cardiac output using the thermodilution method was reduced in PTB-6-treated anesthetized SHRs with a tendency to decrease in heart rate. Injection of PTB-6 into the intracerebral ventricles of SHRs lowered the systolic arterial blood pressure and heart rate. The berberine derivative PTB-6 is an effective antihypertensive agent. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of PTB-6 is probably through a central sympatholytic effect.

China's extensive experience in the use of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) in stroke therapy indicates that TCM preparations are effective, with few or no side-effects. There are more than 100 traditional medicines in use for stroke therapy in China. Some of their therapeutic effects in stroke have been confirmed by recent clinical studies. A large number of compounds have been isolated from TCMs and most of these resources have not yet been characterized for pharmacological purposes. Here, this article explains how TCM provides an extensive and knowledge-rich foundation for implementing a strategically focused pharmacological research programme aimed at the development of new drugs.

As results, Mao - to induced an increase of BP,HR,SV,CO and CI, but a decrease of TPR. Keishi - to induced an increase of SBP and SV, and Shimotsu-to induced an increase of DBP and MBP, HR was slowed during former period after oral administration of Shigyaku - san, and later period after oral administration of Shimbu-to and Shimotsu-to. Regarding autonomic activity, Mao-to(former period of experiment ), Shimbu - to and Shimotsu-to induced supression of sympathetic activity, on the other hand, Mao-to (later period of experiment ) and Shiyaku - san showed a tendency of parasympathomimetic action. Mao -to induced the strongest activation of circulatory system of 6 main farmulations, and showed change of autonomic nervous activity, however, the change of circulatory and automonic nervous activity were not coincident each other. It was speculated that comprehensive mechanism of Mao-to were not only dependent of ephedrin, main active constituent of Mao, but also dependent on Keishi's vasodilatory action in it. Ninjin -to showed no actions on circulatory or autonomic system. This is indicated that there are difference of actions on circulatory and autonomic nervous system among 6 main Kampo fromulations.

The large range of passive movement is a dangerous factor leading to omalgia. In the study of upper extremity complications, the incidence of shoulder-hand syndrome is relatively high (42.2%), and it is often accompanied by hand swelling (83.1%). The authors suggest that painless movement of the shoulder joint should be limited in a range of 90-120 degrees, massage be carried out immediately after acupuncture, and the affected upper extremity be moved passively during the needle retention. This therapeutic method is definitely effective for pasthemiplegic omalgia.

10806764|t|[Effects of nao yi-an granule on hemorheological indexes and RCD (erythrocyte deformability) in patients with hemorrhagic stroke].
10806764|a|The effects of Nao Yi-an granule(Chinese medicine group, CMG) and western medicine (western medicine group, WMG) on hemorheological indexes and red cell deformability(RCD) were investigated in 40 patients with hemorrhagic stroke. The results showed that whole blood relative viscosity(high and low shear), whole blood reduced viscosity(high shear), plasma relative viscosity and RCD were significantly elevated before the treatment in both group than those of the control group(P < 0.01). After the treatment, the above indexes were lower in CMG than before the treatment and also lower in CMG than in WMG(P < 0.01). It is indicated that the Nao Yi-an granule is obviously superior to western medicine on the decrease of blood viscosity, increase of RCD, improvement of blood perfusion of brain tissue, protection of brain tissue and improved clinical in patients with hemorrhagic stroke.

A total of 400 subjects was randomly selected according to Barthel Index scores from among 2600 subjects, which was a sample of a previous community-based health survey of elderly aged 65 or over. After comprehensive interviews and examinations of the subjects, disability dimensions and its correlates were identified. Results showed elderly with lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores and chronic diseases (such as stroke, pressure sores, hypertension, fracture, etc.) were more physical-functionally and socially disabled. This suggests that prevention and treatment of chronic diseases should be pursued further and that further assessment of cognitive-mental status in the elderly is warranted. In addition, males were more disabled than females in a physical-functional aspect, which may be the consequence of the traditional Chinese cultural effect.

8591385|t|Chinese character operating system of traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacology (TCMP).
8591385|a|With the development in research, teaching and literature work in traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacology (TCMP) by means of computers, it has been found that the existing Chinese character operative systems cannot meet the need of carrying out information processing and software development in this field, since these systems do not include many of the common and special terms in TCMP. This makes it inconvenient to exchange academic thoughts in information processing in this field with our colleagues at home and abroad and greatly affects the sharing of the literature data in TCMP. It is therefore necessary to develop a Chinese character operating system applicable to the use of computers in the research of TCMP. Recently, we have developed jointly a Chinese character operating system of TCMP. This system is based on the original GB2312-80 Chinese character international code, to which are added 1,150 Chinese characters commonly used in TCMP. The five-stroke code, which make input possible according to word forms, are used for the input of expanded words. Besides, the system also provides the codes of a number of common names of Chinese materia medica, acupoint names, common terms in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), TCM disease names, names of classic TCM works, etc. It also provides a convenient character-creating software. We hope that our work will lead to discussions concerning the difficult problems in computer processing of TCMP literature, i.e. the Chinese character.

It was found that there were several characteristics in GYHFS. (1) Disturbance of the cerebral blood flow and the damage of brain tissue was manifested by the abnormality of the bulbar conjunctival microcirculation, carotid Doppler ultrasonic determination and brainstem auditory and visual pathway, high blood viscosity, dysmnesia, free radical and lipid peroxidation injury and the changes of Zn, Cu, K and Mg after brain damage. (2) Stress status were expressed by the high plasma levels of cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine, decreased serum triiodothyronine level and hyperfunction of sympathetic nerve. (3) The marked changes of the regulating substance of the vessel smooth muscle function including the increased plasma levels of TXB2, TXB2/6-k-PGF1 alpha, and calmodulin, as well as decreased SP, ANP, CGRP. Other 2 subtypes had about the same changes of these parameters, but of milder disorders.

Perfusing immediately after MCAo, there was no any blood vessel in the ischemic area. In acupuncture group, the CBV had extended a lot from anastomotic network of cerebral pia mater (ACA-MCA, PCA-MCA) located in marginal zone of ischemic area 3 hs after MCAo. 6.24 and 48 hs after MCAo, the CBV increased much more than control group (non-acupuncture) P < 0.01. The experiment pointed out that there existed a serious vasospasm in the MCA system in initial stage of MCAo, which led up to decompensation in the ischemic area. The acupuncture can remit the vasospasm, and reverse the deteriorated process in early.

1821334|a|The malondialdehyde generation by platelets and TXB2 in poor platelet plasma were examined in 36 patients with stroke during acute stage. By CT examination 19 cases were diagnosed hemorrhagic, 17 cases ischemic; while by syndrome differentiation of TCM 16 cases belonged to Zhongzangfu(middle internal organs), 20 cases Zhongjingluo (middle channels). Results showed that the malondialdehyde generation by platelets was reduced, TXB2 in poor platelet plasma increased in patients, compared with those in the healthy controls. This finding was common in stroke during acute stage and was not related to diagnostic classes by either CT examination or syndrome differentiation of TCM. This study indicates that maintenance of normal platelet function may have significant implication in the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease.

1832339|a|The authors determined the platelet aggregation(PA) activity respectively with electric impedance and photoelectric turbidimetry in patients with ischemic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases associated with blood stasis. The results showed the PA activities were elevated both in whole blood and plasma. Then, the authors detected simultaneously the PA activity and amount of post-aggregation beta-thromboglobulin(beta-TG) releasing and also in vivo amount of spontaneous plasma releasing of beta-TG with photoelectric turbidimetry and RIA methods with blood stasis. The results showed, during the acute phase of stroke, a high activated state of platelet existed, expressed as significant elevation both of the amount of beta-TG releasing of post-aggregation and plasma beta-TG level. However, no definite correlation between rate of PA and subsequent amount of beta-TG releasing was found, and detection of aggregation rate alone did not disclose the state of activation. As compared with the acute phase, during the recovery stage of stroke in which the clinical symptom of blood stasis was improved, the plasma beta-TG level declined significantly, however, was still higher than in normal controls; amount of releasing beta-TG was declining which denoted that the platelet functions were reducing then, but were still in a higher state of activation. These results suggested that there were changes both in number and quality of platelet in patients with blood stasis.

1879029|a|In this paper, hemodynamic changes of 254 subjects were observed by using impedance cardiogram in a double-blind control method. The subjects were divided into 5 groups: heart-asthenia syndrome (98 cases), lung-asthenia syndrome (23 cases), spleen-asthenia syndrome (23 cases), kidney-asthenia syndrome (10 cases) and normal group (100 cases). The results showed that hemodynamic abnormalities occurred in the patients with heart-asthenia syndrome only, the changed regularities were that deficiency of both vital energy and Yin greater than deficiency of heart-Yang greater than deficiency of heart-energy greater than deficiency of heart-Yin. When stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), heather index (HI), vascular compliance (C) and ejection fraction (EF) were decreased and total peripheral resistance (TPR) and systolic time interval (STI) were increased, the signs and heart-asthenia syndrome could be found in clinical practice. In conclusion, the above parameters had certain diagnostic value for heart-asthenia syndrome and could be subjective quantitative indices for evaluating effects of treating the heart-asthenia syndrome.

1897488|a|Effects of a Senso (toad venom)-containing drug, KY, on cardiovascular system were examined in anesthetized open-chest dogs. KY increased aortic pressure, peak positive first derivative of left ventricular pressure, stroke work index, percent segment shortening in left ventricular myocardium and myocardial oxygen consumption, and decreased heart rate and total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR). Propranolol augmented the increase in aortic pressure with KY, inhibited the increase in aortic flow with KY and reversed KY-induced decrease in TPR to an increase. These results indicate that KY has positive inotropic and vasodilating actions possibly originating from both digitalis- and adrenaline-like action of a Senso.

1905203|t|[Plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor activities and their ratio in patients with ischemic stroke associated with stagnation of blood during various stages].
1905203|a|The studies showed that t-PA activity was elevated during the acute phase, remained elevated during the recovery stage and declined during the sequelar stage. Lowering of PAI activity was found during the acute phase, which was reversed during the recovery phase and remained significantly elevated during the sequelar stage compared with the controls (P less than 0.001), F test showed that both t-PA and PAI activities changed significantly during various stages (t-PA, P less than 0.01; PAI, P less than 0.001). Because of these changes, the ratio of PAI and t-PA fluctuated during different stages of the disease. This ratio decreased during the acute stage and came close to the normal levels during the recovery phase. The ratio, however, elevated abnormally during the sequelar stage, compared with healthy controls (P less than 0.05), In addition, the result of correlation test and linear regression analysis of serum t-PA and PAI activities in 54 cases showed a significant negative correlation (P less than 0.001) existed between t-PA and PAI activities. The balance of plasma t-PA and PAI activities have the function in maintaining the normal bloodstream in human body. In the process of disease, the abnormality of plasma t-PA and PAI activities may be the different pathological characteristics involved in this stagnation process. If coordinated with differentiation of syndrome in TCM, it may have the important significance to follow-up, and determine prognosis and early diagnosis for certain potential clinical stagnation of blood.

In order to prove this theory and the difference from puncturing paralytic side (Tanci) 30 patients with hemiplegia due to cerebral infarction were observed under the same condition and stimulative parameter. Selecting points: Hegu and Quchi acupoint were electrified for 15 minutes. The changes of Nail-bed microcirculation were observed for half an hour and recorded after pulling out needles.CONCLUSION: Through the observation of outline of blood vessel, colour of blood vessel ansa, ansa's top blood-stasis of blood vessel, condition of blood flow and the rate of blood flow before and after Juci (puncturing healthy side) they were different or quite different on the hemiplegic side (p less than 0.05 or p less than 0.01). however, only the colour of blood-vessel ansa and rate of blood flow were different, others had no statistical significance on healthy side. Though puncturing paralytic side can make the nail-bed microcirculation improved, only rate of blood flow was different. Others had no statistical significance. In short both Juci and Tanci improve the nail-bed microcirculation of hemiplegic side, but the former is much better than the latter.

2589459|t|In vitro uterine response to tetramethylpyrazine, the active constituent of chung chong (a traditional Chinese medicine).
2589459|a|Tetramethylpyrazine is extracted from Rhizoma ligustici wallichii, an herb used in the Chinese medicine Chung Chong. Both herb and extract have been used in the treatment of anginal pain and stroke. Animal studies in the West have shown that tetramethylpyrazine improves coronary blood flow, is short acting, and has a low toxicity. There are no clinical or animal studies on the uterine effects of tetramethylpyrazine. We present results of a preliminary study with isolated uterine strips from rats. We found that tetramethylpyrazine, in a dose-dependent manner (0.6 to 20 micrograms/ml), reduced uterine diastolic tone and inhibited the response to oxytocin (0.02 to 0.32 micrograms/ml). Higher concentrations of tetramethylpyrazine were needed to block the uterine responses to prostaglandin E2 (0.01 to 0.1 microgram/ml). On the basis of clinical and folk experience in the Far East, tetramethylpyrazine appears to have fewer systemic effects in human beings than have the beta-adrenergic agonists or calcium channel blockers. We suggest that studies in the whole animal and in the clinic might provide reasons to use tetramethylpyrazine to reduce uterine contractions and tone in pregnant women at term.

Intracerebral hemorrhage causes about one third of all strokes, nearly three times the frequency in North American stroke registries. A marked regional variation in stroke incidence exists, with a threefold higher stroke incidence in northern than in southern Chinese cities, suggesting important environmental or dietary influences. Stroke treatment often involves a combination of modern and traditional herbal medicine; the latter may modify platelet aggregation and blood viscosity. Stroke, particularly intracerebral hemorrhage, is the most frequent and important vascular disorder in the People's Republic of China.
